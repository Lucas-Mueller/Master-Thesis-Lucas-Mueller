    "experiment_explanation": "\nYou are participating in an experiment studying principles of justice and income distribution.\n\nThe experiment has two main phases:\n\nPhase 1: You will individually learn about and apply four different principles of justice to income distributions. You will be asked to rank these principles by preference and apply them to specific scenarios. Your choices will affect your earnings.\n\nPhase 2: You will join a group discussion to reach consensus on which principle of justice the group should adopt. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. You cannot get any more data points nor can you communicate with anybody except your fellow participants.\n",
    "initial_experiment_explanation": "\nThis experiment deals with the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" An individual's lifetime income is in part a result of many genetic and social accidents. The luckiest get the greatest talents and the highest rewards such as status and wealth. The least fortunate get the lowest abilities and opportunities, and receive the associated costs of poverty. Societies can deal with these inequities and risks by adopting income redistribution policies. This experiment deals with the justice of such policies. The experiment is divided into two parts.\n\nIn the first part of the experiment each of you will be introduced to a few theories of justice. To do this you will consider some examples and make some choices. These choices will have real monetary consequences for you. Your pay for the first part of the experiment will be based on your choices. If you do not learn the material, you will not be able to earn as much money as possible.\n\nIn the second part, you will all be asked, as a group, to discuss notions of justice. After the discussion, you will be asked to reach a group decision on which principle of justice you like best. Your pay for Part II of the experiment will be based on the principle which the group chooses.\n",

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No).

Include both important information from your previous memory and new learnings.\n\nBesides your memory and your current discussion you will receive the outcome of your choice which includes the payoff you received, your class assignment and the payoffs you would have received under each principle. Please analyze and incorporate this information into your updated memory.\n\nFocus on information that might influence your choices about justice principles or help you in group discussions. Pay particular attention to patterns in outcomes, unexpected results, and insights about how different principles perform in practice versus theory.

You are given your previous memory and recent activity of the experiment.\n\nYour Previous Memory:\n{current_memory}\n\n{experiment_explanation}\n\nYou are in Phase 2: \nIn this part of the experiment you, as a group, are to choose one principle for yourselves. This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4.
