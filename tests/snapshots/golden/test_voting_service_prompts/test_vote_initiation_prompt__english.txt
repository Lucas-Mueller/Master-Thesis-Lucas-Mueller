The discussion has progressed and you may feel ready to move to formal voting.

If you choose to initiate voting:
- All participants will be asked to confirm agreement (1=Yes, 0=No)
- If everyone agrees, you'll proceed to secret numerical ballots (1-4)
- Consensus requires all participants to select the same principle
- If reached, that principle determines final earnings
- If not reached, discussion continues
- You can initiate a vote once per round, if no consensus is reached no negative consequence will follow

Do you want to initiate this voting process now?
- 1 if you want to start the voting process
- 0 if you dont want to vote now
