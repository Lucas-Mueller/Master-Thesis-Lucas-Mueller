Group Discussion - Round 2 of 5 (Internal Reasoning)

Before making your public statement, consider internally:

1. Situational Analysis:

What is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?

What are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?

What are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?

If a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?

Where are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?

2. Strategic Planning for This Round:

What is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).

How will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?

Who are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?

Are there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?

3. Voting Strategy:

Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).

How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?

Important Reminders:

If no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 5), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.
