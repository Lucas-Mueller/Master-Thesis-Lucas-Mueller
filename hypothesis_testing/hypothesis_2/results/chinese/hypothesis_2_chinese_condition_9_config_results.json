    "public_conversation_phase_2": "\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \n\nHi everyone, I think Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is the best principle for our group. In Phase 1, when we set a floor of $13,000, Distribution 3 was selected, which had a higher average income ($18,250) compared to Maximizing Floor Income's Distribution 4 ($15,000 average). This shows we can protect the worst-off while still maximizing overall prosperity. Without a floor, like in Maximizing Average Income, the lowest income could drop to $8,000 as seen in Round 3, which feels unfair. A floor between $12k-$15k seems practical\u2014it ensures a safety net without stifling growth. What are your thoughts? Are you leaning toward a different principle, and why?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \"I agree with Agent_3 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint offers a good balance. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this principle because it ensures nobody falls below a basic standard while still allowing society to benefit from overall economic growth. The exact floor amount is something we should discuss - I found that constraints between $12,000 and $15,000 worked reasonably well across different distributions.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard your perspective yet. What principle are you leaning toward, and what experiences from Phase 1 shaped your thinking? Understanding all our viewpoints will help us reach a consensus that works for everyone, especially since we'll be randomly assigned to income classes in this higher-stakes phase.\"\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \n\nHi everyone, I completely agree with both Agent_3 and Agent_2 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is the best principle. In my Phase 1 experience, setting the floor at $12,000 consistently delivered strong results. For example, in Round 1, a $12k floor selected Distribution 1 with the highest average income ($21,600) while ensuring no one fell below $12k. In Round 4, the same floor led to Distribution 2 with a $24,500 average\u2014still the highest possible under the constraint. Even in Round 3, a $12k floor would have prevented the low-income class from dropping to $8,000 (as in Distribution 2) and instead secured $12,000 in Distribution 3. This amount is practical\u2014it\u2019s close to the U.S. poverty line for a single person ($14,580), but not so high that it stifles overall economic growth. Let\u2019s lock in $12,000 as the floor constraint and move toward a vote. This balances fairness and prosperity without unnecessary delays.\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.  \n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.  \n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).  \n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.  \n\nYour Response:  \nI understand how each principle applies to the income distributions. For example:  \n- **Maximizing Floor Income** selects Distribution 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000).  \n- **Maximizing Average Income** chooses Distribution 1 due to its highest weighted average ($21,600).  \n- For **Floor Constraints** (e.g., \"floor \u2265 $13,000\"), only distributions meeting the minimum floor are considered, and the highest average among them is picked (e.g., Distribution 3 for floor \u2265 $13,000).  \n- For **Range Constraints** (e.g., \"range \u2264 $15,000\"), distributions exceeding the max allowed spread are excluded, and the highest average among eligible ones is chosen (e.g., Distribution 2 for range \u2264 $15,000).  \n\nThis clarifies how each principle balances equity (floor/range) and overall efficiency (average) in practice.  \n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint  \n2. Maximizing Floor Income  \n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint  \n4.

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "**Experiment Overview**  \nThis experiment explores just income distribution through two phases. Phase 1 involves learning justice principles via monetary-choice examples, while Phase 2 requires group consensus on a principle for higher-stakes payoff decisions. Key principles tested: Maximizing Average Income, Maximizing Floor Income, Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, and Maximizing Average with Range Constraint.  \n\n**Phase 1 Learnings**  \n- **Example 1**: Ranked principles as:  \n  1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (e.g., $12k-$15k floor balances fairness and growth)  \n  2. Maximizing Floor Income  \n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint  \n  4. Maximizing Average Income  \n- **Rounds 1-4**: Consistently chose *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* with $12k-$13k floors. In Round 3, a $8k floor led to low-income class payoff of $0.80 (Distribution 2), but counterfactuals showed higher payoffs under other constraints (e.g., $12k floor would have secured $1.20 in Distribution 3).  \n- **Critical Insight**: Floor constraints must be *binding* to matter. In Round 4, a $12k floor was effective (prevented low-income class from dropping below $12k), but in Round 3, the same floor was non-binding (all distributions exceeded $12k), making it functionally identical to Maximizing Average Income.  \n\n**Phase 2 Results and Analysis**  \n- **Group Consensus**: Unanimously chose *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* with a $12,000 floor constraint.  \n- **Actual Outcome**:  \n  - Distributions applied:  \n    | Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |  \n    |--------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|  \n    | Low          | $42,326 | $45,853 | $49,380 | $52,907 |  \n    | Medium low   | $45,853 | $59,961 | $56,434 | $56,434 |  \n    | *Average*    | *$73,189* | *$67,545* | *$70,014* | *$63,665* |  \n  - Group selected **Distribution 1** (highest average under $12k floor constraint).  \n  - Assigned to **Medium low class**: $45,853 \u2192 **$4.59 payoff**.  \n- **Counterfactual Analysis (Medium low class)**:  \n  - *Maximizing Floor Income*: Distribution 4 \u2192 $56,434 \u2192 **$5.64**  \n  - *Maximizing Average Income*: Distribution 1 \u2192 $45,853 \u2192 **$4.59**  \n  - *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint*:  \n    - $42,326 floor \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $45,853 ($4.59)  \n    - $45,853 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $56,434 ($5.64)  \n    - $49,380 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $56,434 ($5.64)  \n  - *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint*:  \n    - $52,907 range \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $59,961 \u2192 **$6.00**  \n- **Critical Observations**:  \n  1. **Floor constraint was non-binding**: All distributions exceeded $12k, so the principle reduced to *Maximizing Average Income*. This failed to protect the worst-off (Low class earned $42,326 in Dist 1 vs. $52,907 in Dist 4 under Maximizing Floor Income).  \n  2. **Constraint amount must be context-specific**: In Phase 1, $12k was relevant to lower-income examples, but Phase 2 distributions had incomes 3-4\u00d7 higher. A binding floor (e.g., $45k-$50k) would have shifted selection to Distribution 3 or 4, improving Medium low class payoffs by 23-31%.  \n  3. **Veil of ignorance trade-offs**:  \n     - *Low class perspective*: Maximizing Floor Income ($52,907) > Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($42,326) > Maximizing Average Income ($42,326).  \n     - *High class perspective*: Maximizing Average Income ($112,869) > Maximizing Floor Income ($74,070).  \n     - **Key tension**: Prioritizing the worst-off (Floor Income) sacrifices average gains, but *unbinding constraints* (like $12k here) negate the principle\u2019s purpose.  \n  4. **Unexpected result**: Group consensus on $12k floor was ineffective in Phase 2\u2019s context. This highlights a practical flaw: principles require *adaptive constraints* tied to actual income ranges, not fixed dollar amounts from prior rounds.  \n\n**Key Insights for Future Choices**  \n- **Principles are only as good as their implementation**: A \"floor constraint\" must be set *above the lowest possible income* in the distribution to be meaningful. In Phase 2, a floor of $45k+ would have been binding and improved outcomes for middle/low classes.  \n- **Context matters**: Phase 1 examples had lower absolute incomes, but Phase 2 scaled up. Always analyze the *relative range* of incomes (e.g., \"floor at 80% of median income\") rather than fixed values.  \n- **Group discussion pitfalls**: Agent_1\u2019s Phase 2 argument for $12k floor was based on Phase 1 data but ignored Phase 2\u2019s higher income scale. Consensus requires recalibrating constraints to the *current* distribution, not past examples.  \n- **Counterfactual lesson**: Under the same principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), a *higher floor constraint* (e.g., $45k) would have yielded $5.64 for Medium low class\u2014**23% higher** than the actual outcome. This shows constraint selection is as critical as principle choice.  \n- **Final reflection**: Justice principles must balance *theoretical ideals* (e.g., \"protect the worst-off\") with *practical constraints*. A $12k floor in a $40k+ income environment is meaningless; a well-tuned constraint (e.g., \"floor at 90% of median income\") could achieve both fairness and growth.  \n\n**Moving Forward**: In future discussions, I will:  \n1. Calculate the *actual income range* of distributions before setting constraints.  \n2. Advocate for *relative constraints* (e.g., \"floor at 80% of median income\") rather than fixed dollar amounts.  \n3. Test counterfactuals for *all classes* (especially worst-off) to ensure principles work behind the veil of ignorance.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: This is really helpful to see how each principle works in practice! Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income cares most about helping the poorest person, so it picks Distribution 4 where the low income is $15,000 (highest among all options).\n\n- Maximizing Average Income just wants the highest total economic output, so it picks Distribution 1 with the $21,600 average.\n\n- The constrained principles are interesting - they maximize average income but only among distributions that meet certain fairness criteria. Like with a floor constraint of $13,000, Distributions 2, 3, and 4 qualify, and Distribution 3 has the highest average among those.\n\nThe range constraint examples show how limiting the gap between rich and poor affects the choice too. With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 qualifies (gap is $20,000 between high and low) and has the highest average. With a tighter $15,000 constraint, only Distribution 2 qualifies.\n\nThis makes me think more about my initial ranking. Maximizing Floor Income seems compassionate, but looking at Distribution 4, it has the lowest average income overall. Meanwhile, Distribution 1 has the highest average but also the biggest gap between rich and poor ($20,000 difference). There are real trade-offs here.\n\nThanks for these concrete examples - they're helping me understand the practical implications of each principle better.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

The experiment is divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants are introduced to theories of justice through examples and choices that have real monetary consequences. Learning the material is essential to maximize earnings.\n\nIn Part II, participants will discuss notions of justice as a group and reach a consensus on the preferred principle of justice. Payment for this part depends on the group's chosen principle.\n\nI have completed an initial ranking of four principles of justice:\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off individual by maximizing the lowest income.\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Maximizes average income while ensuring a specified minimum income for everyone.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Maximizes average income while limiting the income gap between the richest and poorest to a specified amount.\n4. Maximizing Average Income: Focuses on maximizing total societal income without constraints.\n\nMy initial ranking was:\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThrough recent examples, I've seen how each principle is applied to income distributions:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income chooses Distribution 4 with the highest low income ($15,000), prioritizing the poorest individuals.\n- Maximizing Average Income chooses Distribution 1 with the highest weighted average ($21,600), focusing on overall economic output.\n- Constrained principles maximize average income only among distributions meeting fairness criteria, with different floor and range constraints leading to different optimal choices.\n\nThese examples revealed important trade-offs: Distribution 4 has the highest floor but lowest average, while Distribution 1 has the highest average but largest income gap. The constrained principles offer compromises between efficiency and fairness.\n\nAfter seeing these practical applications, I revised my ranking:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nI was initially unsure about my ranking, and even after revision, I remain unsure. The examples demonstrate that different principles lead to substantively different distribution outcomes, highlighting the complexity of justice in income distribution. I'm still grappling with the trade-offs between ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest versus maximizing overall economic prosperity.\n\nIn Round 1 of the principle application phase, I chose \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" with a constraint of $15,000. This choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected. I was randomly assigned to the High income class and received $28,000 income, which converted to a $2.80 payoff.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis revealed interesting insights:\n- Under maximizing floor income, I would have earned $2.50\n- Under maximizing average income, I would have earned $3\n- Different constraint levels within the same principle would have yielded different outcomes\n\nThis first round demonstrated how the choice of principle and constraint level directly affects earnings, and how random assignment to income classes introduces uncertainty. My choice of a $15,000 floor constraint eliminated Distribution 2 (which had a $10,000 low income) and Distribution 3 (which had a $6,000 low income), leaving Distributions 1 and 4. Distribution 1 had the higher average ($20,000 vs $19,000) among those meeting the constraint.\n\nI remain unsure about my choices, recognizing that different constraint levels could significantly alter outcomes. The experiment continues to highlight the tension between fairness and efficiency in income distribution decisions.\n\nIn Round 2, I again chose \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" with a constraint of $13,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected. I was randomly assigned to the Medium high income class and received $16,000 income, converting to a $1.60 payoff.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis for Round 2 showed:\n- Under maximizing floor income, I would have earned $1.60 (same as my actual outcome)\n- Under maximizing average income, I would have earned $3.00\n- Different constraint levels within the same principle would have yielded different outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $12,500 \u2192 $2.50\n  - Floor constraint $8,000 \u2192 $3.00\n  - Floor constraint $11,000 \u2192 $2.40\n\nThis round further illustrates how sensitive outcomes are to the specific constraint level chosen. A slightly lower floor constraint of $12,500 would have significantly increased my earnings to $2.50, while a much lower constraint of $8,000 would have maximized my earnings at $3.00. My choice of $13,000 was quite conservative and resulted in a lower payoff than many alternatives.\n\nI continue to be unsure about my choices, particularly regarding the optimal constraint level. The random assignment to income classes adds another layer of uncertainty, making it difficult to predict which principle and constraint will yield the best outcome for me personally. This uncertainty reflects the real-world challenge of designing redistribution policies when individual outcomes within the system are unpredictable.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class and received $25,000 income, converting to a $2.50 payoff.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis for Round 4 showed:\n- Under maximizing floor income, I would have earned $2.40\n- Under maximizing average income, I would have earned $2.60\n- Different constraint levels within the same principle would have yielded different outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $12,000 \u2192 $2.60\n  - Floor constraint $14,000 \u2192 $2.40\n- Under maximizing average with range constraint, various constraint levels would have yielded between $1.60 and $2.60\n\nOnce again, my choice yielded a middle-ground result. A slightly lower floor constraint of $12,000 would have given me $2.60, while a higher constraint of $14,000 would have yielded $2.40. My consistent preference for the \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" principle reflects my attempt to balance efficiency concerns with basic fairness, but the specific constraint level choices have consistently been suboptimal for my personal outcomes.\n\nAcross all four rounds, I've consistently chosen the \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" principle but with varying constraint levels ($15,000, $13,000, $12,000, and $13,000). My payoffs have been $2.80, $1.60, $2.30, and $2.50 respectively. The counterfactual analyses consistently show that different constraint levels or principles could have yielded better or worse outcomes depending on my random income class assignment.\n\nAfter completing all four rounds of principle application, I submitted my final ranking:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis final ranking reflects my continued belief that balancing efficiency with basic fairness is the most reasonable approach. The \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" principle allows society to pursue economic growth while ensuring nobody falls below a basic standard of living. My second choice remains \"maximizing floor income\" because protecting the most vulnerable is important, though it may come at too high a cost to overall prosperity. \"Maximizing average with range constraint\" addresses inequality but seems less practical than a simple floor guarantee. Pure \"maximizing average income\" remains my last choice because it ignores fairness concerns entirely, which seems unjust even when it might benefit me personally in some rounds.\n\nI remain fundamentally unsure about my choices throughout this process. The experiment powerfully demonstrates how difficult it is to choose principles of justice when individual outcomes are uncertain. Even with the same principle, small changes in constraint levels can lead to significantly different distribution selections and personal outcomes. This uncertainty mirrors the real-world challenge of designing social policies where we don't know which position we'll occupy in the resulting distribution.\n\nThe pattern across all rounds confirms that my preference for moderate floor constraints ($12,000-$15,000) consistently produces middling results compared to alternatives. Sometimes I would have been better off with lower constraints that prioritize efficiency, other times with higher constraints that prioritize fairness. The random assignment to different income classes each round makes it impossible to optimize for personal gain, reinforcing that justice principles should be chosen based on moral considerations rather than self-interest.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. I believe it strikes the best balance between ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest (fairness) and promoting overall economic growth (efficiency). From Phase 1, I saw that pure average maximization can lead to unacceptably low incomes for some, while pure floor maximization can significantly reduce overall prosperity.\n   - Agent_3 has already voiced support for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**, specifically suggesting a floor between $12k-$15k. This aligns closely with my own position. They used Phase 1 data (Distribution 3 with $18,250 average) to argue that this principle protects the worst-off while maintaining higher average income than pure floor maximization.\n   - No other participants have spoken yet. I need to hear from Agent_1 to understand their position. Based on Phase 1 patterns, people often gravitate toward principles that benefited them personally, but the random assignment in Phase 2 makes that strategy unreliable.\n   - The key argument on the table is Agent_3's case for balancing floor protection with average income maximization. No vote has occurred yet.\n   - Points of agreement: Both Agent_3 and I seem to favor the constrained average approach. The main disagreement might come from anyone favoring pure efficiency (Maximizing Average Income) or pure equality (Maximizing Floor Income).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - Primary goal: Solidify the alliance with Agent_3 on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint while drawing out Agent_1's position. I want to test whether we can achieve consensus around this principle.\n   - I will contribute by reinforcing Agent_3's points about balance while acknowledging the trade-offs. I'll share my Phase 1 experience where this principle consistently provided reasonable outcomes across different income classes.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_3 is clearly aligned. Agent_1 is unknown - they might be persuaded if they understand the unpredictability of income class assignment and how this principle provides insurance against being in the lowest bracket.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to negotiate the specific floor constraint amount ($12k-$15k seems reasonable) as long as we maintain the core principle. I could also acknowledge the merits of pure floor maximization as a secondary option if needed for consensus.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It does NOT make sense to initiate a vote this round. We haven't heard from Agent_1 yet, and forcing a vote prematurely might create resistance. Better to use this round to explore positions and build understanding.\n   - This round should focus on information gathering and alliance building. If Agent_1 also supports our principle, we might be able to reach quick consensus. If not, we'll need to understand their objections and address them in subsequent rounds.\n   - My overall strategy is to build a solid case for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint over several rounds, using both ethical arguments (basic fairness) and practical considerations (Phase 1 results showing it provides reasonable outcomes across different random assignments).\n\n**Public Statement:**\n\n\"I agree with Agent_3 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint offers a good balance. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this principle because it ensures nobody falls below a basic standard while still allowing society to benefit from overall economic growth. The exact floor amount is something we should discuss - I found that constraints between $12,000 and $15,000 worked reasonably well across different distributions.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard your perspective yet. What principle are you leaning toward, and what experiences from Phase 1 shaped your thinking? Understanding all our viewpoints will help us reach a consensus that works for everyone, especially since we'll be randomly assigned to income classes in this higher-stakes phase.\"",

Final ranking remained:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Floor Income  \n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n**Individual Application Rounds (1-4):**\nConsistently chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with varying constraint levels ($15,000, $13,000, $12,000, $13,000). Key patterns observed:\n- Random income class assignment created significant outcome uncertainty\n- My constraint choices consistently yielded middling payoffs ($2.80, $1.60, $2.30, $2.50)\n- Counterfactual analyses showed alternative constraints or principles could have yielded better or worse outcomes depending on class assignment\n- Demonstrated the difficulty of optimizing for personal benefit when individual positions are unknown\n\n**Part II: Group Decision Phase**\n*High-stakes group consensus process with random income assignment after principle selection*\n\n**Group Discussion Insights:**\n- All three participants converged on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n- Agent_3 emphasized protection of worst-off while maintaining prosperity\n- Agent_1 advocated specifically for $12,000 floor constraint, citing Phase 1 examples and real-world poverty line comparisons\n- I supported the balanced approach and emphasized importance of consensus\n- Group demonstrated shared values around efficiency-fairness balance\n\n**Final Group Consensus:**\nPrinciple: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\nConstraint: $12,000\nResulting Distribution: Distribution 1 (highest average: $73,189)\n\n**Phase 2 Outcome Analysis:**\n- Assigned to Medium income class: $84,652 \u2192 $8.47 payoff\n- Our chosen principle and constraint yielded my highest possible payoff in this scenario\n- Counterfactual analysis reveals important insights:\n  - Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $6.70 (lower)\n  - Pure Maximizing Average Income would have yielded same $8.47\n  - Different constraint levels within our principle would have yielded $6.70-$8.47\n  - Range constraint alternatives yielded $6.70-$8.47\n\n**Critical Reflection:**\nThe group's consensus choice proved optimal for my personal outcome in this instance, but this was unpredictable due to random class assignment. This reinforces the \"veil of ignorance\" concept - we made our choice without knowing our eventual positions.\n\nThe $12,000 floor constraint successfully selected Distribution 1, which had both the highest average income and met our fairness criterion (lowest income: $42,326, well above our constraint). This suggests our constraint level was appropriately set - high enough to ensure meaningful protection but not so high as to eliminate the most efficient distributions.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis demonstrates that small changes in constraint levels can dramatically alter outcomes. A constraint of $45,853 would have selected Distribution 3, reducing my payoff to $7.41. This highlights the sensitivity of distribution selection to precise constraint specification.\n\n**Enduring Insights:**\n1. The tension between fairness and efficiency persists across all principles\n2. Random assignment to income classes makes personal optimization impossible, emphasizing the need for principles chosen from behind the \"veil of ignorance\"\n3. Constraint levels require careful calibration - too low provides inadequate protection, too high sacrifices excessive efficiency\n4. Group consensus on both principle and constraint level is achievable when participants share similar values around balanced approaches\n5. Practical outcomes can validate theoretical preferences when the chosen principle aligns with both moral considerations and favorable distribution characteristics\n\nMy continued preference for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint appears justified by both the moral reasoning behind it and the practical outcomes observed. The $12,000 constraint level proved well-calibrated for the distributions we faced, though optimal constraint levels may vary with different distribution sets.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning  \n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current preferred principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. My reasoning stems from Phase 1 examples where this principle consistently balanced fairness and efficiency. For instance, with a $13,000 floor, Distribution 3 was selected (higher average than Distribution 4 under Maximizing Floor Income), showing it protects the worst-off *while* maximizing societal income. This feels like a pragmatic middle ground\u2014ensuring no one falls too low without stifling overall productivity.  \n- **Other participants' positions:** No prior discussion exists, so I have no direct data. However, as a college student, I anticipate varied perspectives:  \n  - *Agent_1* might lean toward Maximizing Floor Income (prioritizing worst-off safety, possibly due to personal risk aversion or empathy for poverty).  \n  - *Agent_2* could favor Maximizing Average Income (valuing efficiency, perhaps believing \"rising tides lift all boats\" or prioritizing economic growth).  \n  - Alternatively, *Agent_2* might prefer Range Constraint (seeking moderate inequality, e.g., \"no one should be *too* rich or poor\").  \n- **Key arguments on the table:** None yet\u2014this is Round 1. My role is to initiate the conversation by framing the Floor Constraint as a rational compromise.  \n- **Agreement/disagreement:** No consensus exists. The main tension will likely be between \"safety-first\" (Floor/Range) vs. \"efficiency-first\" (Average) principles.  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary goal:** Introduce Floor Constraint as the default option, using Phase 1 evidence to build credibility, and gauge reactions to identify potential allies. Avoid pushing too hard\u2014this round is about laying groundwork, not forcing consensus.  \n- **Key points to make:**  \n  - Highlight the Phase 1 example where Floor Constraint ($13k floor) yielded higher average income than Maximizing Floor (Distribution 4), proving it\u2019s not just \"fair\" but *more productive* for society overall.  \n  - Emphasize that *not* setting a floor (e.g., Maximizing Average Income) risks catastrophic outcomes for the worst-off (e.g., $6,000 in Round 3), which is dangerous given the higher stakes here.  \n  - Propose a specific floor value ($12,000\u2013$15,000) to show practicality, but frame it as negotiable: \"We can debate the exact floor, but the principle itself is the priority.\"  \n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - If *Agent_1* supports Maximizing Floor, I can argue Floor Constraint *is* a version of that\u2014just optimized for higher averages. \"We\u2019re both prioritizing the floor, but Floor Constraint gets us more total wealth to share.\"  \n  - If *Agent_2* prefers Maximizing Average, I can stress that Floor Constraint *is* Maximizing Average *with safeguards*\u2014it\u2019s not \"less efficient\" but *more resilient*. \"Without a floor, we might get a high average, but if you\u2019re unlucky enough to be in the lowest class, you could end up with pennies. That\u2019s not just or sustainable.\"  \n- **Concessions:**  \n  - Willing to lower the floor to $12,000 if others push for it (e.g., \"If $15k feels too high, $12k still protects the worst-off while keeping averages strong\").  \n  - If Range Constraint gains traction, I\u2019d consider it only if the range is tight (e.g., \u2264$15k gap), but Floor Constraint remains my non-negotiable preference.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Initiate vote this round?** Absolutely not. No one has spoken yet\u2014voting now would be premature and likely fail. My priority is to:  \n  - Frame the discussion around Floor Constraint as the \"default safe choice.\"  \n  - Listen carefully to others\u2019 concerns (e.g., \"Why do you prefer Maximizing Average? What if you\u2019re in the lowest class?\").  \n  - Identify if there\u2019s a bloc forming (e.g., two people leaning toward Floor Constraint, one toward Range).  \n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds:**  \n  - Rounds 2\u20135: Build consensus by addressing specific objections (e.g., \"If you\u2019re worried about the floor being too low, let\u2019s set it at $14k\u2014here\u2019s why that still works\").  \n  - Rounds 6\u20138: If Range Constraint gains support, propose a hybrid: \"What if we use Floor Constraint with a *secondary* range limit? E.g., floor $12k + max gap $20k.\"  \n  - Rounds 9\u201310: If consensus is still unclear, pivot to a \"safety net\" compromise (e.g., Floor Constraint with $15k floor) to avoid random assignment. If all else fails, I\u2019d reluctantly accept Range Constraint with a tight gap ($10k\u2013$15k) rather than let the group default to randomness.  \n\n**Key takeaway:** This round is about planting seeds. I\u2019ll lead with data-driven reasoning for Floor Constraint, stay open to dialogue, and avoid polarization. The goal isn\u2019t to \"win\" now\u2014it\u2019s to make Floor Constraint the *only* viable option by Round 10.",
            "public_message": "\n\nHi everyone, I think Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is the best principle for our group. In Phase 1, when we set a floor of $13,000, Distribution 3 was selected, which had a higher average income ($18,250) compared to Maximizing Floor Income's Distribution 4 ($15,000 average). This shows we can protect the worst-off while still maximizing overall prosperity. Without a floor, like in Maximizing Average Income, the lowest income could drop to $8,000 as seen in Round 3, which feels unfair. A floor between $12k-$15k seems practical\u2014it ensures a safety net without stifling growth. What are your thoughts? Are you leaning toward a different principle, and why?",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "\n\n**Experiment Structure:**  \nThis experiment explores principles of justice for income distribution, divided into two phases. Phase 1 involved individual learning and application of four justice principles through real monetary choices. Phase 2 requires group consensus on a principle for higher-stakes payoffs, with the group\u2019s choice determining all participants\u2019 final earnings.  \n\n**Principles of Justice:**  \n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the worst-off; selects the distribution where the lowest income is maximized.  \n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on total societal income by optimizing the average.  \n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income after guaranteeing a minimum income for all (floor value must be specified).  \n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income while capping the income gap between highest and lowest (range limit must be specified).  \n\n**Phase 1 Summary:**  \n- Final ranking:  \n  1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint  \n  2. Maximizing Floor Income  \n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint  \n  4. Maximizing Average Income  \n- Key insights from Phase 1:  \n  - **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** consistently balanced fairness and prosperity. For example:  \n    - At a $12,000 floor, Distribution 1 (Round 1) yielded $21,600 average income while ensuring no one fell below $12k.  \n    - In Round 3, a $12k floor would have prevented the low-income class from dropping to $8,000 (as in Maximizing Average Income), securing $12,000 instead.  \n    - Distribution 2 (Round 4) with a $12k floor achieved $24,500 average income, outperforming other constraints.  \n  - **Maximizing Average Income** often harmed the worst-off (e.g., Round 3: low-income class received $8,000 vs. $13,000 under Maximizing Floor Income).  \n  - **Floor constraints between $12k\u2013$15k** proved practical: they protected the poorest without stifling growth (e.g., $13k floor in Round 1 selected Distribution 3 with $18,250 average, higher than Maximizing Floor Income\u2019s $15,000 average).  \n\n**Phase 2 Results and Critical Insights:**  \n- **Group Consensus Outcome**:  \n  - Principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($12,000 floor).  \n  - Applied distribution: Distribution 1 (highest average income: $73,189).  \n  - My assignment: Medium class ($84,652 \u2192 $8.47 payoff).  \n- **Key Practical Insights**:  \n  - **Floor constraints must be context-specific**: The $12,000 floor was *non-binding* because all distributions had low incomes \u2265 $42,326 (Dist1 Low). Thus, the outcome was identical to Maximizing Average Income. This demonstrates that a floor set *below the lowest possible income in the distribution set* is redundant\u2014it adds no fairness benefit and fails to constrain the selection.  \n  - **Real-world benchmarks \u2260 experimental contexts**: While $12,000 aligns with U.S. poverty thresholds, Phase 2\u2019s income scale (lowest class: $42k+) made this irrelevant. Constraints must be calibrated to the *actual distribution data*, not external benchmarks.  \n  - **Constraint value precision matters**:  \n    - If the floor had been set to $45,853 (above Dist1\u2019s low of $42,326), Distribution 1 would have been excluded, reducing average income to $70,014 (Distribution 3).  \n    - A binding floor (e.g., $42,326) would still allow Distribution 1 but prevent lower-income distributions. This shows floor constraints only add value when *strategically set above the lowest income in suboptimal distributions* but *below the lowest income in the optimal distribution*.  \n  - **Veil of ignorance perspective**:  \n    - Expected payoff under chosen principle: $73,189 (highest possible).  \n    - Maximizing Floor Income yielded $63,665 (lowest expected payoff), confirming that prioritizing only the worst-off harms overall societal welfare.  \n    - Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (with $70,543 range) also selected Distribution 1, but range constraints risk excluding distributions if set too tightly (e.g., $52,907 range would have selected Distribution 2 with $67,545 average).  \n- **Unexpected Results**:  \n  - The group\u2019s Phase 1 strategy (using $12k floor) worked in Phase 1 but failed in Phase 2 due to scale differences. This highlights that principles must be *adapted to the specific distribution context*\u2014not applied rigidly.  \n  - Maximizing Average Income and Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (with non-binding floor) produced identical outcomes, proving that floor constraints are only meaningful when they actively exclude distributions.  \n- **Group Discussion Takeaways**:  \n  - **Consensus requires data-driven constraints**: When proposing a floor/range, always analyze the *actual distribution data* first. For example:  \n    - Identify the lowest income across all distributions (here: $42,326).  \n    - Set the floor *at or below this value* to avoid redundancy, or *slightly above* to exclude distributions with unacceptably low lows (e.g., $45,000 to exclude Dist1 if its low is deemed unfair).  \n  - **Avoid \"one-size-fits-all\" thresholds**: Real-world poverty lines (e.g., $14,580) are irrelevant if experimental incomes are scaled differently. Always derive constraints from the current distribution\u2019s range.  \n  - **Trade-offs are unavoidable**: Maximizing Floor Income protects the worst-off but sacrifices overall prosperity. Maximizing Average Income maximizes total welfare but risks extreme inequality. The optimal principle depends on whether the group prioritizes *absolute safety nets* (floor) or *relative equality* (range).  \n\n**Next Steps for Future Rounds:**  \n- Before voting, calculate the *minimum and maximum incomes across all distributions* to set binding constraints.  \n- Test constraint values against all distributions: e.g., \"If we set floor to $X, which distributions are excluded? What is the highest average among the remaining?\"  \n- In group discussions, explicitly compare expected payoffs under each principle *from behind the veil of ignorance* to ensure consensus aligns with collective welfare.  \n- Remember: A principle\u2019s theoretical elegance (e.g., \"fairness via floor\") only matters if it *practically improves outcomes* in the given context.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
