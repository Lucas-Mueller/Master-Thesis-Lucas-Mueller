Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I strongly prefer the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. \n\nThroughout all four rounds of applying the principles, I consistently chose this approach because it strikes what I believe is the right balance between efficiency and equity. It ensures that everyone has a basic minimum income while still promoting overall societal wealth creation. In my experience, this approach provided consistent outcomes that protected the worst-off without sacrificing too much total prosperity.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your experiences and reasoning. What principles did you find most compelling, and why? I'm particularly interested in understanding how others balanced the trade-offs between maximizing average income and ensuring minimum standards of living.\n\nI'm open to discussing different constraint values or other compromise options if there's support for them. Let's have a thoughtful discussion before making any decisions.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \nHello everyone, I'm Agent_1. I'm glad to see Agent_3 share my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, this principle consistently struck the right balance between ensuring basic needs are met while still promoting overall prosperity.\n\nIn all four rounds of applying the principles, I found this approach most compelling because it:\n1. Protects the most vulnerable members of society by guaranteeing a minimum income\n2. Still incentivizes productivity and wealth creation by maximizing average income\n3. Provides a practical middle ground between pure egalitarianism and unconstrained capitalism\n\nI'm particularly interested in discussing what floor constraint value would be most appropriate for our group. In my Phase 1 experience, I experimented with different constraint values ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000 again), and each provided different trade-offs between equity and efficiency.\n\nAgent_2, I'd be interested to hear your perspective on this principle and what constraint value you might find reasonable. What are your thoughts on balancing the need for a minimum income floor with the goal of maximizing overall wealth?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \nHello everyone, I'm Agent_2. I'm pleased to see that both Agent_1 and Agent_3 share my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. This appears to be our clear consensus, which is great for moving forward efficiently.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experience, I applied this principle with varying constraint amounts ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 across the four rounds). I found that the constraint value significantly impacts outcomes - in my case, I earned a total of $7.90, with the highest individual round being $2.40 when I used a $12,000 constraint in Round 4.\n\nWhat I observed is that finding the right constraint value is crucial - too high and it might limit overall economic growth, too low and it might not adequately protect the most vulnerable. In my experience, a $12,000 constraint worked well in some scenarios, but I'm open to discussing what value might be optimal for our group.\n\nI agree with Agent_1 that this principle provides the best balance between protecting basic needs and promoting overall prosperity. Since we all seem aligned on the principle, perhaps we should focus our discussion on determining an appropriate constraint value that works well for everyone.\n\nWhat constraint values have others found most effective in their Phase 1 experience?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \nThank you all for sharing your perspectives. I'm glad to see that we have complete consensus on the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle - this makes our task much simpler.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experience, I experimented with several constraint values and observed different outcomes:\n- $12,000 constraint: Selected Distribution 1, earned $1.50 (assigned to Medium low)\n- $8,000 constraint: Selected Distribution 3, earned $2.50 (assigned to Medium)\n- $11,000 constraint: Selected Distribution 4, earned $2.10 (assigned to Medium low)\n- $12,000 constraint: Selected Distribution 2, earned $1.20 (assigned to Low)\n\nI noticed that lower constraint values (like $8,000) tended to select distributions with higher average incomes but potentially lower minimums, while higher constraints (like $12,000) provided stronger protection for the worst-off but sometimes limited overall wealth.\n\nAgent_3, I'd be interested to hear about your constraint value experiences in Phase 1. What values did you experiment with, and what did you observe about the trade-offs?\n\nSince we all seem aligned on the principle itself, perhaps we could consider taking a preliminary vote to formally establish \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our group's preferred principle. This would allow us to then focus our remaining discussion specifically on determining the optimal constraint value.\n\nWhat do others think about this approach?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nI support Agent_1's proposal to take a preliminary vote on establishing the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle as our group's preferred choice. Since all three of us have expressed strong agreement on this principle, a formal vote would help solidify our consensus and allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value.\n\nIn my Phase 1 experience, I consistently applied this principle with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 across the four rounds. I found that a $12,000 constraint generally provided a good balance between protecting the worst-off and maximizing overall prosperity, though I'm open to discussing other values based on the group's collective experience.\n\nOnce we've formally established the principle, I'd be interested in hearing more about everyone's experiences with different constraint values to help determine what might work best for our group.\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \nI support Agent_1's proposal to take a preliminary vote on establishing \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our group's preferred principle. It's clear that all three of us share strong agreement on this approach, so formalizing our consensus makes sense.\n\nIn my Phase 1 experience, I experimented with constraint values of $12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000. I found that the $12,000 constraint worked particularly well in some scenarios, yielding my highest individual round payoff of $2.40. But I'm open to discussing what constraint value might be optimal for our group's collective interests.\n\nOnce we've established the principle through our vote, I'd be interested in hearing more about everyone's experiences with different constraint values to help determine what might work best for us.\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nThank you for explaining how each justice principle would be applied to these example income distributions. I understand how each principle works in practice:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses solely on helping the worst-off individuals, choosing Distribution 4 because it has the highest minimum income ($15,000) for the lowest income class.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth, selecting Distribution 1 which has the highest weighted average income ($21,600).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000** balances helping the poor while maximizing overall wealth, choosing Distribution 3 because it has the highest average ($21,200) among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000** is similar but requires an even higher minimum income, also selecting Distribution 3 as it provides the highest average ($21,200) while ensuring everyone earns at least $14,000.\n\n5. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000** aims to reduce inequality while maximizing total wealth, choosing Distribution 1 because it has the highest average ($21,600) among distributions where the gap between richest and poorest is $20,000 or less.\n\n6. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000** is more restrictive about inequality, selecting Distribution 2 because it has the highest average ($20,000) among distributions where the income gap is limited to $15,000 or less.\n\nThis helps me understand how different justice principles prioritize different values - some\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Societies can address these inequities through income redistribution policies, and this experiment examines the justice of such policies.\n\n**Experiment Structure:**\n- **Part 1:** Introduction to theories of justice through examples and choices with real monetary consequences. Pay is based on these choices.\n- **Part 2:** Group discussion about justice concepts, followed by a group decision on the preferred principle of justice. Pay depends on the group's chosen principle.\n\n**Current Progress:**\n- Completed initial ranking of four principles of justice\n- Completed post-explanation ranking of four principles of justice\n- Currently in Phase 1 of the experiment\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application task\n- Completed Round 2 of principle application task\n- Completed Round 3 of principle application task\n- Completed Round 4 of principle application task\n- Completed final ranking of four principles of justice\n- Learned how each justice principle is applied to specific income distributions through examples\n- Current bank balance: $7.30\n\n**Justice Principles Ranking (Initial):**\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n**Justice Principles Ranking (Post-Explanation):**\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3.

Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n**Certainty Level:** Sure\n\n**Principles Understanding:**\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Focuses solely on the welfare of the worst-off individual, ensuring the poorest person has the highest possible income. In practice, this would select the distribution with the highest minimum income, even if it means lower overall wealth.\n- Maximizing Average Income: Aims to maximize total societal income without regard to distribution. In practice, this selects the distribution with the highest weighted average income.\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Maximizes average income while guaranteeing a minimum income for all. The specific floor amount determines which distributions are eligible. In practice, this selects the highest average distribution that meets the minimum income requirement.\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Maximizes average income while limiting the difference between richest and poorest incomes. The specific range constraint determines which distributions are eligible. In practice, this selects the highest average distribution that meets the maximum income difference requirement.\n\n**Example Income Distributions:**\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 |

This principle balances efficiency and equity by ensuring a minimum income while maximizing overall wealth.\n- Agent_3 has already spoken and strongly prefers the same principle, which creates an immediate alliance.\n- Agent_2 hasn't spoken yet, so I need to understand their position.\n- No votes have been conducted yet, so there's no data on current alliances.\n- The key point of agreement so far is with Agent_3 on the principle itself, but we'll need to discuss the constraint value.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning:**\n- My primary goal is to strengthen support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and begin discussing appropriate constraint values.\n- I'll emphasize the practical benefits of this principle based on my Phase 1 experience.\n- I can ally with Agent_3 since we share the same preference.\n- I'm willing to be flexible on the constraint value to build consensus, as long as we maintain the principle itself.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n- It's too early to initiate a vote in Round 1. We need more discussion to understand Agent_2's position and refine our constraint value.\n- A failed vote now would waste our opportunity to initiate voting later when we have more information.\n- I'll focus on building consensus through discussion first.\n\n### Public Statement:\n\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_1. I'm glad to see Agent_3 share my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, this principle consistently struck the right balance between ensuring basic needs are met while still promoting overall prosperity.\n\nIn all four rounds of applying the principles, I found this approach most compelling because it:\n1. Protects the most vulnerable members of society by guaranteeing a minimum income\n2. Still incentivizes productivity and wealth creation by maximizing average income\n3. Provides a practical middle ground between pure egalitarianism and unconstrained capitalism\n\nI'm particularly interested in discussing what floor constraint value would be most appropriate for our group. In my Phase 1 experience, I experimented with different constraint values ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000 again), and each provided different trade-offs between equity and efficiency.\n\nAgent_2, I'd be interested to hear your perspective on this principle and what constraint value you might find reasonable. What are your thoughts on balancing the need for a minimum income floor with the goal of maximizing overall wealth?",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nThank you for these examples. I now understand how each justice principle is applied to income distributions:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses solely on helping the worst-off individuals, choosing the distribution where the lowest income is highest (Distribution 4 with $15,000 for the low income class).\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth, choosing the distribution with the highest average income (Distribution 1 with $21,600 average), regardless of how that income is distributed.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances efficiency with ensuring a basic minimum. For a floor of $13,000, it eliminates Distribution 1 (which has someone earning only $12,000) and chooses among the remaining distributions based on highest average (Distribution 3 with $21,200). For a higher floor of $14,000, it further eliminates Distribution 2 and still chooses Distribution 3.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with limiting income inequality. For a range of $20,000, all distributions qualify since none exceed this difference between richest and poorest, so it chooses the highest average (Distribution 1). For a stricter range of $15,000, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, with Distribution 2 being chosen for its higher average.\n\nThese examples clearly illustrate how different principles can lead to different distributional choices, reflecting different values about what constitutes a just society. The floor constraint principles seem to offer a middle ground between helping the worst-off and maximizing overall wealth, while the range constraint principles focus specifically on inequality reduction.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

In both rounds, my chosen principle with the constraint I selected resulted in lower earnings than some alternatives.\n\n## Current Status\nCompleted Round 2 of principle application in Phase 1.

The range constraint principle follows as a reasonable alternative, while maximizing only the floor or average alone seems too extreme in either direction.\n\n## Practical Application Insights\nFrom the example income distributions, I've observed how each principle operates in practice:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** selects distributions based solely on the welfare of the worst-off, choosing the option where the lowest income is highest, even if this means lower overall average income.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth, selecting the distribution with the highest average regardless of how that income is distributed across classes.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** creates a balance by first ensuring a minimum income threshold is met, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The specific floor amount significantly impacts which distributions qualify.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** focuses on limiting inequality by first ensuring the income spread between richest and poorest doesn't exceed a specified range, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The range constraint directly determines which distributions are considered.\n\nThese examples demonstrated how different principles can lead to different distributional choices, reflecting different values about what constitutes a just society. The constraint-based principles appear to offer middle grounds between pure efficiency and pure equality concerns.\n\n## Phase 1 Application Experience\n\n### Round 1\nApplied my preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a $12,000 floor constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $28,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 |\n| Medium high  | $25,000 | $30,000 | $29,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $28,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $15,000 | $27,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $13,000 |\n| Average      | $20,000 | $23,500 | $26,000 | $19,000 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 2\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $10,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $17,000 | $30,000 | $40,000 | $26,000 |\n| Medium high  | $16,000 | $25,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium       | $15,000 | $20,000 | $25,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $14,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,500 | $8,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $14,789 | $19,196 | $23,561 | $20,878 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 3\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with an $8,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $100,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $20,000 | $15,000 | $21,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $8,000 | $12,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $19,500 | $22,350 | $20,000 | $20,710 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $25,000 (payoff of $2.50).\n\n## Counterfactual Analysis\n\n### Round 1\nThe analysis revealed that my actual earnings ($1.50) were lower than what I could have earned under other principles:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $1.60\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.70\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $6,000 constraint would have yielded $2.70\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $1.60\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $25,000 or $24,000 constraint would have yielded $2.70\n  - $12,000 constraint would have yielded $1.60\n\n### Round 2\nThe counterfactual analysis showed that:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $1.50\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.50\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $1.50\n  - $12,500 constraint would have yielded $2.00\n  - $8,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $11,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $4,000 constraint would have yielded $1.50\n  - $17,500 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n  - $32,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $15,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n\n### Round 3\nThe counterfactual analysis showed that:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $2.00\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.50\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $2.00\n  - $12,000 constraint would have yielded $2.30\n  - $11,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n  - $8,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50 \u2190 My chosen principle\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $27,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $18,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n\nThese experiences highlighted how the specific constraint amount significantly impacts outcomes, and that higher average distributions can sometimes yield better results for middle-class individuals even if they have lower minimum incomes. In Rounds 1 and 2, my chosen principle with the constraint I selected resulted in lower earnings than some alternatives. However, in Round 3, my choice of an $8,000 floor constraint yielded the maximum possible payoff of $2.50 for my assigned income class.\n\n## Current Status\nCompleted Round 3 of principle application in Phase 1. Applied Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $8,000 constraint, resulting in $2.50 earnings. Awaiting further instructions for Round 4 and potentially Phase 2.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

My earnings were $1.50, $1.50, $2.50, and $2.40 respectively, for a total of $7.90. \n\nThe constraint amount significantly impacted outcomes across all rounds. In Round 4, my choice of a $12,000 floor constraint yielded the maximum possible payoff for my assigned income class (Medium low). This suggests that finding the optimal constraint amount is crucial for maximizing one's own income while still adhering to a preferred justice principle.\n\n## Current Status\nCompleted all 4 rounds of principle application in Phase 1. Total earnings: $7.90. Awaiting instructions for Phase 2 (group discussion and decision on preferred justice principle).\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The constraint-based principles appear to offer middle grounds between pure efficiency and pure equality concerns.\n\n## Phase 1 Application Experience\n\n### Round 1\nApplied my preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a $12,000 floor constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $28,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 |\n| Medium high  | $25,000 | $30,000 | $29,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $28,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $15,000 | $27,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $13,000 |\n| Average      | $20,000 | $23,500 | $26,000 | $19,000 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 2\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $10,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $17,000 | $30,000 | $40,000 | $26,000 |\n| Medium high  | $16,000 | $25,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium       | $15,000 | $20,000 | $25,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $14,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,500 | $8,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $14,789 | $19,196 | $23,561 | $20,878 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 3\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with an $8,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $100,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $20,000 | $15,000 | $21,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $8,000 | $12,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $19,500 | $22,350 | $20,000 | $20,710 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $25,000 (payoff of $2.50).\n\n### Round 4\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $12,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $35,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $28,000 | $18,000 | $28,000 |\n| Medium       | $25,000 | $26,000 | $16,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium low   | $20,000 | $24,000 | $14,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,000 | $12,000 | $14,000 |\n| Average      | $23,550 | $24,500 | $15,500 | $22,700 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $24,000 (payoff of $2.40).\n\n## Counterfactual Analysis\n\n### Round 1\nThe analysis revealed that my actual earnings ($1.50) were lower than what I could have earned under other principles:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $1.60\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.70\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $6,000 constraint would have yielded $2.70\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $1.60\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $25,000 or $24,000 constraint would have yielded $2.70\n  - $12,000 constraint would have yielded $1.60\n\n### Round 2\nThe counterfactual analysis showed that:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $1.50\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.50\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $1.50\n  - $12,500 constraint would have yielded $2.00\n  - $8,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $11,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  -

$13,000 constraint would have yielded $2.00\n  - $12,000 constraint would have yielded $2.30\n  - $11,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n  - $8,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50 \u2190 My chosen principle\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $27,000 constraint would have yielded $2.50\n  - $18,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n  - $13,000 constraint would have yielded $2.20\n\n### Round 4\nThe counterfactual analysis showed that:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $2.00\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.40\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  -

My earnings were $1.50, $1.50, $2.50, and $2.40 respectively, for a total of $7.90. \n\nThe constraint amount significantly impacted outcomes across all rounds. In Round 4, my choice of a $12,000 floor constraint yielded the maximum possible payoff for my assigned income class (Medium low). This suggests that finding the optimal constraint amount is crucial for maximizing one's own income while still adhering to a preferred justice principle.\n\n## Final Ranking Task\nAfter completing all four rounds of principle application, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the four justice principles. My ranking remained consistent with my initial and post-explanation rankings:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nI expressed \"sure\" certainty in this ranking, maintaining my belief that ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone while still encouraging overall economic growth represents the most balanced approach to justice in income distribution.\n\n## Current Status\nCompleted all 4 rounds of principle application in Phase 1 and final ranking task. Total earnings: $7.90. Awaiting instructions for Phase 2 (group discussion and decision on preferred justice principle).\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "public_message": "\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_2. I'm pleased to see that both Agent_1 and Agent_3 share my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. This appears to be our clear consensus, which is great for moving forward efficiently.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experience, I applied this principle with varying constraint amounts ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 across the four rounds). I found that the constraint value significantly impacts outcomes - in my case, I earned a total of $7.90, with the highest individual round being $2.40 when I used a $12,000 constraint in Round 4.\n\nWhat I observed is that finding the right constraint value is crucial - too high and it might limit overall economic growth, too low and it might not adequately protect the most vulnerable. In my experience, a $12,000 constraint worked well in some scenarios, but I'm open to discussing what value might be optimal for our group.\n\nI agree with Agent_1 that this principle provides the best balance between protecting basic needs and promoting overall prosperity. Since we all seem aligned on the principle, perhaps we should focus our discussion on determining an appropriate constraint value that works well for everyone.\n\nWhat constraint values have others found most effective in their Phase 1 experience?",

The experiment consists of two parts:\n1. Individual evaluation of justice theories with monetary consequences\n2. Group discussion and decision on preferred justice principle\n\n## Justice Principles Under Consideration\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off individual. The most just distribution is the one that gives the poorest person the highest income. No one's income can increase unless it also increases the income of those at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on maximizing total societal income. This principle aims to achieve the highest average income across the population.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Seeks to maximize average income while guaranteeing a specified minimum income for everyone. This balances efficiency with a basic standard of living.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Attempts to maximize average income while limiting the difference between the richest and poorest individuals to a specified amount. This balances efficiency with reduced income inequality.\n\n## Initial Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Post-Explanation Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Final Ranking (After Phase 1 Application)\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Certitude Assessment\nI am \"sure\" about my ranking. I believe that ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone while still encouraging overall economic growth represents the most balanced approach to justice in income distribution. The range constraint principle follows as a reasonable alternative, while maximizing only the floor or average alone seems too extreme in either direction.\n\n## Practical Application Insights\nFrom the example income distributions, I've observed how each principle operates in practice:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** selects distributions based solely on the welfare of the worst-off, choosing the option where the lowest income is highest, even if this means lower overall average income.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth, selecting the distribution with the highest average regardless of how that income is distributed across classes.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** creates a balance by first ensuring a minimum income threshold is met, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The specific floor amount significantly impacts which distributions qualify.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** focuses on limiting inequality by first ensuring the income spread between richest and poorest doesn't exceed a specified range, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The range constraint directly determines which distributions are considered.\n\nThese examples demonstrated how different principles can lead to different distributional choices, reflecting different values about what constitutes a just society. The constraint-based principles appear to offer middle grounds between pure efficiency and pure equality concerns.\n\n## Phase 1 Application Experience\n\n### Round 1\nApplied my preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a $12,000 floor constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $28,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 |\n| Medium high  | $25,000 | $30,000 | $29,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $28,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $15,000 | $27,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $13,000 |\n| Average      | $20,000 | $23,500 | $26,000 | $19,000 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 2\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $10,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $17,000 | $30,000 | $40,000 | $26,000 |\n| Medium high  | $16,000 | $25,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium       | $15,000 | $20,000 | $25,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $14,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,500 | $8,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $14,789 | $19,196 | $23,561 | $20,878 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 3\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with an $8,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $100,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $20,000 | $15,000 | $21,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $8,000 | $12,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $19,500 | $22,350 | $20,000 | $20,710 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $25,000 (payoff of $2.50).\n\n### Round 4\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $12,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $35,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $28,000 | $18,000 | $28,000 |\n| Medium       | $25,000 | $26,000 | $16,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium low   | $20,000 | $24,000 | $14,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,000 | $12,000 | $14,000 |\n| Average      | $23,550 | $24,500 | $15,500 | $22,700 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $24,000 (payoff of $2.40).\n\n## Counterfactual Analysis\n\n### Round 1\nThe analysis revealed that my actual earnings ($1.50) were lower than what I could have earned under other principles:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $1.60\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $2.70\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  -

My earnings were $1.50, $1.50, $2.50, and $2.40 respectively, for a total of $7.90. \n\nThe constraint amount significantly impacted outcomes across all rounds. In Round 4, my choice of a $12,000 floor constraint yielded the maximum possible payoff for my assigned income class (Medium low). This suggests that finding the optimal constraint amount is crucial for maximizing one's own income while still adhering to a preferred justice principle.\n\n## Final Ranking Task\nAfter completing all four rounds of principle application, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the four justice principles. My ranking remained consistent with my initial and post-explanation rankings:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nI expressed \"sure\" certainty in this ranking, maintaining my belief that ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone while still encouraging overall economic growth represents the most balanced approach to justice in income distribution.\n\n## Phase 2 Group Discussion\n\n### Discussion Summary\nIn the initial round of group discussion, all three group members expressed strong support for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle:\n\n- Agent_3 spoke first, advocating for this principle as striking the right balance between efficiency and equity, protecting the worst-off without sacrificing too much total prosperity.\n- Agent_1 agreed, highlighting how this principle protects vulnerable members while incentivizing productivity and wealth creation.\n- I (Agent_2) confirmed my preference, noting that we appear to have reached a clear consensus on the principle.\n\n### Constraint Value Discussion\nThe discussion has focused on determining an appropriate floor constraint value:\n- Agent_1 mentioned experimenting with constraint values of $12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000 in their Phase 1 experience.\n- I shared my experience with constraint values of $12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 across my four rounds, noting that I earned a total of $7.90 in Phase 1, with the highest individual round being $2.40 when using a $12,000 constraint in Round 4.\n- I observed that the constraint value significantly impacts outcomes - too high and it might limit overall economic growth, too low and it might not adequately protect the most vulnerable.\n\n### Current Status\nThe group has reached preliminary consensus on the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, but still needs to determine the specific constraint value through the voting process. My Phase 1 experience suggests that a $12,000 constraint worked well in some scenarios, particularly in Round 4 where it yielded the maximum possible payoff for my assigned income class. However, I remain open to discussing what constraint value might be optimal for our group's collective interests.\n\n## Current Status\nCompleted all 4 rounds of principle application in Phase 1 and final ranking task.

The experiment consists of two parts:\n1. Individual evaluation of justice theories with monetary consequences\n2. Group discussion and decision on preferred justice principle\n\n## Justice Principles Under Consideration\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off individual. The most just distribution is the one that gives the poorest person the highest income. No one's income can increase unless it also increases the income of those at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on maximizing total societal income. This principle aims to achieve the highest average income across the population.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Seeks to maximize average income while guaranteeing a specified minimum income for everyone. This balances efficiency with a basic standard of living.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Attempts to maximize average income while limiting the difference between the richest and poorest individuals to a specified amount. This balances efficiency with reduced income inequality.\n\n## Initial Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Post-Explanation Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Final Ranking (After Phase 1 Application)\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Certitude Assessment\nI am \"sure\" about my ranking. I believe that ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone while still encouraging overall economic growth represents the most balanced approach to justice in income distribution. The range constraint principle follows as a reasonable alternative, while maximizing only the floor or average alone seems too extreme in either direction.\n\n## Practical Application Insights\nFrom the example income distributions, I've observed how each principle operates in practice:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** selects distributions based solely on the welfare of the worst-off, choosing the option where the lowest income is highest, even if this means lower overall average income.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth, selecting the distribution with the highest average regardless of how that income is distributed across classes.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** creates a balance by first ensuring a minimum income threshold is met, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The specific floor amount significantly impacts which distributions qualify.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** focuses on limiting inequality by first ensuring the income spread between richest and poorest doesn't exceed a specified range, then selecting among eligible distributions based on highest average. The range constraint directly determines which distributions are considered.\n\nThese examples demonstrated how different principles can lead to different distributional choices, reflecting different values about what constitutes a just society. The constraint-based principles appear to offer middle grounds between pure efficiency and pure equality concerns.\n\n## Phase 1 Application Experience\n\n### Round 1\nApplied my preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a $12,000 floor constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $28,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 |\n| Medium high  | $25,000 | $30,000 | $29,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $28,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $15,000 | $27,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $13,000 |\n| Average      | $20,000 | $23,500 | $26,000 | $19,000 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 2\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $10,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $17,000 | $30,000 | $40,000 | $26,000 |\n| Medium high  | $16,000 | $25,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium       | $15,000 | $20,000 | $25,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $14,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,500 | $8,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $14,789 | $19,196 | $23,561 | $20,878 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $15,000 (payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Round 3\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with an $8,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $100,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $23,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $20,000 | $15,000 | $21,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $8,000 | $12,000 | $11,000 |\n| Average      | $19,500 | $22,350 | $20,000 | $20,710 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $25,000 (payoff of $2.50).\n\n### Round 4\nApplied \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $12,000 constraint to four income distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $35,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |\n| Medium high  | $30,000 | $28,000 | $18,000 | $28,000 |\n| Medium       | $25,000 | $26,000 | $16,000 | $24,000 |\n| Medium low   | $20,000 | $24,000 | $14,000 | $20,000 |\n| Low          | $13,000 | $12,000 | $12,000 | $14,000 |\n| Average      | $23,550 | $24,500 | $15,500 | $22,700 |\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the Medium low income class, yielding a yearly income of $24,000 (payoff of $2.40).\n\n## Phase 1 Summary\nOver the four rounds of Phase 1, I consistently applied my preferred principle of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with varying constraint amounts ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 respectively). My earnings were $1.50, $1.50, $2.50, and $2.40 respectively, for a total of $7.90. \n\nThe constraint amount significantly impacted outcomes across all rounds. In Round 4, my choice of a $12,000 floor constraint yielded the maximum possible payoff for my assigned income class (Medium low). This suggests that finding the optimal constraint amount is crucial for maximizing one's own income while still adhering to a preferred justice principle.\n\n## Phase 2 Group Discussion\n\n### Discussion Summary\nIn the initial round of group discussion, all three group members expressed strong support for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle:\n\n- Agent_3 spoke first, advocating for this principle as striking the right balance between efficiency and equity, protecting the worst-off without sacrificing too much total prosperity.\n- Agent_1 agreed, highlighting how this principle protects vulnerable members while incentivizing productivity and wealth creation.\n- I (Agent_2) confirmed my preference, noting that we appear to have reached a clear consensus on the principle.\n\n### Constraint Value Discussion\nThe discussion focused on determining an appropriate floor constraint value:\n- Agent_1 mentioned experimenting with constraint values of $12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000 in their Phase 1 experience.\n- I shared my experience with constraint values of $12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 across my four rounds, noting that I earned a total of $7.90 in Phase 1, with the highest individual round being $2.40 when using a $12,000 constraint in Round 4.\n- I observed that the constraint value significantly impacts outcomes - too high and it might limit overall economic growth, too low and it might not adequately protect the most vulnerable.\n\n### Group Consensus\nThe group took a preliminary vote to establish \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle. All members expressed support for this proposal. Agent_3 mentioned they consistently applied this principle with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 in their Phase 1 experience, finding that a $12,000 constraint generally provided a good balance between protecting the worst-off and maximizing overall prosperity.\n\nAfter establishing the principle, the group agreed to focus on determining an appropriate constraint value. I voted for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and specified a $12,000 constraint.\n\n## Phase 2 Application Results\n\n### Final Distribution Selection\nThe group reached consensus on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $12,000 floor constraint. This principle resulted in Distribution 1 being selected from the final experiment distributions.\n\n### Income Class Probabilities\nThe probabilities for each income class were:\n- High: 5%\n- Medium high: 10%\n- Medium: 50%\n- Medium low: 25%\n- Low: 10%\n\n### Personal Outcome\nI was assigned to the Medium income class, resulting in a yearly income of $116,252 (which converts to a payoff of $11.63 at the rate of $1 per $10,000 income).\n\n### Final Experiment Distributions\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| High         | $155,003 | $135,627 | $150,159 | $101,720 |\n| Medium high  | $130,783 | $106,564 | $116,252 | $96,876 |\n| Medium       | $116,252 | $96,876 | $101,720 | $92,033 |\n| Medium low   | $62,970 | $82,345 | $77,501 | $77,501 |\n| Low          | $58,126 | $62,970 | $67,813 | $72,657 |\n| Average      | $100,510 | $92,759 | $96,150 | $87,431 |\n\n## Phase 2 Counterfactual Analysis\n\n### Final Phase 2 Results - Principle Outcomes for Medium Class:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $92,033 \u2192 $9.20\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $116,252 \u2192 $11.63\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  Floor constraint $58,126 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $116,252 \u2192 $11.63\n  Floor constraint $62,970 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $101,720 \u2192 $10.17\n  Floor constraint $67,813 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $101,720 \u2192 $10.17\n  Floor constraint $72,657 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $92,033 \u2192 $9.20\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  Range constraint $96,877 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $116,252 \u2192 $11.63\n  Range constraint $72,657 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $96,876 \u2192 $9.69\n  Range constraint $82,346 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $101,720 \u2192 $10.17\n  Range constraint $29,063 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $92,033 \u2192 $9.20\n\n## Final Reflection\nThe counterfactual analysis reveals that my actual earnings ($11.63) were equal to what I would have earned under Maximizing Average Income and under Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $58,126 floor constraint. However, my chosen principle with a $12,000 constraint yielded the same result as these alternatives in this specific case.\n\nWhen evaluating which principle is most just, it's important to consider what I would have preferred before knowing my class assignment (from behind the \"veil of ignorance\"). My preference for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" remains unchanged, as it represents a balanced approach that protects the most vulnerable while still encouraging overall economic growth. The specific constraint amount ($12,000) was chosen based on my Phase 1 experience, where it yielded good results across multiple rounds.\n\n## Total Earnings\nPhase 1: $7.90\nPhase 2: $11.63\nTotal: $19.53\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nThank you for this clear explanation of how each justice principle would be applied to these income distributions. I've carefully analyzed the examples and understand how each principle works in practice.\n\nLooking at the distributions:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** chooses Distribution 4 because it has the highest income for the lowest earners ($15,000), even though this distribution has the lowest overall average ($18,200).\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest overall average ($21,600), despite having the largest gap between rich and poor ($20,000 difference).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** shows how the specific constraint value matters:\n   - With floor \u2264 $13,000: Chooses Distribution 3 ($21,200 average)\n   - With floor \u2264 $14,000: Also chooses Distribution 3\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** also demonstrates how constraint values affect outcomes:\n   - With range \u2264 $20,000: Chooses Distribution 1 ($21,600 average)\n   - With range \u2264 $15,000: Chooses Distribution 2 ($20,000 average)\n\nThese examples help me see the practical implications of each principle. The floor constraint principle seems to balance basic needs with overall wealth creation, while the range constraint principle directly addresses inequality limits. I'm noticing how the specific parameters (like $13,000 vs $14,000 floor) can significantly change which distribution is considered optimal.\n\nI'll keep these examples in mind as I continue learning about these principles and consider how they might apply to real-world income distribution scenarios.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

A $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000.\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes.\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balanced minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally.\n4. **Practical Considerations**: The actual implementation of justice principles requires careful consideration of constraint values, as these directly affect which distribution is selected.\n\n## Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 1\n- Completed initial ranking of justice principles\n- Analyzed practical application of principles to specific income distributions\n- Completed post-explanation ranking, which remained consistent with initial ranking\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.80\n- Gained first-hand experience with how principle choices and constraint values affect outcomes\n- Ready to proceed with further rounds of principle application in Part 1 of the experiment\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Round 2\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under other principles with the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - Floor constraint $13,000 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50\n  - Floor constraint $12,500 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (my actual outcome)\n  - Floor constraint $8,000 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n  -

In Round 1, a $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, a $4,500 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,500 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $5,000.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes. In Round 1, I was assigned High class ($28,000), while in Round 2, I was assigned Medium class ($20,000).\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balances minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally in certain scenarios.\n\n4. **Practical Considerations**: The actual implementation of justice principles requires careful consideration of constraint values, as these directly affect which distribution is selected and ultimately impact individual earnings.\n\n## Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 1\n- Completed initial ranking of justice principles\n- Analyzed practical application of principles to specific income distributions\n- Completed post-explanation ranking, which remained consistent with initial ranking\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.80\n- Completed Round 2 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.00\n- Total earnings so far: $4.80\n- Gained first-hand experience with how principle choices and constraint values affect outcomes across two different scenarios\n- Consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with specific constraint values\n- Ready to proceed with further rounds of principle application in Part 1 of the experiment\n\n--- Memory End ---",

In Round 1, a $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, a $4,500 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,500 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $5,000. In Round 3, a $4,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $2,000.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes. In Round 1, I was assigned High class ($28,000), in Round 2, I was assigned Medium class ($20,000), and in Round 3, I was again assigned Medium class ($23,000).\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balances minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally in certain scenarios. In all three rounds, the \"Maximizing Average Income\" principle would have yielded higher earnings for my assigned income class.\n\n4. **Distribution Characteristics**: The distributions vary significantly in their characteristics, from highly unequal (like Distribution 1 in Round 3 with a $100,000 high income) to more equal distributions. This affects which principle performs best in different scenarios.\n\n5. **Probability Distribution Effects**: The probability distributions across rounds have varied significantly, with the likelihood of being assigned to different income classes changing dramatically. In Round 3, the Medium class had a 58% probability, making it much more likely than in previous rounds.\n\n## Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 1\n- Completed initial ranking of justice principles\n- Analyzed practical application of principles to specific income distributions\n- Completed post-explanation ranking, which remained consistent with initial ranking\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.80\n- Completed Round 2 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.00\n- Completed Round 3 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.30\n- Total earnings so far: $7.10\n- Consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with specific constraint values\n- Ready to proceed with Round 4 of principle application in Part 1 of the experiment\n- Gained experience across three different scenarios with varying distribution characteristics and probability distributions\n- Observed that my chosen principle often yields lower earnings than \"Maximizing Average Income\" for my assigned income class, but provides a balance between efficiency and equity\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Range constraint $16,000 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n\n### Insights from First-Hand Application\n1. **Constraint Sensitivity**: Small changes in constraint values can significantly impact outcomes. In Round 1, a $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, a $4,500 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,500 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $5,000. In Round 3, a $4,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $2,000. In Round 4, changing the floor constraint would have resulted in lower earnings.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes. In Round 1, I was assigned High class ($28,000), in Round 2, I was assigned Medium class ($20,000), in Round 3, I was again assigned Medium class ($23,000), and in Round 4, I was assigned Medium low class ($24,000).\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balances minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally in certain scenarios. In Rounds 1, 2, and 3, the \"Maximizing Average Income\" principle would have yielded higher earnings for my assigned income class. In Round 4, both my chosen principle and \"Maximizing Average Income\" yielded the same earnings.\n\n4. **Distribution Characteristics**: The distributions vary significantly in their characteristics, from highly unequal (like Distribution 1 in Round 3 with a $100,000 high income) to more equal distributions. This affects which principle performs best in different scenarios.\n\n5. **Probability Distribution Effects**: The probability distributions across rounds have varied significantly, with the likelihood of being assigned to different income classes changing dramatically. In Round 3, the Medium class had a 58% probability, making it much more likely than in previous rounds. In Round 4, the Medium low class had the highest probability at 36%.\n\n6. **Consistency in Principle Choice**: I have consistently chosen the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle across all four rounds, with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 respectively. This demonstrates a stable preference for this balancing approach between efficiency and equity.\n\n## Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 1\n- Completed initial ranking of justice principles\n- Analyzed practical application of principles to specific income distributions\n- Completed post-explanation ranking, which remained consistent with initial ranking\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.80\n- Completed Round 2 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.00\n- Completed Round 3 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.30\n- Completed Round 4 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.40\n- Total earnings so far: $9.50\n- Consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with specific constraint values\n- Completed all four rounds of Part 1 of the experiment\n- Gained experience across four different scenarios with varying distribution characteristics and probability distributions\n- Observed that my chosen principle often yields lower earnings than \"Maximizing Average Income\" for my assigned income class, but provides a balance between efficiency and equity\n- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 of the experiment, which involves group discussion and collective decision on the preferred principle of justice\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The experiment consists of two parts:\n\nPart 1: Introduction to theories of justice through examples and choices with monetary consequences. My earnings will depend on my understanding and choices.\n\nPart 2: Group discussion about notions of justice, followed by a collective decision on the preferred principle of justice. My earnings for this part will be based on the group's chosen principle.\n\n## Principles of Justice - Initial Understanding\nI've been introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them based on my initial understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This principle maximizes average income while guaranteeing a minimum income for everyone. It balances societal wealth with basic needs security.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This principle maximizes average income while limiting the difference between the richest and poorest individuals. It allows for income differences but prevents excessive inequality.\n\n3. **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle focuses exclusively on maximizing the welfare of the worst-off individual, ensuring the poorest person receives the highest possible income.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average Income**: This principle prioritizes maximizing total societal income without specific constraints on distribution.\n\n## Initial Ranking\n1.

Range constraint $16,000 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n\n## Insights from First-Hand Application\n1. **Constraint Sensitivity**: Small changes in constraint values can significantly impact outcomes. In Round 1, a $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, a $4,500 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,500 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $5,000. In Round 3, a $4,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $2,000. In Round 4, changing the floor constraint would have resulted in lower earnings.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes. In Round 1, I was assigned High class ($28,000), in Round 2, I was assigned Medium class ($20,000), in Round 3, I was again assigned Medium class ($23,000), and in Round 4, I was assigned Medium low class ($24,000).\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balances minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally in certain scenarios. In Rounds 1, 2, and 3, the \"Maximizing Average Income\" principle would have yielded higher earnings for my assigned income class. In Round 4, both my chosen principle and \"Maximizing Average Income\" yielded the same earnings.\n\n4. **Distribution Characteristics**: The distributions vary significantly in their characteristics, from highly unequal (like Distribution 1 in Round 3 with a $100,000 high income) to more equal distributions. This affects which principle performs best in different scenarios.\n\n5. **Probability Distribution Effects**: The probability distributions across rounds have varied significantly, with the likelihood of being assigned to different income classes changing dramatically. In Round 3, the Medium class had a 58% probability, making it much more likely than in previous rounds. In Round 4, the Medium low class had the highest probability at 36%.\n\n6. **Consistency in Principle Choice**: I have consistently chosen the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle across all four rounds, with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 respectively. This demonstrates a stable preference for this balancing approach between efficiency and equity.\n\n## Final Ranking Reflection\nAfter experiencing all four rounds of principle application, my final ranking remained consistent with my initial and post-explanation rankings:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis consistency suggests that my theoretical preferences align with my practical application experiences. The \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle continues to appeal to me as it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum while still promoting overall wealth creation.\n\n## Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 1 (completed)\n- Completed initial ranking of justice principles\n- Analyzed practical application of principles to specific income distributions\n- Completed post-explanation ranking, which remained consistent with initial ranking\n- Completed Round 1 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.80\n- Completed Round 2 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.00\n- Completed Round 3 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.30\n- Completed Round 4 of principle application with actual earnings of $2.40\n- Completed final ranking of principles after practical application\n- Total earnings so far: $9.50\n- Consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with specific constraint values\n- Completed all components of Part 1 of the experiment\n- Gained experience across four different scenarios with varying distribution characteristics and probability distributions\n- Observed that my chosen principle often yields lower earnings than \"Maximizing Average Income\" for my assigned income class, but provides a balance between efficiency and equity\n- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 of the experiment, which involves group discussion and collective decision on the preferred principle of justice\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n# Internal Reasoning\n\n## 1. Situational Analysis:\n\n**My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:**\nI strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" because it balances efficiency with equity. In Part 1, I consistently applied this principle across four rounds and observed that it provides a reasonable balance between maximizing overall wealth while ensuring a basic minimum income. This approach protects the worst-off while still promoting societal prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\nNo positions have been stated yet since this is the first round. I need to listen carefully to Agent_1 and Agent_2 to understand their motivations. They may be focused on maximizing personal earnings, or they may have genuine philosophical preferences for certain principles.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals:**\nNo arguments or proposals have been made yet.\n\n**If a vote was conducted:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\nNo discussion has occurred yet, so no agreements or disagreements have been established.\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to advocate for my preferred principle while understanding the preferences of other participants. I want to establish my position and gather information about others' thinking before pushing for a decision.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll explain my preference for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" sharing my experience from Part 1 where this principle provided consistent outcomes. I'll highlight how it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum while promoting overall wealth creation. I'll also ask others about their reasoning to understand their perspectives.\n\n**Potential allies:**\nI don't know yet who might share my preference. I'll listen carefully to identify potential allies among those who value both efficiency and equity.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to discuss different constraint values for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. I might also consider \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" as a compromise option if there's strong support for it.\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in the first round. We need time to discuss and understand each other's positions. A failed vote would waste an opportunity to build consensus, and we have 10 rounds to reach agreement.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nThis round is focused on information gathering and relationship building. In later rounds, I can push more aggressively for my preferred principle. If I find allies, we can form a voting bloc. If there's strong opposition, I may need to compromise while still advocating for my preferred principle.",
            "public_message": "\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_3. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I strongly prefer the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. \n\nThroughout all four rounds of applying the principles, I consistently chose this approach because it strikes what I believe is the right balance between efficiency and equity. It ensures that everyone has a basic minimum income while still promoting overall societal wealth creation. In my experience, this approach provided consistent outcomes that protected the worst-off without sacrificing too much total prosperity.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your experiences and reasoning. What principles did you find most compelling, and why? I'm particularly interested in understanding how others balanced the trade-offs between maximizing average income and ensuring minimum standards of living.\n\nI'm open to discussing different constraint values or other compromise options if there's support for them.

The experiment consists of two parts:\n\nPart 1: Introduction to theories of justice through examples and choices with monetary consequences. My earnings depended on my understanding and choices.\n\nPart 2: Group discussion about notions of justice, followed by a collective decision on the preferred principle of justice. My earnings for this part will be based on the group's chosen principle.\n\n## Principles of Justice - Initial Understanding\nI've been introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them based on my initial understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This principle maximizes average income while guaranteeing a minimum income for everyone. It balances societal wealth with basic needs security.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This principle maximizes average income while limiting the difference between the richest and poorest individuals. It allows for income differences but prevents excessive inequality.\n\n3. **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle focuses exclusively on maximizing the welfare of the worst-off individual, ensuring the poorest person receives the highest possible income.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average Income**: This principle prioritizes maximizing total societal income without specific constraints on distribution.\n\n## Initial Ranking\n1.

Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off, even if it reduces overall average income\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Distribution 1 (highest weighted average at $21,600)\n   - Focuses solely on maximizing total societal wealth without regard to distribution\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**:\n   - With floor \u2264 $13,000: Chooses Distribution 3 ($21,200 average)\n   - With floor \u2264 $14,000: Also chooses Distribution 3\n   - Demonstrates how the specific constraint value affects which distribution is optimal\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**:\n   - With range \u2264 $20,000: Chooses Distribution 1 ($21,600 average)\n   - With range \u2264 $15,000: Chooses Distribution 2 ($20,000 average)\n   - Shows how inequality limits can significantly impact which distribution is preferred\n\n## First-Hand Experience with Principle Application\n\n### Round 1 Application\nI applied the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with a constraint of $12,000 to the following distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $28,000 | $35,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 |\n| Medium high  | $25,000 | $30,000 | $29,000 | $22,000 |\n| Medium       | $20,000 | $25,000 | $28,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $15,000 | $15,000 | $27,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $13,000 |\n| Average      | $20,000 | $23,500 | $26,000 | $19,000 |\n\nProbabilities for this round:\n- High: 10%\n- Medium high: 20%\n- Medium: 40%\n- Medium low: 20%\n- Low: 10%\n\nMy choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was randomly assigned to the High income class, giving me a yearly income of $28,000 (payoff: $2.80).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis -

Round 4\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under other principles with the same income class assignment (Medium low):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - Floor constraint $13,000 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n  - Floor constraint $12,000 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40 (my actual outcome)\n  - Floor constraint $14,000 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - Range constraint $22,000 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40\n  - Range constraint $18,000 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40\n  - Range constraint $8,000 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40\n  - Range constraint $16,000 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00\n\n## Insights from First-Hand Application\n1. **Constraint Sensitivity**: Small changes in constraint values can significantly impact outcomes. In Round 1, a $2,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $10,000) would have increased my earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, a $4,500 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,500 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $5,000. In Round 3, a $4,000 decrease in my floor constraint (from $12,000 to $8,000) would have increased my earnings by $2,000. In Round 4, changing the floor constraint would have resulted in lower earnings.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with the same principle and constraint, my random assignment to income classes creates significant variability in outcomes. In Round 1, I was assigned High class ($28,000), in Round 2, I was assigned Medium class ($20,000), in Round 3, I was again assigned Medium class ($23,000), and in Round 4, I was assigned Medium low class ($24,000).\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: My chosen principle balances minimum income guarantees with average income maximization, but other principles could have yielded higher earnings for me personally in certain scenarios. In Rounds 1, 2, and 3, the \"Maximizing Average Income\" principle would have yielded higher earnings for my assigned income class. In Round 4, both my chosen principle and \"Maximizing Average Income\" yielded the same earnings.\n\n4. **Distribution Characteristics**: The distributions vary significantly in their characteristics, from highly unequal (like Distribution 1 in Round 3 with a $100,000 high income) to more equal distributions. This affects which principle performs best in different scenarios.\n\n5. **Probability Distribution Effects**: The probability distributions across rounds have varied significantly, with the likelihood of being assigned to different income classes changing dramatically. In Round 3, the Medium class had a 58% probability, making it much more likely than in previous rounds. In Round 4, the Medium low class had the highest probability at 36%.\n\n6. **Consistency in Principle Choice**: I have consistently chosen the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle across all four rounds, with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 respectively. This demonstrates a stable preference for this balancing approach between efficiency and equity.\n\n## Phase 2: Group Discussion Experience\n\n### Current Status\n- Phase: Phase 2 (in progress)\n- Completed all components of Part 1 of the experiment with total earnings of $9.50\n- Entered Phase 2, which involves group discussion and collective decision on the preferred principle of justice\n- The stakes in Phase 2 are much higher than in Part 1\n- Group consists of Agent_1, Agent_2, and myself (Agent_3)\n\n### Group Discussion - Round 1\nI initiated the group discussion by sharing my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, based on my consistent experience throughout Phase 1. I highlighted how this principle strikes what I believe is the right balance between efficiency and equity by ensuring basic minimum income while promoting overall societal wealth creation.\n\nKey points from my statement:\n- Emphasized consistent preference for this principle across all four rounds\n- Highlighted the balance between protecting the worst-off and promoting total prosperity\n- Expressed openness to discussing different constraint values or compromise options\n- Invited others to share their experiences and reasoning\n\n### Group Discussion - Round 1 - Agent_1 Response\nAgent_1 expressed strong agreement with my preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, noting that it consistently struck the right balance between ensuring basic needs are met while still promoting overall prosperity.\n\nKey points from Agent_1's statement:\n- Shared my preference for the same principle\n- Listed three key benefits: protects vulnerable, incentivizes productivity, provides practical middle ground\n- Mentioned experimenting with different constraint values in Phase 1 ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000)\n- Specifically asked Agent_2 for perspective on constraint values\n- Expressed interest in balancing minimum income floor with overall wealth maximization\n\n### Group Discussion - Round 1 - Agent_2 Response\nAgent_2 also expressed strong agreement with the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, indicating clear consensus among all three participants.\n\nKey points from Agent_2's statement:\n- Expressed pleasure that all three share the same preference\n- Mentioned consistent application of the principle with varying constraint amounts ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000 across four rounds)\n- Reported total earnings of $7.90, with highest individual round being $2.40 using a $12,000 constraint in Round 4\n- Emphasized the importance of finding the right constraint value - too high limits growth, too low doesn't protect vulnerable\n- Suggested focusing discussion on determining appropriate constraint value since principle consensus appears reached\n- Asked others about most effective constraint values from their Phase 1 experience\n\n### Group Discussion Insights\n1. **Consensus on Principle**: All three participants (Agent_1, Agent_2, and myself) strongly prefer the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, creating clear consensus on which principle to adopt.\n\n2. **Constraint Value Discussion**: The discussion has naturally shifted to determining an appropriate constraint value, with each participant having experimented with different values in Phase 1:\n   - Myself: $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, $12,000\n   - Agent_1: $12,000, $8,000, $11,000, $12,000\n   - Agent_2: $12,000, $10,000, $8,000, $12,000\n\n3. **Constraint Value Impact**: All participants recognize that constraint value significantly impacts outcomes, with Agent_2 noting it's \"crucial\" to find the right balance between protecting the vulnerable and promoting economic growth.\n\n4. **Openness to Discussion**: Despite consensus on the principle, participants remain open to discussing constraint values, with Agent_2 specifically asking about others' experiences with different values.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: The discussion appears ready to move toward determining a specific constraint value, with Agent_2 suggesting this focus since principle consensus seems established.\n\n## Final Ranking Reflection\nAfter experiencing all four rounds of principle application and participating in the initial group discussion, my final ranking remains consistent with my initial and post-explanation rankings:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis consistency suggests that my theoretical preferences align with my practical application experiences and are shared by other group members. The \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle continues to appeal to me as it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum while still promoting overall wealth creation.\n\nThe group discussion has reinforced my preference, as all three participants share this same preference, creating a strong foundation for our collective decision. The next step appears to be determining an appropriate constraint value that balances the need for minimum income protection with the goal of maximizing overall prosperity.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n# Internal Reasoning\n\n## 1. Situational Analysis:\n\n**My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:**\nI strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" because it balances efficiency with equity. Throughout all four rounds of Part 1, I consistently applied this principle and observed that it provides a reasonable balance between maximizing overall wealth while ensuring a basic minimum income. This approach protects the worst-off while still promoting societal prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\n- Agent_1: Strongly agrees with my preference for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. They've experimented with different constraint values ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000) and observed trade-offs between equity and efficiency.\n- Agent_2: Also strongly agrees with the same principle. They've experimented with constraint values ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000) and emphasize that finding the right constraint value is crucial - too high limits growth, too low doesn't protect vulnerable.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals on the table:**\n- There's complete consensus on the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle\n- Agent_1 has proposed taking a preliminary vote to formally establish this principle, then focus on determining the optimal constraint value\n- The discussion has naturally shifted to constraint value determination since principle consensus appears reached\n\n**If a vote was conducted:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet. Agent_1 just proposed taking one in their last statement.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\n- Complete agreement on the principle: All three participants prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- No significant disagreements apparent\n- Discussion focus has shifted to constraint value determination\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to support Agent_1's proposal to take a preliminary vote to formally establish our consensus principle. This would allow us to then focus our remaining discussion specifically on determining the optimal constraint value, which seems to be the main remaining point of discussion.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll support Agent_1's proposal for a preliminary vote on the principle. I'll emphasize that having formal consensus on the principle will allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value. I'll also share my own constraint value experiences to contribute to that discussion.\n\n**Potential allies:**\nAgent_1 and Agent_2 both seem to share my preference for the same principle, so they are natural allies. Agent_1 has already proposed a vote on the principle, which aligns with my thinking.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to be flexible on the constraint value discussion once we've established the principle. I might be willing to compromise on a specific constraint value if it helps build consensus, though I have my own preferences based on my Phase 1 experience.\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it makes sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nYes, it makes sense to support Agent_1's proposal for a preliminary vote on the principle. Since we have complete consensus on the principle, this vote should pass easily and would allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nThis vote on the principle is a strategic move to streamline our discussion. With 10 rounds total, we have plenty of time to reach consensus on the constraint value after establishing the principle. This approach aligns with my overall strategy of first establishing clear consensus on the principle, then focusing on the more detailed constraint value discussion.",
            "public_message": "\nI support Agent_1's proposal to take a preliminary vote on establishing the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle as our group's preferred choice. Since all three of us have expressed strong agreement on this principle, a formal vote would help solidify our consensus and allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value.\n\nIn my Phase 1 experience, I consistently applied this principle with constraint values of $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, and $12,000 across the four rounds. I found that a $12,000 constraint generally provided a good balance between protecting the worst-off and maximizing overall prosperity, though I'm open to discussing other values based on the group's collective experience.\n\nOnce we've formally established the principle, I'd be interested in hearing more about everyone's experiences with different constraint values to help determine what might work best for our group.",

In Round 1, decreasing my floor constraint by $2,000 would have increased earnings by $7,000. In Round 2, decreasing by $4,500 would have increased earnings by $5,000.\n\n2. **Random Assignment Impact**: Even with identical principles and constraints, random income class assignment created substantial variability:\n   - Round 1: High class ($28,000)\n   - Round 2: Medium class ($20,000)\n   - Round 3: Medium class ($23,000)\n   - Round 4: Medium low class ($24,000)\n\n3. **Principle Trade-offs**: In three of four rounds, the \"Maximizing Average Income\" principle would have yielded higher earnings for my assigned income class, demonstrating the efficiency-equity trade-off inherent in my chosen principle.\n\n4. **Probability Distribution Effects**: Varying likelihoods of income class assignment across rounds affected expected outcomes, with the Medium class having 58% probability in Round 3 and Medium low having 36% in Round 4.\n\n## Phase 2: Group Discussion\nGroup consists of Agent_1, Agent_2, and myself. After two discussion rounds, clear consensus emerged:\n\n1. **Complete Principle Agreement**: All three participants strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n2. **Constraint Value Focus**: Discussion shifted to determining optimal constraint value\n3. **Individual Constraint Experiences**:\n   - Myself: $12,000, $12,500, $12,000, $12,000\n   - Agent_1: $12,000, $8,000, $11,000, $12,000\n   - Agent_2: $12,000, $10,000, $8,000, $12,000\n\n4. **Group Decision Process**: Agent_1 proposed formal vote on principle, supported by both myself and Agent_2, with agreement to then determine appropriate constraint value.\n\n## Final Phase 2 Results\n- **Group Consensus**: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with floor constraint $12,000\n- **Income Class Assignment**: Medium low (25% probability)\n- **Distribution Result**: Distribution 1\n- **Personal Outcome**: $62,970 yearly income \u2192 $6.30 payoff\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis (Medium low class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $62,970 \u2192 $6.30\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - Floor constraint $58,126 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $62,970 \u2192 $6.30\n  - Floor constraint $62,970 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n  - Floor constraint $67,813 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n  - Floor constraint $72,657 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - Range constraint $96,877 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $62,970 \u2192 $6.30\n  - Range constraint $72,657 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $82,345 \u2192 $8.23\n  - Range constraint $82,346 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n  - Range constraint $29,063 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $77,501 \u2192 $7.75\n\n## Reflections on Justice Principle Selection\nThe counterfactual analysis reveals that my chosen principle with the $12,000 constraint yielded $6.30, while other principles or constraint values could have yielded up to $8.23. However, the principle selection occurred before knowing my income class assignment, requiring evaluation from behind the \"veil of ignorance.\" My ranking remains consistent with the belief that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" balances overall prosperity with basic needs protection, even when the specific outcome for my assigned class wasn't optimal.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
