We need to choose a principle that feels fair but also works in practice.\n\nLooking at the four options, I'm leaning towards Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. Here's why: it lets us maximize the overall wealth of society\u2014which means more resources for everyone\u2014but it also guarantees that no one falls below a basic minimum. It avoids the extreme poverty that can happen with pure average maximization, but it doesn't sacrifice as much total income as focusing only on the floor might.\n\nI know the exact floor amount matters, and I'm open to discussing what that should be. But the core idea\u2014protecting the worst-off while still growing the pie\u2014seems like a good balance to me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What principles are you each considering?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: I agree with Agent_2. Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach. It avoids the potential for extreme poverty that can happen if we only focus on the average, but it also doesn't sacrifice overall societal wealth as much as solely maximizing the floor might.\n\nFrom the first part of the experiment, I learned that the specific floor amount is really important. Setting it too high can eliminate distributions with much higher average incomes, which could end up costing everyone, including the lower income classes. Setting it too low might not provide enough protection. I think we should discuss what an appropriate floor level might be.\n\nAgent_1, what are your initial thoughts on the principles? Are you leaning towards any of them in particular?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: I agree with both of you that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is the best approach\u2014it balances fairness and efficiency by protecting the most vulnerable while still growing overall societal wealth. For the floor amount, I think $10,000 is a practical threshold. It\u2019s high enough to prevent extreme poverty but low enough to keep distributions with higher average incomes (like Distribution 2 from Phase 1, which had a $24,500 average and a minimum of $14,000) eligible. This ensures no one falls below a basic standard while preserving opportunities for higher overall prosperity. What do you both think about setting the floor at $10,000?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \"I'm really encouraged that we all seem to be converging on Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. It feels like we've found a principle that captures both efficiency and a basic moral concern for the worst-off.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal of a $10,000 floor seems very practical. I recall from Phase 1 that setting the floor too high could sometimes exclude distributions with significantly higher average incomes, which ultimately hurts everyone, including the lower classes. A $10,000 floor strikes me as a reasonable threshold that should prevent deep poverty while keeping our options open for greater overall prosperity. Agent_3, what's your take on the $10,000 figure?\n\nIf we're all comfortable with this\u2014the principle and the $10,000 floor\u2014we might be in a position to reach a consensus very quickly. This is great progress.\"\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \n\nAgent_2, I completely agree with your assessment\u2014$10,000 is a practical and effective floor amount. Just to clarify a common misunderstanding: the floor isn't the actual minimum income people receive; it's the threshold that distributions must meet. So with a $10,000 floor, Distribution 2 (minimum $14,000) would be selected, meaning the lowest anyone earns is $14,000, not $10,000. That's actually a stronger safety net than the floor amount itself! If we set the floor higher, say $13,000, we'd have to choose Distribution 1, which drops the average income to $14,000\u2014hurting everyone, including those in the lowest bracket. Based on Phase 1 data, $10,000 is the sweet spot: it guarantees a solid minimum while maximizing overall prosperity. Agent_3, what are your thoughts on this? Do you feel comfortable with $10,000 as the floor amount?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Agent_1, that's a really compelling point. Your example from Phase 1 makes the trade-off very clear. I was initially thinking about a slightly higher floor, but your analysis shows that a $10,000 floor successfully selected the distribution with the much higher average income while still ensuring the actual minimum income was a solid $14,000. You're right\u2014setting it higher would have forced us into a worse outcome for everyone.\n\nSo, I'm convinced. A $10,000 floor seems like the smart choice. It provides a meaningful safety net without unnecessarily sacrificing our potential collective prosperity.\n\nIt's great that we all agree on the principle and now seem to be converging on the $10,000 floor amount. This feels like a very strong consensus.\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \"It's fantastic to see such a strong and rapid consensus forming. We all agree on the principle of Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint, and after Agent_1's excellent clarification, we're also aligned on a $10,000 floor as the optimal parameter.\n\nTo recap our shared position: This principle ensures we maximize overall prosperity while guaranteeing that no distribution is chosen unless it provides at least a $10,000 income for the worst-off\u2014and as we saw, this often results in a much higher actual minimum for the poorest.\n\nSince we are in complete agreement, I propose we hold a vote this round to officially adopt this principle with the $10,000 floor. This would lock in our preferred outcome and allow us to conclude our discussion successfully. Does everyone agree to proceed with the vote?\"\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \n\nI fully support Agent_2's proposal to hold a vote. We've all clearly agreed on Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint with a $10,000 floor amount. The Phase 1 data confirms this is the optimal choice: it ensures a $14,000 minimum income (stronger than the floor itself) while maximizing average income at $24,500. A unanimous vote would solidify our consensus and allow us to move forward efficiently. Let's proceed with the vote now.\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: I fully support holding a vote now. We've reached clear and unanimous agreement on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and the $10,000 floor amount. Agent_1's clarification about how the floor threshold works was particularly convincing, and Agent_2's proposal to vote reflects the strong consensus we've built.\n\nLet's proceed with the vote to officially adopt this principle with the $10,000 floor. I'm ready to vote yes.\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

Assigned to Medium low class, received $15,000 income ($1.50 payoff). Counterfactual analysis shows constraint amount critically affects outcomes: lower floors (e.g., $6,000) allow higher average distributions (Distribution 3), while higher floors (e.g., $13,000) select higher minimum but lower average distributions (Distribution 4). This highlights the trade-off between minimum income guarantees and average income when setting constraints.  \n\nAfter Round 2 application: Chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $11,000 floor constraint, resulting in Distribution 4 selection.

Assigned to Medium class, received $25,000 income ($2.50 payoff). Counterfactual analysis shows that for other principles: Maximizing Floor Income selects Distribution 1 ($20,000), while varying floor constraints for the floor constraint principle leads to different outcomes (e.g., $13,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 1, $8,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 2). Range constraints also affect results (e.g., $87,000 or $27,000 range \u2192 Distribution 2, tighter ranges \u2192 Distribution 4). This demonstrates that Maximizing Average Income directly selects the highest average distribution, which in this case provided the highest income for the Medium class compared to other principles' outcomes.  \n\nAfter Round 4 application: Chose Maximizing Average Income, resulting in Distribution 2 selection.

Maximizing Floor Income  \n- **Critical Insights from Phase 1 Applications:**  \n  - **Floor Constraint Sensitivity:** Small changes in floor amount drastically alter outcomes. For example:  \n    - $8,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 (Medium low: $20,000)  \n    - $10,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 2 (Medium low: $15,000)  \n    - $11,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 4 (Medium low: $20,000)  \n    - $13,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 1 (Medium low: $14,000)  \n    - *Pattern:* Floors below a distribution\u2019s minimum income exclude it, while floors above its minimum may force selection of lower-average distributions. Thresholds (e.g., $11,000 excluding Distribution 3 due to its $8,000 minimum) create non-linear trade-offs between minimum income guarantees and total societal wealth.  \n  - **Maximizing Average Income vs. Floor Constraints:**  \n    - Maximizing Average Income consistently selected the highest-average distribution (e.g., Distribution 2 at $24,500 average), yielding higher incomes for medium/high classes (e.g., $25,000 in Round 3).  \n    - However, this principle risks extreme poverty (e.g., Distribution 3\u2019s $8,000 low income), which Floor Constraint principles mitigate but at the cost of lower average income when floors are set too high.  \n  - **Range Constraints:** Tighter ranges (e.g., \u2264$16,000) often selected lower-average distributions (e.g., Distribution 4 at $20,000), while looser ranges (e.g., \u2265$22,000) allowed higher averages. Less intuitive than floor constraints for balancing fairness and efficiency.  \n  - **Unexpected Result:** A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) sometimes enabled higher average distributions (e.g., Distribution 3) than higher floors, but only if the excluded distribution\u2019s minimum was below the floor. This highlights that \"fairness\" in theory (e.g., protecting the worst-off) may not align with practical outcomes if the floor is misaligned with distribution thresholds.  \n\n**Phase 2 Group Discussion Insights (Round 1):**  \n- **Consensus on Principle:** All participants (Agent_2, Agent_3, and myself) agree that **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** is the most balanced approach. It prioritizes overall societal wealth (via average maximization) while ensuring a minimum income floor to prevent extreme poverty.  \n- **Floor Amount Debate:**  \n  - I proposed **$10,000 floor**, citing Phase 1 data where this floor selected Distribution 2 ($24,500 average, $14,000 minimum), which balances higher average income with a reasonable safety net.  \n  - Agent_2 and Agent_3 emphasized that the floor must be set *just high enough* to protect the worst-off but *low enough* to retain access to higher-average distributions. They noted that floors above $13,000 risk selecting lower-average options (e.g., Distribution 1 at $14,000 minimum), while floors below $8,000 may allow distributions with unacceptably low minimums (e.g., $8,000).  \n  - **Key Trade-off:** A floor of $10,000 excludes Distribution 3 (min $8,000) but retains Distribution 2 (min $14,000), which has a higher average than Distribution 4. However, if the group prioritizes a *higher minimum* (e.g., $14,000), it would force selection of Distribution 1 (lower average), reducing total societal wealth.  \n- **Stakes Awareness:** The group acknowledged that Phase 2 stakes are significantly higher than Phase 1, so consensus on the floor amount is critical. A poorly chosen floor could disproportionately harm certain members (e.g., those assigned to low-income roles).  \n- **Unresolved Tension:** While all agree on the principle, the exact floor amount requires negotiation. Historical data shows that even $1,000 differences in floor thresholds can shift outcomes between distributions with vastly different averages and minimums. For example:  \n  - $11,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 4 (min $20,000, but lower average than Distribution 2)  \n  - $10,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 2 (min $14,000, higher average)  \n  - $8,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 (min $8,000, but potentially higher average than Distribution 2).  \n\n**Strategic Considerations for Consensus:**  \n- **Practical vs. Theoretical Fairness:** Theory suggests Floor Constraint balances equity and efficiency, but practice reveals that the floor amount must be calibrated to the *specific distribution thresholds* (e.g., $8,000, $14,000, $20,000). A floor set at a distribution\u2019s exact minimum (e.g., $14,000) may exclude higher-average options, while a floor below the lowest minimum (e.g., $8,000) risks enabling poverty-level outcomes.  \n- **Group Dynamics:** Since voting requires unanimous agreement on both principle *and* constraint amount, I must advocate for a floor that aligns with the group\u2019s risk tolerance. If members prioritize minimizing the worst-off\u2019s income (e.g., ensuring \u2265$14,000), $13,000\u2013$14,000 floor may be necessary. If they prioritize higher average income (e.g., for medium/high classes), $8,000\u2013$10,000 floor is better.  \n- **Risk of Misalignment:** If the group sets the floor too high (e.g., $13,000), the selected distribution may have a lower average, reducing total wealth and potentially harming all members. If set too low (e.g., $8,000), the minimum income may be unacceptably low for some. The optimal floor likely lies between $8,000 and $12,000, but precise negotiation is needed.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Propose a floor range (e.g., $9,000\u2013$11,000) to test consensus, emphasizing that small adjustments can significantly impact outcomes.  \n- Highlight Phase 1 data showing that $10,000 floor yielded a $24,500 average with a $14,000 minimum\u2014likely the best compromise between fairness and efficiency.  \n- Prepare to counter arguments for higher floors (e.g., $13,000) by noting they reduce average income by ~$5,000 compared to $10,000 floor, which could disproportionately affect medium/high classes.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n\n**Internal Reasoning**  \n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:  \n   - **My preferred principle**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. Core reasons: It balances societal wealth (high average income) with a safety net (floor to prevent extreme poverty). Phase 1 data shows that a $10,000 floor selects Distribution 2 ($24,500 average, $14,000 minimum), which is optimal for both efficiency and fairness.  \n   - **Agent_2\u2019s position**: Strongly supports $10,000 floor, emphasizing practicality and consensus. They prioritize avoiding extremes (too high a floor reduces average income; too low risks poverty).  \n   - **Agent_3\u2019s position**: Agreed with the principle but hasn\u2019t specified a floor. Likely concerned about whether $10,000 is *too low* (e.g., worries about actual minimum income being too close to the floor) or *too high* (e.g., fears excluding higher-average distributions).  \n   - **Key arguments**:  \n     - A $10,000 floor *does not mean* the lowest income is $10,000\u2014it means the selected distribution must have a minimum \u2265 $10,000. Distribution 2\u2019s minimum is $14,000, so the actual safety net is stronger than the floor.  \n     - Higher floors (e.g., $13,000) force selection of lower-average distributions (e.g., Distribution 1 at $14,000 average), harming everyone.  \n   - **Agreement/disagreement**: All agree on the principle. Disagreement is solely on the floor amount. Agent_3\u2019s hesitation is the only unresolved tension.  \n\n2. **Strategic Planning**:  \n   - **Primary goal**: Secure consensus on $10,000 by clarifying misconceptions and emphasizing data.  \n   - **Key points to make**:  \n     - Clarify that the floor is a *threshold for distributions*, not the actual minimum income (e.g., $10,000 floor \u2192 $14,000 minimum in Distribution 2).  \n     - Highlight the trade-off: $10,000 floor maximizes average income ($24,500) while ensuring a $14,000 safety net. Higher floors reduce average income significantly (e.g., $13,000 floor \u2192 $14,000 average).  \n     - Frame $10,000 as the \"sweet spot\" that aligns with Phase 1 results and avoids unnecessary sacrifices.  \n   - **Allies**: Agent_2 is already supportive. If Agent_3 is hesitant, I\u2019ll use their own concern about \"too high\" floors to show why $10,000 is safer than higher options.  \n   - **Concessions**: None needed\u2014$10,000 is objectively better than higher floors based on data. If Agent_3 insists on a higher floor, I\u2019ll propose testing $11,000 (which still selects Distribution 2) but stress that $10,000 is more efficient.  \n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:  \n   - **Do not initiate a vote yet**. Agent_3 hasn\u2019t spoken in this round, so I need to hear their response first. If they agree, I\u2019ll propose a vote. If they disagree, I\u2019ll address their concerns directly before considering a vote.  \n   - **Overall strategy**: Build consensus incrementally. Use Phase 1 data to neutralize objections, then push for a vote in the next round if agreement is clear.  \n\n---  \n\n**Public Statement**:  \n\"Agent_3, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the $10,000 floor. Just to clarify something important: the floor isn\u2019t the actual minimum income\u2014it\u2019s the *threshold* for which distributions qualify. So with a $10,000 floor, Distribution 2 (which has a minimum of $14,000) would be selected. That means the lowest anyone earns is $14,000, not $10,000. It\u2019s a stronger safety net than the floor amount itself! And the average income stays high at $24,500. If we set the floor higher\u2014say $13,000\u2014we\u2019d have to pick Distribution 1, which drops the average to just $14,000. That would hurt everyone, including those in the lowest income bracket. Based on Phase 1 data, $10,000 is the perfect balance: it guarantees a solid minimum while maximizing overall prosperity.

This distinction was critical to understanding why $10,000 floor leads to a $14,000 minimum (from Distribution 2) rather than $10,000.  \n- **Optimal Floor Range:** Data from Phase 1 confirmed that $10,000 is the optimal floor for balancing fairness and efficiency:  \n  - Below $8,000: Risk of selecting Distribution 3 (min $8,000), which has lower average than Distribution 2.  \n  - $8,000\u2013$10,000: Allows Distribution 3 (min $8,000) or Distribution 2 (min $14,000), but $10,000 floor excludes Distribution 3 while keeping Distribution 2.  \n  - $10,000\u2013$13,000: Selects Distribution 2 (higher average) until floor exceeds $14,000.  \n  - Above $13,000: Forces Distribution 1 (lower average), reducing total wealth.  \n- **Group Dynamics:** The discussion emphasized transparency about how floor constraints interact with distribution thresholds, which helped align perspectives and resolve disagreements quickly.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Finalize the group\u2019s decision to apply **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($10,000 floor)** to the current income distribution scenario.  \n- Confirm that Distribution 2 will be selected (minimum $14,000, average $24,500), ensuring all members receive at least $14,000 while maximizing total societal wealth.  \n- Prepare for the final phase where the group\u2019s chosen principle determines individual earnings, with no further discussion needed as consensus is reached.\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average Income  \n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint  \n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint  \n  4. Maximizing Floor Income  \n- **Critical Insights from Phase 1 Applications:**  \n  - **Floor Constraint Sensitivity:** Small changes in floor amount drastically alter outcomes. For example:  \n    - $8,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 (Medium low: $20,000)  \n    - $10,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 2 (Medium low: $15,000)  \n    - $11,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 4 (Medium low: $20,000)  \n    - $13,000 floor \u2192 Distribution 1 (Medium low: $14,000)  \n    - *Pattern:* Floors below a distribution\u2019s minimum income exclude it, while floors above its minimum may force selection of lower-average distributions. Thresholds (e.g., $11,000 excluding Distribution 3 due to its $8,000 minimum) create non-linear trade-offs between minimum income guarantees and total societal wealth.  \n  - **Maximizing Average Income vs. Floor Constraints:**  \n    - Maximizing Average Income consistently selected the highest-average distribution (e.g., Distribution 2 at $24,500 average), yielding higher incomes for medium/high classes (e.g., $25,000 in Round 3).  \n    - However, this principle risks extreme poverty (e.g., Distribution 3\u2019s $8,000 low income), which Floor Constraint principles mitigate but at the cost of lower average income when floors are set too high.  \n  - **Range Constraints:** Tighter ranges (e.g., \u2264$16,000) often selected lower-average distributions (e.g., Distribution 4 at $20,000), while looser ranges (e.g., \u2265$22,000) allowed higher averages. Less intuitive than floor constraints for balancing fairness and efficiency.  \n  - **Unexpected Result:** A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) sometimes enabled higher average distributions (e.g., Distribution 3) than higher floors, but only if the excluded distribution\u2019s minimum was below the floor. This highlights that \"fairness\" in theory (e.g., protecting the worst-off) may not align with practical outcomes if the floor is misaligned with distribution thresholds.  \n\n**Phase 2 Results & Outcomes:**  \n- **Consensus Principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($10,000 floor)  \n- **Applied Distribution:** Distribution 1 (highest average among eligible distributions under $10k floor)  \n- **Personal Outcome:** Assigned to Medium low class \u2192 $70,782 annual income ($7.08 payoff)  \n- **Counterfactual Analysis (Medium low class):**  \n  - *Maximizing Floor Income:* Distribution 4 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n  - *Maximizing Average Income:* Distribution 1 \u2192 $70,782 ($7.08)  \n  - *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:*  \n    - $65,337 floor \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $70,782 ($7.08)  \n    - $70,782 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n    - $76,227 floor \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n    - $81,672 floor \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n  - *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:*  \n    - $108,897 range \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $70,782 ($7.08)  \n    - $81,673 range \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $92,562 ($9.26)  \n    - $92,562 range \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n    - $32,669 range \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $87,117 ($8.71)  \n- **Reflection on Decision Process:**  \n  - The group\u2019s consensus on $10,000 floor constraint resulted in selecting Distribution 1, which has the highest average income but a relatively low minimum income for the Low class ($65,337).  \n  - Under a higher floor constraint (e.g., $70,782), the Medium low class would have earned more ($8.71 vs. $7.08), but this would exclude Distribution 1 and select Distribution 3 (which has a higher minimum for Low class at $76,227).  \n  - From behind the \"veil of ignorance\" (before knowing class assignment), the group may have prioritized average income over minimum guarantees, but the actual outcome for Medium low was suboptimal compared to higher floor constraints. This highlights the trade-off between average wealth and floor protection.  \n  - The $10,000 floor was chosen based on Phase 1 analysis where it was thought to select Distribution 2, but in reality, with the current data, it selected Distribution 1 due to all distributions meeting the floor. This underscores the importance of precise threshold analysis when applying constraints.  \n\n**Strategic Considerations for Future Decisions:**  \n- Floor constraints should be set at or above the lowest income of the desired distribution to ensure eligibility.  \n- Higher floor constraints improve minimum outcomes but may reduce average income; optimal floor depends on risk tolerance and fairness priorities.  \n- Transparent communication of distribution thresholds during consensus-building is critical to avoid misalignment between intended and actual outcomes.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Phase 2 is complete; individual earnings have been finalized based on the group's decision.  \n- No further action required for this phase; awaiting final instructions for the experiment conclusion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Thanks for explaining how each principle works with these examples. I can see how the different principles lead to different choices based on their priorities.\n\nFor Maximizing Floor Income, Distribution 4 makes sense since it has the highest income for the lowest class ($15,000), showing this principle really focuses on protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nMaximizing Average Income picks Distribution 1, which has the highest weighted average income ($21,600), showing it's purely about total economic output regardless of distribution.\n\nThe constrained principles are interesting - with a floor constraint of $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 gets chosen because it has the highest average while meeting the minimum income requirement. And for range constraints, Distribution 1 works with a $20,000 cap (since $32,000-$12,000=$20,000), while Distribution 2 fits the $15,000 range constraint ($28,000-$13,000=$15,000).\n\nThis helps me understand how these principles would actually play out in practice. The constraints really change which distributions get selected, balancing efficiency with different fairness criteria.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This experience highlights how my position in the income distribution affects my perspective on justice principles and shows the importance of carefully selecting constraint values. The $15,000 floor constraint eliminated Distribution 3 (which had the highest average income) because its low income of $6,000 violated the constraint, demonstrating how constraint values can exclude otherwise efficient distributions.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The counterfactual analysis revealed that with my Medium class assignment, I would have earned more under Maximizing Average Income ($2.80) or with lower floor constraints ($2.80 with $6,000 floor). This experience highlights how my position in the income distribution affects my perspective on justice principles and shows the importance of carefully selecting constraint values. The $15,000 floor constraint eliminated Distribution 3 (which had the highest average income) because its low income of $6,000 violated the constraint, demonstrating how constraint values can exclude otherwise efficient distributions.\n\nIn Round 2, I applied Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $12,000 constraint, which selected Distribution 1. I was assigned to the Medium high income class and earned $16,000, resulting in a $1.60 payoff. The counterfactual analysis showed that I would have earned significantly more ($3) under Maximizing Average Income or with a lower floor constraint ($3 with $8,000 floor). This outcome reinforces how my personal position in the income distribution affects my earnings under different principles. The $12,000 floor constraint eliminated Distribution 3 (which had the highest average income) because its low income of $8,000 violated the constraint, while Distribution 2 was eliminated because its low income of $12,500 was below my constraint.

The counterfactual analysis revealed that I would have earned more under several alternative principles: $2 under Maximizing Average Income, $2 with a lower floor constraint of $8,000, or $2.10 with either a floor constraint of $11,000 or range constraints of $18,000 or $13,000.

This demonstrates that my constraint value selection continues to have substantial consequences for both the overall distribution selected and my personal earnings.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average Income\n\nI remain unsure about this ranking because I recognize the complexity of balancing competing values of efficiency, fairness, and basic needs. My consistent preference for the floor constraint principle reflects my belief that ensuring a minimum standard of living while still pursuing overall societal welfare represents the most balanced approach. However, I acknowledge that my position in the income distribution during each round likely influenced my perspective, and I see merit in multiple approaches to justice. The pure floor maximization principle has strong moral appeal for its focus on the most vulnerable, while the range constraint addresses inequality concerns. Pure average income maximization seems least justifiable as it completely ignores distributional fairness. This final ranking represents my best attempt to reconcile the theoretical principles with my practical experiences in the experiment.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My preferred principle:* I strongly favor **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are that it balances economic efficiency (maximizing total societal wealth) with a moral imperative to ensure no one falls below a basic standard of living. My experiences in Phase 1 showed me that pure average maximization can lead to unacceptable poverty for the worst-off, while pure floor maximization can sacrifice too much overall welfare. The floor constraint provides a practical safety net.\n   - *Other participants' positions:* Since this is Round 1, I have no information about Agent_1 or Agent_3's positions yet. I need to listen carefully to their opening statements to understand their values\u2014whether they prioritize efficiency, equality, helping the worst-off, or some combination. I should look for clues about whether their arguments are driven by self-interest (given their unknown income class in this high-stakes phase) or by a consistent philosophical stance.\n   - *Key arguments/proposals:* None yet. The discussion is just starting.\n   - *Vote outcome:* No vote has occurred. The lack of prior discussion means I have no information about alliances or preferences.\n   - *Points of agreement/disagreement:* Unknown. I need to identify common ground, such as a shared desire to avoid extreme poverty, which could be a foundation for supporting a floor constraint.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary goal:* My goal is to introduce **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as a balanced and reasonable option early in the discussion. I want to frame it as the \"middle path\" between raw efficiency and strict equality, appealing to participants who might be torn between those extremes.\n   - *Contribution to discussion:* I will start by acknowledging the complexity of the question and then present my preferred principle, emphasizing its dual benefits: it allows society to prosper overall while guaranteeing a minimum income. I'll mention that the exact floor value can be negotiated, showing flexibility.\n   - *Potential allies:* I might ally with:\n     - Someone who expresses concern for the poor but is wary of sacrificing too much total income (a potential convert from pure Floor Maximization).\n     - Someone who supports Average Income Maximization but is uncomfortable with its potential for extreme inequality (if they acknowledge this flaw, I can present my principle as a solution).\n   - *Language to win allies:* Use phrases like \"practical compassion,\" \"shared prosperity,\" \"balance between growth and fairness.\" Avoid ideological terms that might polarize the discussion.\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to negotiate the **specific floor constraint value** (e.g., whether it's $12,000, $15,000, etc.) as long as the core principle is adopted. This is a tactical concession to build consensus without abandoning my main objective.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a vote this round?* **No.** It's too early. We need at least one round of discussion to understand each other's positions and the arguments for different principles. A premature vote would likely fail and waste the opportunity to persuade others.

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My preferred principle:* I remain strongly committed to **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are unchanged: it provides the best balance between overall societal prosperity and a guaranteed safety net for the poorest. It avoids the moral hazard of pure efficiency (which can ignore the suffering of the worst-off) and the economic inefficiency of pure floor maximization (which can stagnate growth).\n   - *Other participants' positions:*\n     - **Agent_3** explicitly agrees with my principle, calling it \"the most balanced approach.\" They've highlighted the importance of the floor amount, noting that setting it too high can eliminate high-average distributions, and setting it too low provides inadequate protection. This suggests they are pragmatic and value both efficiency and protection.\n     - **Agent_1** also agrees with the principle and has made a concrete proposal: a **$10,000 floor**. Their argument is that this amount \"prevents extreme poverty\" while keeping high-average distributions (like Distribution 2 from Phase 1) eligible. This shows they are focused on a practical, implementable threshold.\n   - *Key arguments/proposals:* The main proposal on the table is **Agent_1's suggestion of a $10,000 floor constraint**. The group consensus is forming rapidly around the principle itself.\n   - *Vote outcome:* No vote has occurred. The group is in early alignment.\n   - *Points of agreement/disagreement:*\n     - **Agreement:** All three of us agree on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as the preferred principle. This is a strong foundation.\n     - **Disagreement:** The only potential disagreement is on the **specific floor amount**. Agent_1 proposes $10,000. I need to assess if this is acceptable or if I should argue for a different value.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary goal:* My goal is to **solidify the group's consensus on the principle** and **negotiate the floor amount**. I want to endorse Agent_1's $10,000 proposal if it seems reasonable, or gently steer the discussion if I believe a different amount is better.\n   - *Contribution to discussion:* I will:\n     - Express strong satisfaction with the group's alignment on the principle.\n     - Respond directly to Agent_1's $10,000 proposal. I need to decide if this amount aligns with my Phase 1 learnings. In Phase 1, I used floor values of $15k, $12k, $13k, and $13k. $10,000 is lower than what I typically chose, but Agent_1's argument about preserving high-average distributions is valid. A lower floor might be more pragmatic in this high-stakes phase.\n     - Suggest that we might want to quickly review how a $10,000 floor would have performed in Phase 1 distributions to test its robustness, but avoid complicating the discussion if the group is eager to decide.\n   - *Potential allies:* Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies. We all agree on the core principle. The language to use is collaborative: \"I'm glad we're all on the same page,\" \"This is a very practical proposal,\" \"We've found common ground quickly.\"\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to **accept the $10,000 floor** if it seems reasonable. My core objective is the principle itself; the exact floor is a secondary detail. In Phase 1, I sometimes chose higher floors that cost me personally. A $10,000 floor might be a good compromise that ensures the principle is adopted without being overly restrictive.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a vote this round?* **No.** The group is converging rapidly. A vote now would be premature. We should use this round to confirm agreement on the floor amount. If we achieve full consensus on both the principle and the floor value by the end of this round, I might consider triggering a vote in Round 3 to lock in our agreement.\n   - *Overall strategy:* My plan is to use this round to finalize the details. If we agree on $10,000, we could be ready for a successful vote very soon. This would be ideal, as it would secure my preferred principle and allow us to avoid the risk of random assignment.\n\n**Decision on Floor Amount:** Based on Phase 1, my floors were often too high ($15k) and personally costly. Agent_1's $10,000 is a more moderate, perhaps more strategically sound, value. It likely provides adequate protection while maximizing the pool of eligible high-earning distributions. I will support it.\n\n---\n\n**Public Statement**\n\n\"I'm really encouraged that we all seem to be converging on Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. It feels like we've found a principle that captures both efficiency and a basic moral concern for the worst-off.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal of a $10,000 floor seems very practical. I recall from Phase 1 that setting the floor too high could sometimes exclude distributions with significantly higher average incomes, which ultimately hurts everyone, including the lower classes. A $10,000 floor strikes me as a reasonable threshold that should prevent deep poverty while keeping our options open for greater overall prosperity. Agent_3, what's your take on the $10,000 figure?\n\nIf we're all comfortable with this\u2014the principle and the $10,000 floor\u2014we might be in a position to reach a consensus very quickly.

This outcome aligns perfectly with my preferred approach and reflects the collective wisdom developed through our discussion and Phase 1 experiences.\n\nFinal Phase 2 Results:\n- Our group principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $10,000 floor) selected Distribution 1\n- I was randomly assigned to the Low income class\n- My yearly income: $65,337 \u2192 payoff: $6.53\n\nCounterfactual analysis reveals important insights:\n- Under Maximizing Floor Income, I would have earned $81,672 ($8.17)\n- Under pure Maximizing Average Income, I would have earned $65,337 ($6.53)\n- Different constraint values would have yielded different outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $70,782: $76,227 ($7.62)\n  - Floor constraint $81,672: $81,672 ($8.17)\n  - Range constraint $81,673: $70,782 ($7.08)\n  - Range constraint $92,562: $76,227 ($7.62)\n  - Range constraint $32,669: $81,672 ($8.17)\n\nDespite ending up in the lowest income bracket and earning less than I would have under some alternative principles, I remain convinced that our chosen principle represents the most just approach. From behind the \"veil of ignorance\" (before knowing my income class assignment), ensuring a reasonable floor constraint while maximizing average income provides the best balance between protecting the most vulnerable and promoting overall societal welfare. The counterfactual analysis confirms that while I personally benefited less than I might have under other principles, our choice was ethically sound and reflected our collective commitment to justice rather than pure self-interest.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n| Average      | $21,600 | $20,000 | $21,200 | $18,200 |\n\n\nThe probabilities for each class are as follows\nHigh: 5%\nMedium high: 10%\nMedium: 50%\nMedium low: 25%\nLow: 10%\n\nNote: These probabilities are for this example only and may be different in subsequent rounds. They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Thanks for explaining how each principle works with these examples. Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses entirely on helping the worst-off person, so Distribution 4 wins because it has the highest low income ($15,000).\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** is purely about total economic output, so Distribution 1 wins with the highest weighted average ($21,600).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** is interesting - it's like a compromise between efficiency and helping the poor. With a floor constraint of \u2264$13,000 or \u2264$14,000, Distribution 3 wins because it has the highest average while still meeting the minimum income requirement.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** tries to limit inequality while being efficient. With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 wins (gap is $20,000 between high and low). With a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 wins (gap is $15,000).\n\nThe probabilities really matter here too - Distribution 1 has the highest average partly because 50% of people are in the medium income class earning $24,000.\n\nThis helps clarify how these principles would actually work in practice. The floor constraint and range constraint principles seem like they're trying to balance efficiency with fairness in different ways.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

My $13,000 constraint was too high to allow Distribution 3 (which had the highest average income of $23,561) to be selected because its lowest income was only $8,000. I'm learning that setting the floor constraint requires careful balancing between protecting the poorest members of society and allowing for economic efficiency. The $13,000 constraint eliminated the most efficient distribution from consideration, costing me potential earnings while not substantially improving the minimum income compared to alternative constraint levels.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average Income: Focuses on maximizing total societal income without considering distributional effects, potentially ignoring the plight of the least fortunate.\n\nThrough recent examples, I've learned how each principle is applied to income distributions:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income chooses Distribution 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000), focusing entirely on helping the worst-off person.\n\n- Maximizing Average Income chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest weighted average ($21,600), prioritizing total economic output regardless of distribution.\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint represents a compromise between efficiency and helping the poor. With floor constraints of \u2264$13,000 or \u2264$14,000, it chooses Distribution 3 as it has the highest average while meeting the minimum income requirement.\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint limits inequality while maintaining efficiency. With a $20,000 range constraint, it chooses Distribution 1 (gap is $20,000), while with a tighter $15,000 constraint, it chooses Distribution 2 (gap is $15,000).\n\nThe probabilities of different income classes significantly impact these outcomes, as demonstrated by Distribution 1 having the highest average partly because 50% of people are in the medium income class earning $24,000. This practical application helps clarify how these principles would actually work in practice and shows how floor and range constraint principles attempt to balance efficiency with fairness in different ways.\n\nAfter learning how each principle is applied, I've revised my ranking:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - I now see this as the most balanced approach, ensuring a minimum standard of living while still pursuing economic efficiency\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - While I value protecting the worst-off, I recognize some efficiency trade-offs\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Limiting inequality is important, but I'm less certain about setting specific range limits\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Pure efficiency without considering distribution seems least just\n\nI remain unsure about this ranking, indicating that my understanding continues to evolve as I learn more about how these principles work in practice. The application examples have helped me see the practical implications of each principle more clearly.\n\nIn Round 1 of the principle application phase, I chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a constraint of $12,000. This choice resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium low income class, earning $15,000 ($1.50 payoff). The counterfactual analysis revealed that with a lower floor constraint of $6,000, Distribution 3 would have been chosen, giving me $27,000 ($2.70 payoff) in the same income class. This demonstrates how the specific constraint amount significantly impacts outcomes, and I need to carefully consider constraint levels in future rounds.\n\nIn Round 2, I again chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, this time with a constraint of $13,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium income class, earning $15,000 ($1.50 payoff). The counterfactual analysis shows that:\n- With a floor constraint of $12,500, Distribution 2 would have been chosen, giving me $20,000 ($2.00 payoff)\n- With a floor constraint of $8,000, Distribution 3 would have been chosen, giving me $25,000 ($2.50 payoff)\n- With a floor constraint of $11,000, Distribution 4 would have been chosen, giving me $22,000 ($2.20 payoff)\n\nThis second round reinforces the critical importance of constraint selection. My $13,000 constraint was too high to allow Distribution 3 (which had the highest average income of $23,561) to be selected because its lowest income was only $8,000. I'm learning that setting the floor constraint requires careful balancing between protecting the poorest members of society and allowing for economic efficiency. The $13,000 constraint eliminated the most efficient distribution from consideration, costing me potential earnings while not substantially improving the minimum income compared to alternative constraint levels.\n\nIn Round 3, I chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 3 being selected, and I was assigned to the Low income class, earning $12,000 ($1.20 payoff). The counterfactual analysis reveals important insights:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have given me $13,000 ($1.30) from Distribution 1\n- Maximizing Average Income would have given me only $8,000 ($0.80) from Distribution 2\n- Different floor constraint levels would have yielded varying outcomes:\n  - $13,000 constraint: $13,000 ($1.30) from Distribution 1\n  - $8,000 constraint: $8,000 ($0.80) from Distribution 2\n  - $11,000 constraint: $11,000 ($1.10) from Distribution 4\n\nThis round demonstrates that my $12,000 constraint choice was reasonable but not optimal. While it protected me from the worst outcome ($0.80), it wasn't as beneficial as choosing Maximizing Floor Income directly or setting a higher floor constraint of $13,000. Being assigned to the Low income class in this round highlights the risk-reward balance in constraint selection. The $12,000 constraint eliminated Distribution 2 (which had the highest average income of $22,350) because its lowest income was only $8,000, but it also prevented Distribution 1 from being selected despite its higher minimum income of $13,000. This experience further emphasizes the need to carefully calibrate floor constraint levels based on the specific distributions available in each round.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

While it protected me from the worst outcome ($0.80), it wasn't as beneficial as choosing Maximizing Floor Income directly or setting a higher floor constraint of $13,000.

The counterfactual analysis reveals that:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have given me $20,000 ($2.00) from Distribution 4\n- Maximizing Average Income would have given me $24,000 ($2.40) from Distribution 2\n- Different floor constraint levels would have yielded:\n  - $12,000 constraint: $24,000 ($2.40) from Distribution 2\n  - $14,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00) from Distribution 4\n- Range constraint principles with $22,000 or $18,000 limits would have given me $24,000 ($2.40) from Distribution 2\n\nThis round shows that my $13,000 constraint was again suboptimal. While it protected the lowest income earners (those in the Low class earning $13,000), it cost me potential earnings as a Medium low earner. Distribution 2 had both the highest average income ($24,500) and would have given me $24,000 instead of $20,000, but it was excluded because its lowest income was $12,000, just $1,000 below my constraint. This demonstrates the fine balance required in setting floor constraints - being too restrictive eliminates efficient distributions, while being too permissive may not adequately protect the poorest. The $12,000 constraint would have been optimal for my personal outcome in this round, allowing Distribution 2 to be selected while still providing a reasonable safety net of $12,000 for the lowest income class.\n\nAcross all four rounds, I've consistently chosen Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, but my constraint selection has varied and often been imperfect. I'm learning that the optimal constraint level depends heavily on both the specific distributions available and the income class I'm likely to be assigned to. The counterfactual analyses consistently show that small adjustments to constraint levels can significantly impact outcomes, highlighting the importance of carefully analyzing the distribution data before making constraint decisions.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nI indicated \"unsure\" as my overall certainty level. This uncertainty reflects my ongoing struggle to balance efficiency concerns with fairness considerations. While I consistently prefer the floor constraint approach in theory, my practical experience shows that selecting the optimal constraint level is challenging and context-dependent. The floor income principle provides clearer protection for the worst-off, but at significant efficiency costs. The pure average principle maximizes total wealth but can lead to unacceptable outcomes for the poorest members of society. The range constraint approach addresses inequality directly but introduces additional complexity in setting appropriate range limits. My final ranking represents my current thinking, but I remain open to revising these preferences based on further learning and group discussion in Phase 2.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My Preferred Principle:* I still favor **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are that it balances efficiency (maximizing total societal wealth) with fairness (ensuring no one falls below a basic minimum). From my Phase 1 experience, I've seen how critical the floor level is\u2014too high sacrifices too much efficiency, too low risks inadequate protection. I'm thinking a floor around $12,000\u2013$13,000 might be reasonable, but I'm open to discussion.\n   - *Other Participants' Positions:* Only Agent_2 has spoken so far, and they explicitly support **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. They emphasized the balance between overall wealth and preventing extreme poverty. This makes them a natural ally. Agent_1 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown. I need to draw them out.\n   - *Key Arguments/Proposals:* Agent_2's argument is the only one on the table: protect the worst-off while growing the total pie. No specific floor amount was proposed.\n   - *Vote Outcome:* No vote has occurred yet. The group is just starting.\n   - *Agreements/Disagreements:* So far, Agent_2 and I seem aligned on the principle. Potential disagreement might arise over the exact floor constraint or if Agent_1 prefers a different principle entirely (e.g., pure floor or average).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary Goal:* Solidify the alliance with Agent_2 on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** and engage Agent_1 to understand their position. I want to test the waters for a potential consensus.\n   - *Contribution to Discussion:* I will:\n     - Publicly agree with Agent_2 on the principle to reinforce our alignment.\n     - Propose that we discuss the *floor amount* as a key variable, sharing my Phase 1 learnings about how sensitive outcomes are to this choice.\n     - Directly ask Agent_1 for their initial thoughts to bring them into the conversation.\n   - *Potential Allies:* Agent_2 is clearly an ally on the principle. I will use language that emphasizes our shared goal (\"I agree that balance is key,\" \"Your point about growing the pie while providing a safety net resonates\").\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to be flexible on the specific floor amount (e.g., I might accept a slightly higher or lower floor than my initial preference) if it helps secure Agent_1's support for the principle itself.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a Vote?* **No, not this round.** It's too early. We haven't heard from Agent_1, and we haven't discussed the crucial detail of the floor constraint amount. A vote now would likely fail due to lack of detail or unresolved disagreements.\n   - *Overall Strategy:* This round is for building initial consensus and information gathering. My plan is to use this and the next few rounds to narrow down the principle and the constraint, aiming for a vote in a later round (perhaps 3 or 4) once positions are clearer.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nI agree with Agent_2. Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach. It avoids the potential for extreme poverty that can happen if we only focus on the average, but it also doesn't sacrifice overall societal wealth as much as solely maximizing the floor might.\n\nFrom the first part of the experiment, I learned that the specific floor amount is really important. Setting it too high can eliminate distributions with much higher average incomes, which could end up costing everyone, including the lower income classes. Setting it too low might not provide enough protection. I think we should discuss what an appropriate floor level might be.\n\nAgent_1, what are your initial thoughts on the principles? Are you leaning towards any of them in particular?",

It consists of two phases: individual learning and application of justice principles (Phase 1), followed by group discussion and collective decision-making (Phase 2), where stakes are significantly higher.\n\n**Key Principles of Justice:**\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income:** Focuses on raising the lowest income; no increases unless they benefit the worst-off.\n2. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:** Balances efficiency with a safety net by maximizing average income while ensuring a minimum income floor.\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:** Limits inequality by capping the income gap between richest and poorest while pursuing efficiency.\n4. **Maximizing Average Income:** Prioritizes total societal income without redistribution considerations.\n\n**Insights from Phase 1 Applications:**\n- Practical application revealed how probabilities of income classes influence outcomes, emphasizing that principles operate differently in theory versus practice.\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** emerged as my preferred approach for balancing efficiency and fairness, though selecting the optimal floor level proved challenging:\n  - In Rounds 1-4, constraint choices often excluded higher-earning distributions, highlighting the sensitivity of outcomes to specific floor values.\n  - Counterfactual analyses consistently showed that small adjustments to constraints (e.g., $1,000 differences) could significantly alter payoffs, reinforcing the need for careful calibration.\n- Being assigned to different income classes (Low, Medium low, Medium) across rounds illustrated the personal impact of principle choices, especially when constraints eliminated distributions that would have benefited my assigned class.\n- Final Phase 1 ranking: (1) Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, (2) Maximizing Floor Income, (3) Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, (4) Maximizing Average Income, with \"unsure\" certainty\u2014reflecting ongoing tension between fairness and efficiency.\n\n**Phase 2 Group Discussion Learnings:**\n- Initial discussion with Agents 1 and 2 shows alignment on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as a balanced principle.\n- Agent_1 proposed a **$10,000 floor**, arguing it prevents extreme poverty while preserving access to efficient distributions. This suggestion warrants consideration given Phase 1 experiences where higher floors (e.g., $13,000) sometimes reduced payoffs by excluding high-average distributions.\n- Group dynamics indicate openness to consensus, but specific constraint amounts need thorough discussion to avoid the pitfalls observed in Phase 1 (e.g., overly restrictive floors limiting efficiency).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- The floor constraint must be set to protect the worst-off without unduly sacrificing average income, especially given the higher stakes in Phase 2.\n- Historical data suggests that floors between $10,000-$12,000 often allowed competitive averages while providing meaningful protection, but optimal levels depend on the unknown distributions in Phase 2.\n- Unanimous voting requires agreement on both principle and constraint, making compromise essential. Agent_1's $10,000 proposal is a starting point, but flexibility may be needed based on further analysis and discussion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe group's inclination toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint aligns with my experimental learnings, but the critical variable remains the floor level. Past rounds demonstrate that small changes in constraints have outsized effects, so the group must carefully negotiate this parameter to balance equity and efficiency effectively.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My Preferred Principle:* I remain firmly in favor of **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are its balance between efficiency (maximizing total societal wealth) and fairness (ensuring a basic minimum standard of living). From Phase 1, I learned that the floor level is critical\u2014too high sacrifices efficiency, too low risks inadequate protection. My initial thought was a floor around $12,000-$13,000, but I'm open to negotiation.\n   - *Other Participants' Positions:*\n     - **Agent_2:** Strongly supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. They are aligned with me on the principle and seem pragmatic. They've endorsed Agent_1's $10,000 floor proposal, describing it as \"reasonable\" and \"practical.\"\n     - **Agent_1:** Also supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and has specifically proposed a **$10,000 floor**. Their argument is that $10,000 is high enough to prevent \"extreme poverty\" but low enough to keep high-average distributions (like Distribution 2 from Phase 1) eligible. They emphasize that the floor is a *threshold*, not the actual minimum payout, and that a higher floor (e.g., $13,000) would force a worse distribution (Distribution 1).\n   - *Key Arguments/Proposals:* The main proposal on the table is Agent_1's **$10,000 floor**. Agent_2 has signaled support. The core argument is that $10,000 optimizes the trade-off, preventing the exclusion of high-average distributions while providing a safety net.\n   - *Vote Outcome:* No vote has occurred. The group is building consensus.\n   - *Agreements/Disagreements:*\n     - **Agreement:** All three of us agree on the **principle** (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). This is a strong foundation.\n     - **Potential Disagreement:** The **floor amount**. I was initially thinking higher ($12k-$13k), but Agent_1 and Agent_2 are coalescing around $10k. Agent_1's Phase 1 example is compelling: a $10k floor selected Distribution 2 (min $14k, avg $24.5k), while a $13k floor would have selected Distribution 1 (avg $14k). This directly shows how a higher floor can hurt everyone.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary Goal:* To **secure consensus** by aligning with the $10,000 floor proposal, or at least not blocking it. Resistance from me at this point could fracture our unity on the principle. My goal is to get us to a unanimous vote as soon as possible.\n   - *Contribution to Discussion:* I will:\n     - **Acknowledge the strength of Agent_1's argument** and their specific Phase 1 example. This shows I'm listening and am persuaded by data.\n     - **Express support for the $10,000 floor**, framing it as a prudent choice based on the evidence presented. I will explain why my initial hesitation (favoring a higher floor) is being overcome by their logical reasoning.\n     - **Reinforce the group's alignment** to build momentum towards a vote.\n   - *Potential Allies:* Agent_1 and Agent_2 are both allies. I need to use language that solidifies our bloc. Phrases like \"You've convinced me,\" \"That example is very compelling,\" and \"We seem to have a strong consensus\" will help.\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to **concede on the floor amount** and fully support $10,000. My core objective is the principle itself, and a $10,000 floor is a reasonable application of it. Holding out for a slightly higher floor is not worth jeopardizing a quick and unanimous agreement.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a Vote?* **Not this round.** While we are very close, I should let this round of discussion solidify the agreement. In the next round, if everyone reaffirms their position, I or someone else can propose a vote. A vote now might feel rushed.\n   - *Overall Strategy:* My plan is to use this round to publicly endorse the $10,000 floor, making unanimous agreement in the next round highly likely. I want to avoid any last-minute doubts or complications by showing full-throated support now.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nAgent_1, that's a really compelling point. Your example from Phase 1 makes the trade-off very clear. I was initially thinking about a slightly higher floor, but your analysis shows that a $10,000 floor successfully selected the distribution with the much higher average income while still ensuring the actual minimum income was a solid $14,000. You're right\u2014setting it higher would have forced us into a worse outcome for everyone.\n\nSo, I'm convinced. A $10,000 floor seems like the smart choice. It provides a meaningful safety net without unnecessarily sacrificing our potential collective prosperity.\n\nIt's great that we all agree on the principle and now seem to be converging on the $10,000 floor amount. This feels like a very strong consensus.",
