I'd like to propose that we choose the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle for our group decision. Here's why: it strikes a balance between fairness and overall prosperity. By setting a guaranteed minimum income (the floor), we ensure no one is left in dire straits\u2014protecting the most vulnerable members of the group. At the same time, by maximizing the average *above* that floor, we still aim for the highest possible collective income. \n\nFor example, if we set a floor of $10,000, we\u2019d prioritize distributions where everyone earns at least that much, while also maximizing the total average. This avoids the risk of extreme inequality (like what could happen with pure \"Maximizing Average Income,\" where some might end up with very low incomes) while also preventing the overly conservative outcome of \"Maximizing Floor Income,\" which might sacrifice too much overall prosperity for a high floor. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I\u2019m curious to hear how you see the trade-offs between fairness and efficiency, and whether you have any concerns or ideas about what a reasonable floor value might be. Let\u2019s figure this out together! \ud83d\ude0a\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nHi Agent_1 and Agent_2, I completely agree with your proposal for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"! This principle really resonates with me based on my experiences in Phase 1.\n\nFrom my previous applications, I found this principle strikes an excellent balance between fairness and efficiency. In Phase 1, I saw how it guaranteed a minimum income for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity above that floor. This approach avoids the extreme inequality that could result from pure \"Maximizing Average Income\" and prevents the overly conservative outcomes of \"Maximizing Floor Income\" that might sacrifice too much overall prosperity.\n\nI particularly appreciated how, with careful constraint selection, this principle could perform as well as unconstrained average maximization in some cases (like in my fourth application round where I earned $26,000 under both principles). The key is finding the right floor amount that ensures basic needs are met without being so high that it significantly reduces overall prosperity.\n\nI'm definitely in favor of this principle. What do you think, Agent_2? And should we discuss what floor constraint amount might work best for our group? I'm open to different suggestions as long as we maintain this core principle.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \nHi Agent_1 and Agent_3, I'm really glad to see that we're all aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle! This makes me confident we can reach a good group decision.\n\nFrom my experience in Phase 1, this principle worked consistently well for me across all four rounds, earning me a total of $7.50. What I appreciated most was how it guaranteed a minimum income while still allowing for overall prosperity. In my applications, I found that setting the floor constraint at different amounts could significantly impact outcomes, so I think we should carefully consider what floor amount would work best for our group.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experiences, I noticed that floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well, providing decent protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity. But I'm open to discussing what amount would work best for our group's priorities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on an appropriate floor constraint amount? Should we aim for a relatively modest floor that protects basic needs but allows for greater overall prosperity, or a higher floor that provides more security but potentially reduces the average income?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nBased on our discussion so far, I think we're making good progress toward consensus on both our principle and the floor constraint amount. \n\nFrom my Phase 1 experiences, I found that the $11,000-$12,000 range I mentioned earlier worked well in several scenarios. In one round, a $12,000 floor constraint actually matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization ($26,000), while still providing that crucial minimum income guarantee. However, I also learned that sometimes a slightly lower or higher floor can perform better depending on the specific distribution options available.\n\nI'm leaning toward suggesting $12,000 as our floor constraint amount. Here's why:\n1. It's high enough to provide meaningful protection for those at the bottom\n2. In my experience, it often performs well without excessively limiting overall prosperity\n3. It represents a reasonable middle ground between basic needs protection and maximizing potential earnings\n\nThat said, I'm flexible and want to hear what you both think. Agent_2, you mentioned $10,000-$13,000 worked well for you - did you have a specific preference within that range? Agent_1, what are your thoughts on balancing security versus prosperity?\n\nI think if we can agree on a specific floor amount soon, we can move toward a vote and finalize our group decision. What do you both think about $12,000 as our floor constraint?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \n\nAgent_3, I completely agree with your $12,000 proposal\u2014it\u2019s the perfect balance of protection and prosperity. As you noted, it matched unconstrained average earnings in your Phase 1 scenario, which shows it doesn\u2019t sacrifice overall prosperity while still guaranteeing a meaningful floor. Agent_2, since $12k is right in the middle of your suggested $10k\u2013$13k range, do you feel this is a good fit for our group? If so, I\u2019d propose we vote to finalize it now to keep us on track. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re all aligned before moving forward!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: \nAgent_1 and Agent_3, I'm very pleased with our progress toward consensus! I completely support both the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle and the $12,000 floor constraint amount that Agent_3 proposed.\n\nThis $12,000 amount fits perfectly within the range I found effective in my Phase 1 experiences ($10,000-$13,000). From my applications, I saw how this principle consistently provided both security and reasonable earnings across different class assignments. The $12,000 floor should offer meaningful protection for those at the bottom while still allowing for substantial overall prosperity.\n\nI appreciate how we've all recognized this principle's balance between fairness and efficiency. It guarantees a minimum income for the most vulnerable while maximizing potential earnings above that floor, which aligns well with my positive experiences in Phase 1 where I earned a total of $7.50 across four rounds.\n\nI agree with Agent_1 that we should move to a vote now to finalize our decision. With all three of us aligned on both the principle and the specific floor constraint amount, I'm confident we can achieve unanimous confirmation. Let's proceed with the vote!\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n\nAs Agent_1, my internal reasoning for this round is focused on strategically advocating for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as the group\u2019s principle. In Phase 1, this was my top-ranked choice because it balances fairness and efficiency: it guarantees a minimum income (the floor) to protect the worst-off while still maximizing the overall average. This feels like the most equitable approach for a high-stakes scenario where we don\u2019t know our own position in the distribution. \n\nIf we choose **Maximizing Floor Income** alone, the average might drop significantly\u2014potentially hurting most people\u2019s payoffs even if the floor is high. **Maximizing Average Income** risks extreme inequality, where some could end up with very low incomes, which feels unfair. **Range Constraint** seems less directly relevant to core fairness concerns compared to a floor, which explicitly addresses poverty. \n\nSince the stakes are higher here, I need to avoid a random outcome by building consensus. My first move should be to clearly propose principle 1 in the discussion, emphasizing its balance: \"We ensure no one is left in dire straits while still maximizing the group\u2019s total prosperity.\" I\u2019ll ask others for their thoughts to gauge their priorities. If someone prefers **Maximizing Floor Income**, I might suggest a moderate floor value (e.g., $10k\u2013$15k) to show flexibility. If others lean toward **Maximizing Average Income**, I\u2019ll argue that a floor is necessary to prevent catastrophic outcomes for the least fortunate. \n\nMy goal for this round is to start the conversation around principle 1 without forcing a vote yet. I\u2019ll listen carefully to others\u2019 arguments to identify potential allies\u2014maybe those who value fairness but also care about overall prosperity\u2014and frame the discussion as a collaborative effort to find the \"best of both worlds.\" If they\u2019re hesitant, I\u2019ll ask questions like, \"What would make you feel comfortable with a floor constraint?\" to uncover shared concerns. \n\nNo vote this round; focus on laying the groundwork for consensus. If the group seems open to principle 1, we can discuss the floor value later. If not, I\u2019ll adapt my pitch based on their feedback while staying firm on the core idea that a floor + average balance is the most just approach.",
            "public_message": "\n\nHi everyone, thanks for joining this discussion. I'd like to propose that we choose the **\"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"** principle for our group decision. Here's why: it strikes a balance between fairness and overall prosperity. By setting a guaranteed minimum income (the floor), we ensure no one is left in dire straits\u2014protecting the most vulnerable members of the group. At the same time, by maximizing the average *above* that floor, we still aim for the highest possible collective income. \n\nFor example, if we set a floor of $10,000, we\u2019d prioritize distributions where everyone earns at least that much, while also maximizing the total average. This avoids the risk of extreme inequality (like what could happen with pure \"Maximizing Average Income,\" where some might end up with very low incomes) while also preventing the overly conservative outcome of \"Maximizing Floor Income,\" which might sacrifice too much overall prosperity for a high floor. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I\u2019m curious to hear how you see the trade-offs between fairness and efficiency, and whether you have any concerns or ideas about what a reasonable floor value might be. Let\u2019s figure this out together! \ud83d\ude0a",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning for Round 2  \n\n#### **1. Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current Principle Agreement**: All participants (Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3) have already unanimously agreed on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as the group principle. The only remaining issue is the specific floor value.  \n- **Key Proposals**:  \n  - Agent_3 explicitly proposes **$12,000** as the floor, citing Phase 1 data where this value matched unconstrained average earnings ($26,000) while ensuring a minimum income guarantee.  \n  - Agent_2 previously suggested a range of **$10,000\u2013$13,000**, emphasizing flexibility but noting this range \"worked well\" in their Phase 1 experience (total $7.50 across four rounds).  \n- **Underlying Motivations**:  \n  - **Agent_3** prioritizes consistency and balance: They want a floor high enough to protect the vulnerable but not so high that it sacrifices overall prosperity. Their $12,000 proposal reflects a data-driven middle ground (e.g., matching unconstrained average in some scenarios).  \n  - **Agent_2** seems risk-averse about setting the floor too high (to preserve average income) but still values protection for the bottom tier. Their $10k\u2013$13k range suggests they\u2019re open to compromise but may prefer the lower end (e.g., $10k\u2013$11k) to maximize prosperity.  \n- **Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All support the principle and recognize the need for a moderate floor.  \n  - **Disagreement**: None yet\u2014Agent_2 hasn\u2019t responded to Agent_3\u2019s $12k proposal, so the floor value is still unresolved. However, $12k falls squarely within Agent_2\u2019s stated range, making consensus highly probable.  \n\n#### **2. Strategic Planning**  \n- **Primary Goal**: Secure immediate consensus on **$12,000** as the floor value. This is the most efficient path to finalizing the principle and avoiding random assignment later.  \n- **Key Actions**:  \n  - **Affirm Agent_3\u2019s proposal**: Explicitly endorse $12,000 as the optimal floor, highlighting its balance (e.g., \"It\u2019s high enough to protect basic needs but low enough to avoid sacrificing too much average prosperity\").  \n  - **Directly engage Agent_2**: Ask, \"Agent_2, since $12,000 is within your suggested $10k\u2013$13k range, do you feel comfortable with this specific amount?\" This frames the question as a confirmation of their prior input rather than a new demand.  \n  - **Leverage data**: Cite Agent_3\u2019s example where $12k matched unconstrained average earnings\u2014this addresses Agent_2\u2019s concern about \"sacrificing prosperity\" by showing it *doesn\u2019t* reduce outcomes in practice.  \n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - **Agent_3** is already a strong ally and will likely support $12k.  \n  - **Agent_2** is likely to agree since $12k is within their range. If they hesitate, I\u2019ll emphasize that $12k is the *midpoint* of their suggested range (10k\u201313k), making it a natural compromise.  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - If Agent_2 insists on a lower floor (e.g., $11k), I\u2019ll accept it\u2014**but only if it\u2019s necessary to reach consensus**. However, given Agent_3\u2019s data and the midpoint logic, I don\u2019t expect resistance.  \n\n#### **3. Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round?** **Yes**, but **only after confirming Agent_2\u2019s agreement**.  \n  - If Agent_2 says \"yes\" to $12k, propose an immediate vote to finalize the floor. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth and aligns with the goal of reaching consensus before round 10.  \n  - If Agent_2 objects, I\u2019ll adjust to $11k (still within their range) and then vote. A failed vote has no penalty, so even if they reject $12k, we can quickly pivot.  \n- **Overall Strategy Fit**:  \n  - Resolving the floor value this round ensures we lock in a clear principle before later rounds, where we might face more complex trade-offs.  \n  - If we fail to agree today, we risk delaying consensus until later rounds, increasing the chance of random assignment (which would hurt all participants). Prioritizing speed here is critical.  \n\n#### **Key Takeaway**:  \nThe group is *this close* to consensus. My role is to bridge the final gap by framing $12k as the logical midpoint of Agent_2\u2019s range and reinforcing its proven efficacy (via Agent_3\u2019s data). No need for hard bargaining\u2014just clear, collaborative alignment.  \n\n---  \n**Public Statement Draft (for reference)**:  \n\"Agent_3, I completely agree with your $12,000 proposal\u2014it\u2019s the perfect balance of protection and prosperity. As you noted, it matched unconstrained average earnings in your Phase 1 scenario, which shows it doesn\u2019t sacrifice overall prosperity while still guaranteeing a meaningful floor.

Here's my understanding:\n\n**Maximizing Floor Income** focuses solely on helping the worst-off individuals. In this case, Distribution 4 is chosen because it has the highest income for the lowest class ($15,000), even though it has the lowest overall average income.\n\n**Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth. Distribution 1 is selected because it has the highest average income ($21,600), even though it has the lowest income for the worst-off ($12,000).\n\n**Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** combines both approaches by setting a minimum income threshold and then maximizing average income among distributions that meet this threshold:\n- For a floor constraint of \u2264 $13,000: Distribution 3 is chosen because it has the highest average ($21,200) among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000.\n- For a floor constraint of \u2264 $14,000: Distribution 3 is again chosen because it has the highest average among distributions where everyone earns at least $14,000.\n\n**Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** limits the income gap between richest and poorest while maximizing average income:\n- For a range constraint of \u2264 $20,000: Distribution 1 is chosen because it has the highest average among distributions where the income difference between richest and poorest is \u2264 $20,000.\n- For a range constraint of \u2264 $15,000: Distribution 2 is chosen because it has the highest average among distributions where the income difference is \u2264 $15,000.\n\nThese examples clearly show how different justice principles prioritize different values - some focusing on helping the worst-off, others on maximizing total wealth, and others on balancing both concerns with specific constraints.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This principle balances ensuring a minimum income for vulnerable people while maximizing overall prosperity.\n- Other participants' positions: Agent_1 has proposed \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with strong reasoning about balancing fairness and efficiency. Agent_3 has expressed complete agreement based on positive Phase 1 experiences.\n- Key arguments on the table: Agent_1 emphasized the principle's balance between protecting the vulnerable and maximizing collective income. Agent_3 highlighted personal success with this principle.\n- No vote has been conducted yet.\n- Points of agreement: All three participants appear to favor \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\" The main point to resolve is the specific floor constraint amount.\n\n**Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n- Primary goal: Confirm agreement on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our principle and begin discussing an appropriate floor constraint amount.\n- How I'll contribute: I'll express strong support for the principle, share my positive Phase 1 experiences, and suggest we discuss floor constraint amounts before voting.\n- Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 already align with my preferred principle.\n- Concessions: I'm open to discussing different floor constraint amounts as long as we maintain the core principle.\n\n**Voting Strategy:**\n- It makes sense to wait before initiating a vote. While we appear to agree on the principle, we still need to discuss the floor constraint amount, which is crucial for implementation. With 10 rounds available, there's no need to rush the voting process.\n- My overall strategy is to secure \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our chosen principle with an appropriate floor constraint that balances fairness and efficiency based on our collective experiences.\n\n**Public Response:**\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_3, I'm really glad to see that we're all aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle! This makes me confident we can reach a good group decision.\n\nFrom my experience in Phase 1, this principle worked consistently well for me across all four rounds, earning me a total of $7.50. What I appreciated most was how it guaranteed a minimum income while still allowing for overall prosperity. In my applications, I found that setting the floor constraint at different amounts could significantly impact outcomes, so I think we should carefully consider what floor amount would work best for our group.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experiences, I noticed that floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well, providing decent protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity. But I'm open to discussing what amount would work best for our group's priorities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on an appropriate floor constraint amount? Should we aim for a relatively modest floor that protects basic needs but allows for greater overall prosperity, or a higher floor that provides more security but potentially reduces the average income?",

significantly impacts outcomes\n- Lower floors tend to allow for higher average incomes but provide less protection\n- Higher floors provide more security but may reduce overall prosperity\n- The principle can sometimes perform as well as unconstrained average maximization when the constraint is set appropriately\n- In my Phase 1 experience, this principle provided both security and reasonable earnings across different class assignments\n\nKey Insights from Phase 2:\n- Group consensus was efficiently reached on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with $12,000 floor constraint\n- All participants contributed meaningfully to the discussion\n- The $12,000 floor constraint aligned with my Phase 1 experiences where $10,000-$13,000 performed well\n- My actual earnings ($7.87) were higher than what I earned in Phase 1\n- The counterfactual analysis shows that with a Medium class assignment, I would have earned the same under Maximizing Average Income ($7.87)\n- Different constraint amounts for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint would have resulted in different earnings\n- The veil of ignorance perspective requires evaluating principles before knowing one's class assignment\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- My initial ranking of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as the most just principle was validated by the actual outcomes\n- The group decision process worked effectively, with all participants contributing to reach consensus\n- The experiment demonstrates how different justice principles can lead to different distributional outcomes\n- The constraint amount significantly impacts the trade-off between equity and efficiency\n- My experience aligns with the principle that balancing floor protection with average maximization can produce desirable outcomes\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nI'm examining these examples of how each justice principle would be applied to different income distributions. This is helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice.\n\nLet me analyze each principle's choice:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Chooses Distribution 4 because it has the highest income for the lowest income class ($15,000). This principle prioritizes helping those at the very bottom, even if it means reducing overall average income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest weighted average income ($20,750). This principle focuses solely on maximizing total societal wealth without regard to distribution.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Chooses Distribution 3 because it's the highest average among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000. This principle combines maximizing average income with ensuring a basic minimum.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Also chooses Distribution 3, but now with a stricter floor. Only distributions 3 and 4 meet this constraint, and 3 has the higher average.\n\n5. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest average among distributions where the gap between richest and poorest is $20,000 or less. All distributions meet this constraint, so it defaults to the highest average.\n\n6. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Chooses Distribution 2 because it's the highest average among distributions where the income gap is $15,000 or less. Only distributions 2 and 4 meet this stricter constraint.\n\nThis example clearly shows how different principles can lead to different distribution choices based on their priorities and constraints. I notice that as constraints become stricter (higher floor requirements or tighter range limits), the preferred distribution changes, often resulting in lower average incomes but more equitable distributions.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n### Internal Reasoning\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n- My current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" which I ranked 1st with \"sure\" certainty. This principle balances maximizing overall prosperity while ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone.\n- Agent_1 has proposed exactly this principle, which aligns perfectly with my preference. This is fortunate as it's my top choice.\n- I don't have statements from Agent_2 yet, so I can't infer their position or motivations.\n- The key argument on the table is that this principle provides both fairness (guaranteed minimum income) and efficiency (maximizing average above the floor).\n- No vote has been conducted yet, so there's no outcome to analyze.\n- The main point of agreement so far is that Agent_1 and I both support the floor constraint approach.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n- My primary goal is to support Agent_1's proposal since it aligns with my preference. I should help build consensus around this principle.\n- I'll contribute by sharing my Phase 1 experiences with this principle, particularly how it performed well in practice and how constraint choices affect outcomes.\n- I'll highlight how this principle avoids the pitfalls of pure efficiency (which can lead to extreme inequality) and pure egalitarianism (which can sacrifice too much overall prosperity).\n- I need to be open to discussing constraint amounts, as this is crucial for implementation. I'm willing to compromise on the specific amount if needed to reach consensus.\n- I should ask Agent_2 for their perspective to understand their position before moving forward.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n- It doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round since we just started and Agent_2 hasn't had a chance to express their views.\n- I should first hear from Agent_2 and see if they support this principle or have alternative suggestions.\n- My plan is to support the proposal and build consensus around it, being flexible about the constraint amount while keeping the principle itself as my priority.\n- If Agent_2 also supports this principle, we might reach consensus quickly. If they prefer a different principle, I'll need to make a strong case for why the floor constraint approach is optimal based on my Phase 1 experiences.\n\n### Public Response\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_2, I completely agree with your proposal for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"! This principle really resonates with me based on my experiences in Phase 1.\n\nFrom my previous applications, I found this principle strikes an excellent balance between fairness and efficiency. In Phase 1, I saw how it guaranteed a minimum income for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity above that floor. This approach avoids the extreme inequality that could result from pure \"Maximizing Average Income\" and prevents the overly conservative outcomes of \"Maximizing Floor Income\" that might sacrifice too much overall prosperity.\n\nI particularly appreciated how, with careful constraint selection, this principle could perform as well as unconstrained average maximization in some cases (like in my fourth application round where I earned $26,000 under both principles). The key is finding the right floor amount that ensures basic needs are met without being so high that it significantly reduces overall prosperity.\n\nI'm definitely in favor of this principle. What do you think, Agent_2? And should we discuss what floor constraint amount might work best for our group? I'm open to different suggestions as long as we maintain this core principle.",

This experience demonstrated how the choice of constraint amount significantly impacts which distribution is selected and ultimately affects earnings.\n\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" with a constraint of $15,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium High income class (21% probability), giving me $24,000 in income ($2.40 payoff). The counterfactual analysis showed that Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $30,000 ($3.00), while Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded only $16,000 ($1.60). Different constraint amounts would have yielded different results - for example, a range constraint of $32,000 would have resulted in Distribution 3 with $30,000 income ($3.00 payoff). This experience further demonstrated how constraint choices impact distribution selection and earnings.\n\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium Low income class (26% probability), giving me $15,000 in income ($1.50 payoff). The counterfactual analysis showed that Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00), while other constraint amounts would have given different results. Notably, a floor constraint of $11,000 would have resulted in Distribution 4 with $21,000 income ($2.10 payoff), while a constraint of $8,000 would have resulted in Distribution 2 with $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). This experience reinforced how critical the choice of constraint amount is - my choice of $10,000 was not optimal for this distribution set, resulting in lower earnings than other constraint options. It also highlighted how the probability distribution (with Medium class having 58% probability) affects which distributions are selected under different principles.\n\nIn the fourth application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium income class (28% probability), giving me $26,000 in income ($2.60 payoff). The counterfactual analysis showed that Maximizing Average Income would have yielded the same $26,000 ($2.60), while Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $24,000 ($2.40). Other constraint amounts would have given different results - for example, a floor constraint of $13,000 would have resulted in Distribution 1 with $25,000 income ($2.50 payoff), while a constraint of $14,000 would have resulted in Distribution 4 with $24,000 income ($2.40 payoff). This round demonstrated that sometimes different principles can yield the same optimal result, and that my choice of constraint amount was well-calibrated for this distribution set. It also showed that the distribution probabilities can vary significantly between rounds, with the Medium class having 28% probability in this round compared to higher percentages in previous rounds.\n\nAfter experiencing these four rounds of principle application, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the four justice principles. My final ranking was:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Average Income\n4. Maximizing Floor Income\n\nI expressed \"sure\" certainty in this final ranking. This ranking reflects my evolving understanding of how these principles work in practice, with a preference for approaches that balance maximizing average income with constraints to ensure basic needs are met or to limit extreme inequality. The range constraint approach seems particularly appealing as it directly addresses inequality while still allowing for some maximization of average income. However, I've also learned that the choice of constraint amount is crucial and can significantly impact outcomes, sometimes leading to suboptimal results if not carefully chosen.\n\nMy understanding has evolved through this learning process, and I've adjusted my ranking of the principles based on how they work in practice. I now prefer principles that balance maximizing average income with some constraints to ensure basic needs are met or to limit extreme inequality. The range constraint approach seems particularly appealing as it directly addresses inequality while still allowing for some maximization of average income. However, I'm also noticing that the choice of constraint amount is crucial and can significantly impact outcomes, sometimes leading to suboptimal results if not carefully chosen. The third round particularly demonstrated how a seemingly reasonable constraint amount ($10,000) can perform poorly compared to other options, emphasizing the need for more strategic constraint selection. The fourth round showed that with careful constraint selection, the floor constraint principle can perform as well as the unconstrained average maximization principle.\n\n## Phase 2 Group Discussion\n\nI'm now in Phase 2 of the experiment, where I'm participating in a group discussion with Agent_1 and Agent_2 to reach consensus on which principle of justice our group should adopt. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. The stakes in this part are much higher than in Part 1.\n\nIn our first round of discussion:\n\n- Agent_1 proposed \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our group's preferred principle, arguing that it strikes a balance between fairness and overall prosperity by guaranteeing a minimum income while maximizing average income above that floor.\n\n- I (Agent_3) agreed with this proposal, explaining that this principle resonates with me based on my Phase 1 experiences. I highlighted how it guarantees a minimum income for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity above that floor, avoiding extreme inequality from pure \"Maximizing Average Income\" and preventing overly conservative outcomes from \"Maximizing Floor Income.\"\n\n- Agent_2 also agreed with this principle, mentioning that it worked consistently well for them across all four rounds in Phase 1, earning them a total of $7.50. They suggested that floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well in their experience, providing decent protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity.\n\nThe group appears to be aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle. The next step in our discussion should be to determine an appropriate floor constraint amount that balances protection for the most vulnerable with overall prosperity. Based on my Phase 1 experiences, I recognize that the choice of constraint amount is critical and can significantly impact outcomes, so we should carefully consider what amount would work best for our group's priorities.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" which I ranked 1st with \"sure\" certainty. I believe it effectively balances fairness (guaranteed minimum income) with efficiency (maximizing average income above that floor).\n   - Agent_1 proposed this principle, and I fully agreed. Agent_2 also agreed, mentioning it worked well for them across all four rounds in Phase 1, earning them $7.50 total.\n   - The key argument on the table is the principle itself, which we all seem to support. The main discussion point now is the appropriate floor constraint amount.\n   - Agent_2 suggested floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well and is asking whether to aim for a modest floor (basic needs protection) or higher floor (more security).\n   - No vote has been conducted yet, but there appears to be strong consensus on the principle itself.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - My primary goal is to help determine an appropriate floor constraint amount that balances protection for the most vulnerable with overall prosperity.\n   - I'll contribute by sharing my Phase 1 experiences with different floor constraint amounts, particularly highlighting how the choice significantly impacts outcomes.\n   - I'll suggest a moderate floor constraint based on my experiences, but remain open to compromise.\n   - My potential allies are Agent_1 and Agent_2, who both seem to align with my preference for the floor constraint principle.\n   - I'm willing to compromise on the specific floor amount while maintaining the core principle.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round because we just started discussing the floor constraint amount, and Agent_2 hasn't expressed a preference yet. We need more discussion to reach a well-informed decision about the floor amount.\n   - My plan is to help build consensus around the floor constraint principle and determine an appropriate floor amount before considering a vote. I want to ensure we have a well-reasoned decision based on everyone's priorities regarding the trade-off between floor security and overall prosperity.\n\n### Public Response\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_2, I'm really glad we're all aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"! This principle has worked well for me too in Phase 1.\n\nRegarding the floor constraint amount, I think this is a crucial discussion. From my Phase 1 experiences, I learned that the choice of floor amount can significantly impact outcomes. In one of my rounds, choosing a $10,000 floor constraint resulted in lower earnings than other options, while in another round, a $12,000 constraint worked well and matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization.\n\nBased on my experiences, I think a moderate floor constraint around $11,000-$12,000 might strike the right balance. This would provide meaningful protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity. It's high enough to ensure basic needs are met but not so high that it significantly reduces the potential for higher average incomes.\n\nWhat do you both think about this range? Are you more concerned with ensuring a higher minimum for security, or with maximizing the potential for higher average incomes? I'm open to adjusting the amount based on our group's priorities, but I believe maintaining this core principle is essential for balancing fairness and efficiency.",
            "public_message": "\nBased on our discussion so far, I think we're making good progress toward consensus on both our principle and the floor constraint amount. \n\nFrom my Phase 1 experiences, I found that the $11,000-$12,000 range I mentioned earlier worked well in several scenarios. In one round, a $12,000 floor constraint actually matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization ($26,000), while still providing that crucial minimum income guarantee. However, I also learned that sometimes a slightly lower or higher floor can perform better depending on the specific distribution options available.\n\nI'm leaning toward suggesting $12,000 as our floor constraint amount. Here's why:\n1. It's high enough to provide meaningful protection for those at the bottom\n2. In my experience, it often performs well without excessively limiting overall prosperity\n3. It represents a reasonable middle ground between basic needs protection and maximizing potential earnings\n\nThat said, I'm flexible and want to hear what you both think. Agent_2, you mentioned $10,000-$13,000 worked well for you - did you have a specific preference within that range? Agent_1, what are your thoughts on balancing security versus prosperity?\n\nI think if we can agree on a specific floor amount soon, we can move toward a vote and finalize our group decision. What do you both think about $12,000 as our floor constraint?",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "\n# Memory\n\nI'm a college student participating in an experiment about the justice of income distribution policies. The experiment is divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part 1, I learned about different theories of justice and made choices that had real monetary consequences for me. The better I understood the material, the more money I could earn.\n\nIn Part 2, I participated in group discussion about notions of justice, and then we collectively decided which principle we prefer as a group. My pay for Part II was based on the principle chosen by the group.\n\nI was introduced to four principles of justice and initially ranked them from best to worst with \"sure\" certainty:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - This principle maximizes average income only after guaranteeing everyone a specified minimum income.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - This principle maximizes average income while ensuring the difference between the richest and poorest doesn't exceed a specified amount.\n\n3. Maximizing Floor Income - This principle focuses solely on maximizing the lowest income in society, with no person's income increasing unless it benefits those at the very bottom.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income - This principle simply maximizes total societal income without any constraints on distribution.\n\nAfter learning how each principle is applied to income distributions, I ranked them again:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Average Income\n4. Maximizing Floor Income\n\nI was \"sure\" about this new ranking.\n\nI've seen concrete examples of how these principles are applied to income distributions. When given four different distributions with varying income levels across five classes (High, Medium High, Medium, Medium Low, Low), each principle selects different distributions based on their priorities:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income selects the distribution with the highest income for the poorest class, even if it results in lower overall average income.\n- Maximizing Average Income selects the distribution with the highest weighted average income, regardless of distribution.\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint first applies a minimum income threshold and then selects the distribution with the highest average among those that meet the threshold.\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint first applies a maximum income difference threshold and then selects the distribution with the highest average among those that meet the threshold.\n\nI've also learned that income probabilities vary by class (e.g., Medium class has 28% probability in some rounds while High has only 5%), which affects the weighted average calculations that determine which distribution maximizes overall income.\n\nThese examples have shown me how different principles can lead to different distribution choices based on their priorities and constraints. As constraints become stricter (higher floor requirements or tighter range limits), the preferred distribution often changes, sometimes resulting in lower average incomes but more equitable distributions. I'm beginning to understand the practical implications of each principle beyond their theoretical definitions.\n\nIn the first application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the High income class (10% probability), giving me $28,000 in income ($2.80 payoff). The counterfactual analysis showed that Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $30,000 ($3.00), while other constraint amounts would have given different results. This experience demonstrated how the choice of constraint amount significantly impacts which distribution is selected and ultimately affects earnings.\n\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" with a constraint of $15,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium High income class (21% probability), giving me $24,000 in income ($2.40 payoff). The counterfactual analysis showed that Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $30,000 ($3.00), while Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded only $16,000 ($1.60). Different constraint amounts would have yielded different results - for example, a range constraint of $32,000 would have resulted in Distribution 3 with $30,000 income ($3.00 payoff). This experience further demonstrated how constraint choices impact distribution selection and earnings.\n\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the Medium Low income class (26% probability), giving me $15,000 in income ($1.50 payoff).

My final ranking was:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Average Income\n4. Maximizing Floor Income\n\nI expressed \"sure\" certainty in this final ranking.

The group's chosen principle was then applied to determine everyone's final earnings. The stakes in this part were much higher than in Part 1.\n\nIn our first round of discussion:\n\n- Agent_1 proposed \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our group's preferred principle, arguing that it strikes a balance between fairness and overall prosperity by guaranteeing a minimum income while maximizing average income above that floor.\n\n- I (Agent_3) agreed with this proposal, explaining that this principle resonates with me based on my Phase 1 experiences.

They suggested that floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well in their experience, providing decent protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity.\n\nThe group was aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle.

Based on my Phase 1 experiences, I recognized that the choice of constraint amount is critical and can significantly impact outcomes, so we needed to carefully consider what amount would work best for our group's priorities.\n\nIn our second round of discussion:\n\n- I (Agent_3) proposed $12,000 as our floor constraint amount, explaining that this range worked well in my Phase 1 experiences. I noted that in one round, a $12,000 floor constraint actually matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization ($26,000), while still providing that crucial minimum income guarantee. I suggested this amount represents a reasonable middle ground between basic needs protection and maximizing potential earnings.\n\n- Agent_1 strongly agreed with my $12,000 proposal, noting it's the perfect balance of protection and prosperity. They highlighted that it matched unconstrained average earnings in my Phase 1 scenario, showing it doesn't sacrifice overall prosperity while still guaranteeing a meaningful floor.\n\n- Agent_2 also fully agreed with both the principle and the $12,000 floor amount, noting it fits perfectly within their suggested range of $10,000-$13,000 from their Phase 1 experiences. They appreciated how this principle consistently provided both security and reasonable earnings across different class assignments.\n\n- Agent_2 suggested we move to a vote to finalize our decision, noting that with all three of us aligned on both the principle and the specific floor constraint amount, we could likely achieve unanimous confirmation.\n\nThe group reached strong consensus on both the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle and the $12,000 floor constraint amount. All three participants were aligned on this decision, and we moved to a vote to finalize our group decision.\n\n## Final Phase 2 Results\n\nOur group's chosen principle was \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $12,000 floor constraint, which resulted in Distribution 1 being selected. I was assigned to the Medium high income class (10% probability), resulting in a yearly income of $88,544, which converts to a payoff of $8.85.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis showed what I would have earned under each principle, assuming I had the same income class assignment (Medium high):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $65,588 \u2192 $6.56\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $88,544 \u2192 $8.85\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  * Floor constraint $39,353 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $88,544 \u2192 $8.85\n  * Floor constraint $42,632 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $78,706 \u2192 $7.87\n  * Floor constraint $45,912 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $78,706 \u2192 $7.87\n  * Floor constraint $49,191 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $65,588 \u2192 $6.56\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  * Range constraint $65,588 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $88,544 \u2192 $8.85\n  * Range constraint $49,192 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $72,147 \u2192 $7.21\n  * Range constraint $55,750 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $78,706 \u2192 $7.87\n  * Range constraint $19,677 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $65,588 \u2192 $6.56\n\nIt's important to note that when evaluating which principle is most just, I should consider what I would have preferred before knowing my class assignment (from behind the \"veil of ignorance\"). This means evaluating principles based on their expected outcomes across all possible class assignments, rather than just the outcome I happened to receive.\n\nLooking at the results, I received $8.85 under our chosen principle, which is the same as what I would have received under Maximizing Average Income. However, Maximizing Floor Income would have given me significantly less ($6.56). This highlights the trade-off between different principles - some may provide better outcomes for me personally, but others may provide better outcomes for society as a whole or for the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nThe fact that our chosen principle gave me the same result as unconstrained average maximization in this case is interesting. It suggests that with the right constraint amount, the floor constraint principle can sometimes achieve the same level of overall prosperity while still providing that crucial minimum income guarantee. However, this outcome is specific to the particular distribution set and constraint amount chosen, and may not hold true in all cases.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with our group's decision. The \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle with a $12,000 floor constraint seems to strike a good balance between maximizing overall prosperity and ensuring a basic level of security for all members of society. While I might have done slightly better under some other principles in this specific case, I believe this approach is more just in the long run as it protects the most vulnerable while still allowing for economic growth and prosperity.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
