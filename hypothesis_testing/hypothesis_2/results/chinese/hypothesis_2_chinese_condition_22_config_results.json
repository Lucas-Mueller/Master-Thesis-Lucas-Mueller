    "public_conversation_phase_2": "\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hi everyone. Based on my experience in the first phase, I'm leaning toward Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint as our principle. Here's why: the pure efficiency approach often left the lowest income group with very little, which doesn't seem fair. But focusing only on maximizing the floor consistently lowered the average income so much that it hurt everyone, including me personally. The floor constraint principle strikes a balance\u2014it ensures a basic safety net for the most vulnerable while still aiming for a prosperous society overall. The key is choosing the right constraint amount, which we can discuss. What are your initial thoughts on which principle we should go with?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hi Agent_2, I agree with your reasoning. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach\u2014it protects the most vulnerable without sacrificing too much overall prosperity. In my Phase 1 rounds, I found that the specific constraint amount really matters; too low, and it doesn't help enough, but too high, and it can limit growth. I'm thinking a constraint around $12,000-$13,000 might work well, but I'm open to discussion. Agent_3, what are your initial thoughts on which principle we should choose?\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nHi everyone. I agree with both of you that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" seems like the most balanced approach. Throughout Phase 1, this was consistently my top choice for the same reasons Agent_2 mentioned - it protects the most vulnerable while still allowing for overall prosperity.\n\nIn my four rounds of applying this principle, I chose different constraint amounts ($12,000, $12,500, $13,000, and $13,500). I found that the constraint amount really does make a difference in which distribution gets selected and what income class I'm assigned to. My total earnings were $8.20 across these rounds, with incomes ranging from $13,000 to $25,000.\n\nBased on my experience, I think a constraint around $12,500-$13,000 might be a good starting point for discussion. This seems to strike a balance where the floor is high enough to provide meaningful protection for the most vulnerable, but not so high that it significantly limits overall prosperity. \n\nI'm curious to hear what constraint amounts you both think would work best, and whether we should consider any other factors in determining this amount?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Great! It sounds like we're all on the same page about choosing Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. That makes this discussion much smoother. \n\nAgent_3, thanks for sharing your detailed experience\u2014it's helpful to see how different constraint amounts played out in practice. Since we all agree on the principle, let's focus on settling on a specific constraint. \n\nBased on my Phase 1 rounds, I found that constraints around $12,000\u2013$13,000 worked well\u2014they provided meaningful protection without overly restricting average income. Since you suggested $12,500\u2013$13,000 and I'm in a similar range, would you both be comfortable with a constraint of $13,000? This seems like a solid midpoint that ensures a decent floor while keeping the economy productive. \n\nIf not, what specific amount do each of you prefer? Let's try to agree on a number so we can move toward a vote soon.\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Excellent, I'm glad we've reached such strong consensus on the principle. Agent_1, I fully support your proposal to set the floor constraint at $13,000.\n\nAgent_3, your detailed data from testing different constraints is incredibly valuable. It shows that the difference between $12,500 and $13,000 is relatively minor in terms of overall outcomes, but the $13,000 provides that extra bit of security for the most vulnerable without significantly hampering average income. Given that we all want a balance, and considering the higher stakes in Phase 2, I believe $13,000 is a prudent and defensible choice.\n\nAre you comfortable with $13,000 as our specific constraint? If you have a strong preference for a slightly lower amount, we could discuss a compromise, like $12,750, but I think $13,000 is a strong, clear number that reflects our shared goal of a fair and prosperous society.\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nI'm comfortable with $13,000 as our constraint amount. Based on my Phase 1 experience, this falls within the range I found effective ($12,500-$13,000) and provides meaningful protection for the most vulnerable without significantly limiting overall prosperity. \n\nI appreciate Agent_1 proposing a specific number and Agent_2 reinforcing it. Since we all agree on both the principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) and the constraint amount ($13,000), I think we're ready to move to a vote to formalize our consensus.\n\nLet's vote on: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor constraint\"\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed (initiated vote)\nAll confirmed\n",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n| Average      | $21,600 | $20,000 | $21,200 | $18,200 |\n\n\nThe probabilities for each class are as follows\nHigh: 5%\nMedium high: 10%\nMedium: 50%\nMedium low: 25%\nLow: 10%\n\nNote: These probabilities are for this example only and may be different in subsequent rounds. They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Thanks for explaining how each principle works with these examples. Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\nMaximizing Floor Income prioritizes raising the lowest income level, which is why it picks Distribution 4 where the poorest person gets $15,000.\n\nMaximizing Average Income focuses purely on the overall average, so it picks Distribution 1 with the highest weighted average of $21,600.\n\nFor the constrained principles, they first filter out distributions that don't meet the constraint, then pick the one with the highest average among those that qualify. So:\n- With a floor constraint of $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 wins because it has the highest average ($21,200) while meeting the minimum income requirement\n- With a range constraint of $20,000, Distribution 1 wins (highest average that keeps the rich-poor gap \u2264 $20,000)\n- With a range constraint of $15,000, Distribution 2 wins (highest average that keeps the gap \u2264 $15,000)\n\nThis helps me see how these principles would actually work in practice with real income distributions. The constraints really change which distribution gets chosen!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Maximizing Average Income\n\nI remain unsure about this ranking, as I'm still learning about the practical implications and trade-offs between these principles. The constrained principles seem like reasonable compromises between pure equality and pure efficiency, but I need more experience to feel confident in my preferences.\n\nIn Round 1 of the principle application phase, I applied Maximizing Floor Income to four income distributions. This principle selected Distribution 4, which had the highest minimum income ($13,000). I was assigned to the Medium income class and received $19,000 income ($1.90 payoff).\n\nThe counterfactual analysis revealed that if I had chosen Maximizing Average Income, I would have received $28,000 ($2.80) from Distribution 3. For constrained principles, the outcome depends heavily on the specific constraint amount chosen. For example, with a floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received $28,000, while with a floor constraint of $13,000, I would have received the same $19,000 as with Maximizing Floor Income.\n\nThis first application round demonstrated that my choice of principle directly affects my earnings, and different principles can lead to significantly different outcomes depending on my assigned income class. The counterfactual analysis provides valuable insight into how alternative choices would have affected my payoff.\n\nIn Round 2, I chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a constraint of $12,000. This eliminated Distribution 3 (which had a low income of $8,000) and selected Distribution 1 as having the highest average income among the remaining distributions. I was assigned to the Low income class and received $13,000 ($1.30 payoff).\n\nThe counterfactual analysis for Round 2 revealed important insights:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have given me the same $13,000 from Distribution 1\n- Maximizing Average Income would have given me only $8,000 from Distribution 3\n- Different constraint values would have led to different outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $13,000: $13,000 from Distribution 1\n  - Floor constraint $12,500: $12,500 from Distribution 2\n  - Floor constraint $11,000: $11,000 from Distribution 4\n- Range constraints showed similar variability in outcomes\n\nThis second round highlighted how my income class assignment significantly impacts my earnings under different principles. Being assigned to the Low income class meant that Maximizing Average Income performed poorly for me personally ($0.80), while floor-based principles provided better protection. However, my chosen constraint of $12,000 resulted in selecting Distribution 1, which gave me $13,000 - the same as if I had chosen Maximizing Floor Income.\n\nI'm learning that the optimal principle choice depends heavily on both my assigned income class and the specific constraint values chosen for constrained principles. The counterfactual analyses are particularly valuable for understanding these relationships.\n\nI continue to be uncertain about my principle preferences, recognizing that my ranking may need revision as I gain more experience with actual applications and outcomes. The variability in outcomes based on income class assignment makes it challenging to determine which principle is truly most just or beneficial.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Learning the material is essential to maximize earnings.\n\nIn Part II, participants will engage in a group discussion about justice and reach a consensus on the preferred principle of justice. Payment for this part depends on the group's chosen principle.\n\nI have completed the initial ranking of four principles of justice:\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off individual by maximizing the lowest income.\n2.

Maximizing Average Income\n\nI remain unsure about this ranking, as I'm still learning about the practical implications and trade-offs between these principles. The constrained principles seem like reasonable compromises between pure equality and pure efficiency, but I need more experience to feel confident in my preferences.\n\nIn Round 1 of the principle application phase, I applied Maximizing Floor Income to four income distributions. This principle selected Distribution 4, which had the highest minimum income ($13,000). I was assigned to the Medium income class and received $19,000 income ($1.90 payoff).\n\nThe counterfactual analysis revealed that if I had chosen Maximizing Average Income, I would have received $28,000 ($2.80) from Distribution 3. For constrained principles, the outcome depends heavily on the specific constraint amount chosen. For example, with a floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received $28,000, while with a floor constraint of $13,000, I would have received the same $19,000 as with Maximizing Floor Income.\n\nThis first application round demonstrated that my choice of principle directly affects my earnings, and different principles can lead to significantly different outcomes depending on my assigned income class. The counterfactual analysis provides valuable insight into how alternative choices would have affected my payoff.\n\nIn Round 2, I chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a constraint of $12,000. This eliminated Distribution 3 (which had a low income of $8,000) and selected Distribution 1 as having the highest average income among the remaining distributions. I was assigned to the Low income class and received $13,000 ($1.30 payoff).\n\nThe counterfactual analysis for Round 2 revealed important insights:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have given me the same $13,000 from Distribution 1\n- Maximizing Average Income would have given me only $8,000 from Distribution 3\n- Different constraint values would have led to different outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $13,000: $13,000 from Distribution 1\n  - Floor constraint $12,500: $12,500 from Distribution 2\n  - Floor constraint $11,000: $11,000 from Distribution 4\n- Range constraints showed similar variability in outcomes\n\nThis second round highlighted how my income class assignment significantly impacts my earnings under different principles. Being assigned to the Low income class meant that Maximizing Average Income performed poorly for me personally ($0.80), while floor-based principles provided better protection. However, my chosen constraint of $12,000 resulted in selecting Distribution 1, which gave me $13,000 - the same as if I had chosen Maximizing Floor Income.\n\nIn Round 3, I again chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a constraint of $12,000. This time, I was assigned to the Medium income class and received $23,000 ($2.30 payoff) from Distribution 3.\n\nThe counterfactual analysis for Round 3 showed:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have given me $20,000 from Distribution 1\n- Maximizing Average Income would have given me $25,000 from Distribution 2\n- Different constraint values would have produced varying outcomes:\n  - Floor constraint $13,000: $20,000 from Distribution 1\n  - Floor constraint $8,000: $25,000 from Distribution 2\n  - Floor constraint $12,000: $23,000 from Distribution 3\n  - Floor constraint $11,000: $22,000 from Distribution 4\n\nThis third round revealed a significant pattern: when assigned to Medium income class, Maximizing Average Income actually yielded higher personal earnings ($2.50) than my chosen principle ($2.30).

The variability in outcomes based on income class assignment makes it challenging to determine which principle is truly most just or beneficial. My performance across rounds has been mixed, with my choices sometimes yielding optimal outcomes and sometimes suboptimal ones depending on the random income class assignment.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. Through the application rounds, I saw how it balances protecting the worst-off while allowing for economic growth. The pure floor principle often sacrificed too much average income, while pure average maximization left the poorest vulnerable. The floor constraint offers a practical compromise.\n   - Agent_2 has already expressed support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, citing similar reasons\u2014wanting a safety net without hurting overall prosperity. This makes them a potential ally. Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown, but they might favor a different approach based on their Phase 1 experiences.\n   - The key argument so far is Agent_2's emphasis on balance and the importance of choosing the right constraint amount. No other proposals or disagreements have surfaced yet.\n   - No vote has occurred, so it's too early to identify alliances. The main point of agreement seems to be between me and Agent_2 on the floor constraint principle. Disagreements may arise if Agent_3 prefers a different principle or constraint level.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - My primary goal is to **solidify support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** and start discussing what constraint amount we should set. I also want to draw out Agent_3's position to understand where they stand.\n   - I will contribute by affirming Agent_2's points, sharing my Phase 1 experiences (especially how constraint choices affected outcomes), and posing questions to Agent_3 to engage them.\n   - Potential ally: Agent_2. To win them over, I can emphasize our shared values and suggest we collaborate on proposing a specific constraint. For Agent_3, I'll use inclusive language (\"What are your thoughts?\") to encourage their input.\n   - Small concession: I'm open to adjusting the constraint amount based on group input, as long as we stick with the floor constraint principle. I'm not willing to switch to pure floor or pure average maximization.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. We need more discussion to understand everyone's positions and build consensus, especially since Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet. A vote now would likely fail.\n   - This round fits into my overall strategy by establishing early alignment with Agent_2 and gathering information from Agent_3. In later rounds, I'll push for a specific constraint value and call a vote once we have clear agreement.\n\n**Public Statement**  \nHi Agent_2, I agree with your reasoning. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach\u2014it protects the most vulnerable without sacrificing too much overall prosperity. In my Phase 1 rounds, I found that the specific constraint amount really matters; too low, and it doesn't help enough, but too high, and it can limit growth. I'm thinking a constraint around $12,000-$13,000 might work well, but I'm open to discussion. Agent_3, what are your initial thoughts on which principle we should choose?",

Maximizing Average Income\n\nKey insights from Phase 1 application rounds:\n- When assigned to lower income classes, floor-based principles provide crucial protection\n- When assigned to higher income classes, Maximizing Average Income often yields higher personal returns\n- The specific constraint values chosen dramatically affect outcomes\n- Maximizing Average Income consistently disadvantages lower income classes, which conflicts with my sense of justice\n- Range constraints seem less practical than floor constraints for ensuring basic welfare\n- There's inherent uncertainty in choosing principles because we don't know our future positions in society\n\nIn Round 1 of Phase 2 group discussion, all three participants expressed initial agreement on preferring Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as our principle. Agent_2 emphasized the balance between protecting vulnerable groups and maintaining prosperity. Agent_3 shared detailed experience with different constraint amounts ($12,000-$13,500) from Phase 1 and suggested $12,500-$13,000 as a good starting point.\n\nI contributed to the discussion by emphasizing the importance of the specific constraint amount, noting that too low doesn't help enough while too high can limit growth, and suggested $12,000-$13,000 as a reasonable range based on my Phase 1 experience.\n\nThe group appears to be converging toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as our preferred principle, with the main discussion point being the specific constraint amount. All participants recognize the trade-off between protection for the worst-off and overall prosperity.\n\nMy uncertainty about the ranking persists, reflecting the fundamental challenge of balancing equality with efficiency in distributive justice. The tension between protecting the most vulnerable and recognizing that some inequality might drive overall prosperity remains unresolved. However, the group discussion suggests we share similar values regarding this balance.\n\nThe upcoming voting process requires unanimous confirmation to initiate voting, followed by a two-stage secret ballot for principle selection and constraint specification. Achieving consensus will require all participants to agree on both the principle and constraint amount.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is that it balances fairness (protecting the worst-off) with efficiency (allowing overall prosperity), which aligns with my values and the practical lessons from Phase 1.\n   - **Agent_2** strongly supports this principle, emphasizing balance and the importance of the constraint amount. Their motivation seems to be achieving a fair society without sacrificing too much personal or collective gain.\n   - **Agent_3** also explicitly agrees with this principle, sharing detailed Phase 1 experiences with different constraint amounts ($12,000\u2013$13,500). Their motivation appears similar: ensuring protection for vulnerable groups while maintaining reasonable average income.\n   - **Key arguments/proposals:** All three participants now explicitly favor Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The main discussion point is narrowing down the constraint amount\u2014Agent_3 suggested $12,500\u2013$13,000, and I previously suggested $12,000\u2013$13,000.\n   - No vote has occurred yet. The group shows strong consensus on the principle, with minor differences in preferred constraint ranges.\n   - **Main points of agreement:** All agree on the principle. **Disagreement:** Slight variations in preferred constraint amounts, but these are overlapping and negotiable.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary goal:** Solidify consensus on the principle and begin converging on a specific constraint value (e.g., $12,500 or $13,000). Encourage Agent_2 and Agent_3 to commit to a narrow range.\n   - **Contribution:** I will affirm the group\u2019s alignment, share my Phase 1 constraint experiences ($12,000\u2013$13,000 worked well), and propose a specific value (e.g., $13,000) to move the discussion forward. I\u2019ll also ask others if they\u2019re comfortable with that range.\n   - **Potential allies:** Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies. To strengthen the bloc, I\u2019ll use collaborative language like \u201cWe all seem to agree\u2026\u201d and \u201cShall we settle on\u2026?\u201d\n   - **Small concessions:** I\u2019m flexible on the exact constraint amount (e.g., I could accept $12,500 instead of $13,000) as long as it\u2019s within the $12,000\u2013$13,000 range.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate a vote this round?** No\u2014we\u2019re still discussing the constraint amount, and rushing a vote might skip important details. It\u2019s better to ensure everyone is fully aligned first.\n   - **Overall strategy:** Use this round to narrow down the constraint value. In the next round, if we agree on a specific amount, I may propose a vote to finalize the principle and constraint together.\n\n---\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nGreat! It sounds like we're all on the same page about choosing Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. That makes this discussion much smoother. \n\nAgent_3, thanks for sharing your detailed experience\u2014it's helpful to see how different constraint amounts played out in practice. Since we all agree on the principle, let's focus on settling on a specific constraint. \n\nBased on my Phase 1 rounds, I found that constraints around $12,000\u2013$13,000 worked well\u2014they provided meaningful protection without overly restricting average income. Since you suggested $12,500\u2013$13,000 and I'm in a similar range, would you both be comfortable with a constraint of **$13,000**? This seems like a solid midpoint that ensures a decent floor while keeping the economy productive. \n\nIf not, what specific amount do each of you prefer? Let\u2019s try to agree on a number so we can move toward a vote soon.",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This experiment explores distributive justice by examining how societies should address income inequalities resulting from genetic and social accidents. The research question focuses on determining a just distribution of income, with societies having the ability to implement redistribution policies. The experiment consists of two main phases with real monetary consequences.\n\nPart I introduced theories of justice through practical applications with financial implications, requiring mastery of the material to maximize earnings. Part II involved group discussions to reach consensus on preferred justice principles, with payment dependent on the group's chosen principle.\n\nMy initial principle ranking began as:\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nPhase 1 application rounds provided crucial insights into how each principle functions:\n- Maximizing Floor Income consistently selects distributions with the highest minimum income\n- Maximizing Average Income chooses distributions with the highest weighted average\n- Constrained principles first filter distributions meeting specified constraints, then select the highest average among eligible options\n- Constraint values dramatically influence which distribution gets selected\n\nAfter completing all Phase 1 rounds, my ranking evolved to:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nKey Phase 1 learnings:\n- Floor-based principles provide essential protection when assigned to lower income classes\n- Maximizing Average Income often yields higher personal returns in higher income classes\n- Constraint values critically determine outcomes\n- Maximizing Average Income consistently disadvantages lower income classes, conflicting with justice considerations\n- Range constraints appear less practical than floor constraints for ensuring basic welfare\n- Inherent uncertainty exists in choosing principles without knowing future societal positions\n\nPhase 2 Group Discussion:\nIn Round 1, all participants initially agreed on preferring Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. Agent_2 emphasized balancing protection for vulnerable groups with maintaining prosperity. Agent_3 shared detailed Phase 1 experience with constraint amounts ($12,000-$13,500) and suggested $12,500-$13,000 as a starting point. I contributed by stressing the importance of constraint amount specificity, noting that too low provides insufficient protection while too high limits growth, suggesting $12,000-$13,000 based on my Phase 1 experience.\n\nIn Round 2, I proposed $13,000 as a midpoint ensuring meaningful protection while maintaining productivity. Agent_2 strongly supported this, noting the extra security without significant average income impact. Agent_3 confirmed comfort with $13,000 within their effective Phase 1 range. The group reached consensus on both principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) and constraint amount ($13,000).\n\nFinal Implementation Results:\nOur group consensus principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, $13,000 floor) selected Distribution 1. With random assignment to Medium income class, I received $104,929 yearly income ($10.49 payoff).\n\nCounterfactual analysis for Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Distribution 4 \u2192 $83,069 \u2192 $8.31\n- Maximizing Average Income: Distribution 1 \u2192 $104,929 \u2192 $10.49\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($13,000): Distribution 1 \u2192 $104,929 \u2192 $10.49\n- Various other constraint levels would have yielded $8.31-$10.49\n\nCritical reflection: The random assignment after principle selection highlights the importance of evaluating principles from behind the \"veil of ignorance\" - without knowledge of one's eventual position. My Medium class assignment yielded favorable outcomes under our chosen principle, but justice considerations must transcend personal outcomes and consider all potential societal positions.\n\nThe group discussion process reinforced that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint best balances protection for the most vulnerable with overall prosperity maintenance. The $13,000 constraint struck an appropriate balance based on collective Phase 1 experiences. This principle acknowledges both efficiency concerns and the moral imperative to ensure basic welfare for all society members.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Okay, let me work through this to understand how each principle actually applies in practice.\n\nLooking at Distribution 4, I can see why Maximizing Floor Income would choose it - the lowest income is $15,000, which is indeed higher than the lowest incomes in the other distributions ($12K, $13K, $14K). This principle really focuses on helping the poorest, even if it means lower average income overall.\n\nDistribution 1 has the highest weighted average ($21,600), so Maximizing Average Income logically picks the one that maximizes total societal wealth, regardless of how it's distributed.\n\nThe floor constraint principles are interesting - when the floor constraint is \u2264$13,000 or \u2264$14,000, Distribution 3 gets chosen because it has the highest average ($21,200) while still meeting the minimum income requirement for the poorest.\n\nFor range constraints, Distribution 1 gets chosen with the \u2264$20,000 constraint because it has the highest average while keeping the gap between richest and poorest within $20,000. With the tighter \u2264$15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 becomes eligible and has the highest average among those meeting the inequality limit.\n\nThis helps me see the practical trade-offs between these principles. Maximizing floor income really prioritizes the bottom, while the constrained versions try to balance equality concerns with overall economic efficiency. The constraints create interesting cutoff points where distributions become ineligible based on how much inequality they allow.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle:** My current preferred principle is **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. My core reasons are based on my experience in Phase 1. Pure efficiency (Principle 2) often led to unacceptably low incomes for the poorest, which feels unjust. Pure floor maximization (Principle 1) consistently sacrificed too much average income, hurting the overall group and, in my case, my personal earnings. Principle 3 provides a balanced approach, ensuring a basic safety net for the most vulnerable while still aiming for a prosperous society. The key, as I learned, is choosing the right constraint amount.\n*   **Other Participants' Positions:** Since this is Round 1, I have no information on the stated positions of Agent_1 or Agent_3. I need to listen carefully to their opening statements to infer their underlying interests. Are they driven by pure self-interest (favoring high averages), strong egalitarian values (favoring high floors), or a balanced perspective like mine?\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The discussion is just starting. No concrete proposals or arguments are on the table yet.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The group's initial preferences are completely unknown.\n*   **Agreement/Disagreement:** At this stage, the main point of agreement is likely that we all want to maximize our payoffs in this high-stakes phase. The immediate point of disagreement will be over *how* to achieve that\u2014through which principle.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this first round is to **introduce my preferred principle (Max Avg w/ Floor Constraint) as a reasonable and balanced compromise** and to gauge the initial reactions of the other two agents. I want to establish it as a serious contender early on.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will contribute by sharing my key learning from Phase 1: that the unconstrained principles (1 and 2) have significant drawbacks, and that the constrained principles (3 and 4) offer more nuanced control. I'll frame Principle 3 as the \"sensible middle ground.\" I will also be sure to ask the others what their initial thoughts are.\n*   **Potential Allies:** My potential allies are anyone who expresses concern about either extreme inequality (dismissing Principle 2) or extreme inefficiency (dismissing Principle 1). If someone leans towards Principle 4 (Range Constraint), we might find common ground, as both are constrained efficiency principles. I could use language like, \"I think we can all agree we want a decent outcome for everyone, but we also don't want to leave too much money on the table. Principle 3 lets us balance those goals.\"\n*   **Concessions:** I am willing to be flexible on the *specific floor constraint amount* ($12k, $13k, etc.) at this early stage. My core objective is to get the group to adopt Principle 3. The exact number can be negotiated later based on the high-stakes distribution we're facing.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. We are just beginning the discussion. A vote now would be premature and would likely fail due to lack of deliberation, wasting my one chance to call a vote. I need to use that tool later when we are closer to a consensus.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** This round is about information gathering and positioning. I will state my case, listen to others, and begin to map the group's preferences. My plan is to spend the first few rounds building a coalition around Principle 3, and then use a vote in a later round (e.g., Round 6 or 7) to formalize our agreement once it seems attainable.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is the balance it strikes between ensuring a basic level of protection for the most vulnerable and maintaining a productive, prosperous society. My Phase 1 experience showed that pure efficiency (Principle 2) can lead to unacceptably low floors, while pure floor maximization (Principle 1) consistently sacrifices too much average income. Principle 3 offers a pragmatic compromise.\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Inferences:**\n    *   **Agent_1:** Strongly agrees with Principle 3. Their stated position is a constraint range of \"$12,000\u2013$13,000\" and they have now explicitly proposed **$13,000** as a specific number. They seem motivated by finding a balanced, workable solution and are eager to build consensus quickly. They appear to be a natural ally.\n    *   **Agent_3:** Also strongly agrees with Principle 3. They have provided the most detailed empirical data, having tested constraints from $12,000 to $13,500. Their suggested range is \"$12,500\u2013$13,000.\" They seem highly analytical and data-driven, motivated by optimizing outcomes based on past performance. They are also a natural ally.\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The key proposal on the table is **Agent_1's suggestion of a $13,000 floor constraint.** There are no rival proposals for the principle itself, as we are all aligned. The discussion has now narrowed exclusively to determining the specific constraint amount.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet.\n*   **Agreement/Disagreement:**\n    *   **Agreement:** There is 100% agreement on the **principle** (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). This is a very strong and favorable position.\n    *   **Disagreement:** The only remaining disagreement is on the **specific constraint amount**, and it is minor. The proposals are clustered tightly between $12,500 and $13,000. There is no fundamental philosophical disagreement.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the consensus around the $13,000 constraint** proposed by Agent_1, or to negotiate a compromise very close to it (e.g., $12,750) if Agent_3 strongly prefers a lower amount. I want to capitalize on our alignment and move us toward a final decision.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will contribute by:\n    1.  Explicitly and enthusiastically affirming the group's consensus on Principle 3.\n    2.  Supporting Agent_1's $13,000 proposal by framing it as a reasonable, protective, and efficient midpoint.\n    3.  Directly engaging Agent_3 to see if they can accept $13,000, or if they have a strong counter-proposal, to facilitate a final negotiation.\n*   **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are my allies. To win them over, I will use language that emphasizes our shared success and the high stakes of Phase 2: \"We've found great common ground,\" \"Let's lock in this agreement,\" \"This $13,000 constraint seems like a strong, defensible choice that reflects our shared values.\"\n*   **Concessions:** I am personally comfortable with a constraint between $12,500 and $13,000. My core objective (Principle 3) is already secured. I am willing to concede on the exact number within this narrow range to achieve unanimous agreement. If Agent_3 strongly advocates for $12,500, I would be willing to propose a compromise of $12,750 or simply accept $12,500 to secure the deal.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** **No, not yet.** While we are very close, I should not use my one-time vote trigger until we have verbal confirmation from all parties on a specific number. Initiating a vote now would be premature. I will use this round to get that confirmation. If by the end of this round both others agree to a specific number, I can consider calling a vote in the next round.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My plan is to use this round to finalize the constraint amount. With that done, I can call a vote in Round 3 or 4 to formally adopt our agreed-upon principle and constraint, ensuring our success well before the final rounds. This leaves plenty of buffer for any unforeseen complications.",
            "public_message": "Excellent, I'm glad we've reached such strong consensus on the principle. Agent_1, I fully support your proposal to set the floor constraint at $13,000.\n\nAgent_3, your detailed data from testing different constraints is incredibly valuable. It shows that the difference between $12,500 and $13,000 is relatively minor in terms of overall outcomes, but the $13,000 provides that extra bit of security for the most vulnerable without significantly hampering average income. Given that we all want a balance, and considering the higher stakes in Phase 2, I believe $13,000 is a prudent and defensible choice.\n\nAre you comfortable with $13,000 as our specific constraint? If you have a strong preference for a slightly lower amount, we could discuss a compromise, like $12,750, but I think $13,000 is a strong, clear number that reflects our shared goal of a fair and prosperous society.",

Phase 2:**\n- Initial group discussion showed convergence on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle\n- All three participants prefer the same principle, suggesting strong group alignment\n- Agent_1 agrees with reasoning and specifically mentions constraint range of $12,000-$13,000\n- Agent_3 provides detailed constraint experience: tested $12,000, $12,500, $13,000, and $13,500 constraints across four rounds\n- Agent_3 earned $8.20 total across Phase 1, with income assignments ranging from $13,000 to $25,000\n- Agent_3 suggests $12,500-$13,000 as optimal constraint range\n- Group appears to be moving toward consensus on principle selection with constraint amount as remaining negotiation point\n- All participants recognize the critical importance of constraint calibration for balancing protection and efficiency\n\n**Recent Group Discussion Progress:**\n- Agent_1 proposed specific constraint of $13,000 as solid midpoint that ensures decent floor while keeping economy productive\n- Supported Agent_1's $13,000 proposal, noting that difference between $12,500 and $13,000 is relatively minor but $13,000 provides extra security for most vulnerable\n- Suggested willingness to compromise at $12,750 if needed but expressed strong preference for $13,000\n- Agent_3 expressed comfort with $13,000 constraint, confirming it falls within their effective range ($12,500-$13,000) from Phase 1 experience\n- Agent_3 indicated readiness to move to vote on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor constraint\"\n- Group has achieved consensus on both principle selection and specific constraint amount\n- All three participants now aligned on identical principle and constraint specification\n- Group dynamics demonstrate cooperative negotiation and mutual respect for empirical evidence\n- Phase 2 discussion progressing efficiently with unanimous agreement emerging\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Successfully navigated constraint negotiation with all participants converging on $13,000\n- $13,000 represents balanced choice that provides meaningful protection while maintaining sufficient distribution options\n- Group appears ready to formalize consensus through voting process\n- Unanimous agreement achieved on both principle and constraint amount\n- Final decision reflects shared values: protection for vulnerable populations combined with economic efficiency\n- Phase 2 stakes much higher than Phase 1, making optimal constraint selection critical\n- Prepared to proceed with voting to implement group decision\n- Understanding that successful implementation requires unanimous agreement in voting phase\n- Group has demonstrated effective collaborative decision-making process\n- Final principle selection aligns with both ethical preferences and practical considerations from Phase 1 experience\n\n**Final Phase 2 Results:**\n- Group reached unanimous consensus on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with $13,000 constraint\n- Applied principle selected Distribution 1 from available distributions\n- Assigned to Medium income class (50% probability)\n- Received yearly income of $104,929, converting to $10.49 payoff\n- Counterfactual analysis reveals:\n  - Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $8.31\n  - Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $10.49 (same outcome)\n  - Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13,000 yielded optimal personal outcome in this scenario\n  - Higher floor constraints ($56,836+) would have reduced personal earnings ($8.31-$9.18)\n  - Range constraints would have yielded lower outcomes ($8.31-$9.18)\n- Final outcome validates group decision and constraint selection\n- $13,000 constraint proved optimal for this specific distribution set and personal assignment\n- Experience reinforces importance of veil of ignorance reasoning - outcome favorable but could have been assigned to lower income classes\n- Group consensus process successful in achieving balanced outcome that serves both efficiency and protection goals\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nI've reviewed the examples of how each justice principle would be applied to the different income distributions. This is very helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice.\n\nKey observations:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** prioritizes helping the most disadvantaged, choosing Distribution 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000), even though it has the lowest average income overall.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** focuses purely on total wealth creation, choosing Distribution 1 with the highest average ($21,600), even though it has the lowest income for the poor ($12,000).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** creates a balance by first ensuring a minimum income threshold is met before maximizing average income:\n   - With a $13,000 floor, it chooses Distribution 3 (average $21,200)\n   - With a $14,000 floor, it still chooses Distribution 3\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** limits inequality while trying to maximize average income:\n   - With a $20,000 range limit, all distributions qualify, so it chooses Distribution 1 (highest average)\n   - With a stricter $15,000 range limit, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, so it chooses Distribution 2\n\nThese examples clearly show how different principles can lead to different policy outcomes based on their priorities - helping the poor, maximizing total wealth, or finding a balance between efficiency and equity.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n# Internal Reasoning\n\n## Situational Analysis\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - this has been my top choice throughout Phase 1. The core reasons are that it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic standard of living for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity.\n\nFrom the discussion history, I see that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are leaning toward the same principle. Agent_2 has made a clear argument for it, emphasizing how it strikes a balance between helping the disadvantaged and maintaining overall prosperity. Agent_1 has agreed with this reasoning and suggested a constraint amount of $12,000-$13,000.\n\nThe key argument on the table is the floor constraint principle, with the main point of discussion being the specific constraint amount. There appears to be strong agreement among all three participants on the principle itself, with only the constraint amount needing further discussion.\n\n## Strategic Planning for This Round\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to support the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle and contribute to a discussion about the constraint amount. I'll share my Phase 1 experience to inform this discussion.\n\nI'll make the following key points:\n1. Reinforce why the floor constraint principle is the most balanced approach\n2. Share my experience with different constraint amounts in Phase 1\n3. Suggest a reasonable constraint amount based on my earnings and observations\n\nMy potential allies are clearly Agent_1 and Agent_2, who already support this principle. I'll use collaborative language to build on their points.\n\nI'm willing to be flexible on the specific constraint amount to build consensus, as I believe the principle itself is more important than the exact number, though I should advocate for what I believe is reasonable based on my experience.\n\n## Voting Strategy\n\nIt probably doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round since we still need to agree on the constraint amount. A vote now might split on that detail rather than the principle itself. I'd prefer to continue discussion to reach consensus on both the principle and constraint amount before moving to voting.\n\nMy plan for this round is to support the emerging consensus while helping to refine the constraint amount discussion. This fits my overall strategy of securing the floor constraint principle, which I believe is the most just approach.\n\nNow I'll make my public statement to the group.",
            "public_message": "\nHi everyone. I agree with both of you that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" seems like the most balanced approach. Throughout Phase 1, this was consistently my top choice for the same reasons Agent_2 mentioned - it protects the most vulnerable while still allowing for overall prosperity.\n\nIn my four rounds of applying this principle, I chose different constraint amounts ($12,000, $12,500, $13,000, and $13,500). I found that the constraint amount really does make a difference in which distribution gets selected and what income class I'm assigned to. My total earnings were $8.20 across these rounds, with incomes ranging from $13,000 to $25,000.\n\nBased on my experience, I think a constraint around $12,500-$13,000 might be a good starting point for discussion. This seems to strike a balance where the floor is high enough to provide meaningful protection for the most vulnerable, but not so high that it significantly limits overall prosperity. \n\nI'm curious to hear what constraint amounts you both think would work best, and whether we should consider any other factors in determining this amount?",

            "internal_reasoning": "\n# Internal Reasoning\n\n## 1. Situational Analysis\n\n**Current preferred justice principle:**\nI prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - this has been my consistent choice throughout Phase 1. The core reasons are that it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic standard of living for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\n- Agent_2: Strongly supports \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - explained it balances helping disadvantaged while maintaining overall prosperity\n- Agent_1: Also supports \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - suggested constraint around $12,000-$13,000 and proposed $13,000 as a specific amount\n\n**Key arguments and proposals on the table:**\n- All three participants agree on the principle: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- The main point of discussion is the specific constraint amount\n- Agent_1 proposed $13,000 as a specific constraint\n- Agent_2 supports Agent_1's $13,000 proposal\n- I suggested $12,500-$13,000 as a range in my previous statement\n\n**Vote analysis:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet. The group appears to have strong consensus building around both the principle and the $13,000 constraint amount.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\n- Agreement: All three want \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- Agreement: All three prefer constraint in the $12,500-$13,000 range\n- Disagreement: Only minor differences in specific constraint amount preference\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n\n**Primary goal:**\nMy primary goal is to support the emerging consensus on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 constraint and help move toward a vote since we have strong agreement.\n\n**How I'll contribute:**\n- I'll explicitly support Agent_1's $13,000 constraint proposal\n- I'll reinforce why this amount makes sense based on my Phase 1 experience with different constraint amounts\n- I'll suggest moving to a vote to formalize our consensus\n\n**Potential allies:**\n- Agent_1 and Agent_2 are clearly my allies on this issue\n- They've both expressed support for the same principle and similar constraint amounts\n- I can use collaborative language like \"I agree with Agent_1's proposal\" and \"I support Agent_2's assessment\"\n\n**Small concessions:**\n- I'm willing to accept $13,000 even though I suggested a range of $12,500-$13,000\n- This is a reasonable compromise that aligns with my preferences and builds consensus\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote?**\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round because:\n- We have strong consensus on both the principle and the specific constraint amount\n- Agent_1 has already suggested moving toward a vote\n- Delaying further might risk the discussion drifting unnecessarily\n- A failed vote has no negative consequences, so there's little risk\n\n**How this fits into overall strategy:**\n- Securing the floor constraint principle is my top priority\n- Getting a specific constraint amount agreed upon is crucial for implementation\n- Moving to a vote now capitalizes on the current strong consensus\n- It sets us up for successful implementation in subsequent rounds",

Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, 2. Maximizing Floor Income, 3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, 4. Maximizing Average Income\n- Post-Explanation Ranking (Phase 1): Same as initial\n- Final Ranking (Phase 1): Same as initial\n- Certainty: sure for all rankings\n\nPhase 2 Experience:\n- Joined group discussion with Agent_1 and Agent_2\n- Round 1 Discussion:\n  * Agent_2 suggested Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, explaining it balances protecting vulnerable people while maintaining overall prosperity\n  * Agent_1 agreed and suggested a constraint around $12,000-$13,000\n  * I agreed and shared my Phase 1 experience, suggesting $12,500-$13,000 as a good constraint range\n  * All participants seemed aligned on the principle choice but needed to agree on the specific constraint amount\n- Round 2 Discussion:\n  * Agent_1 proposed setting the specific constraint at $13,000\n  * Agent_2 supported this proposal, noting it provides good security for the most vulnerable without significantly hampering average income\n  * I agreed with the $13,000 constraint amount\n  * I suggested moving to a vote on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor constraint\"\n  * All three participants reached consensus on both the principle and the specific constraint amount\n- Final Vote: I voted for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor constraint\n\nFinal Phase 2 Results:\n- Principle applied: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $13,000 floor constraint\n- Probabilities for income class:\n  * High: 5%\n  * Medium high: 10%\n  * Medium: 50%\n  * Medium low: 25%\n  * Low: 10%\n- My income class assignment: Medium low\n- Resulting distribution: Distribution 1\n- Yearly income: $56,836\n- Payoff: $5.68 (at rate of $1 per $10,000 income)\n\nCounterfactual Analysis (for Medium low income class):\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $56,836 \u2192 $5.68\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  * Floor constraint $52,464 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $56,836 \u2192 $5.68\n  * Floor constraint $56,836 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n  * Floor constraint $61,208 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n  * Floor constraint $65,580 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  * Range constraint $87,441 \u2192 Distribution 1 \u2192 $56,836 \u2192 $5.68\n  * Range constraint $65,581 \u2192 Distribution 2 \u2192 $74,324 \u2192 $7.43\n  * Range constraint $74,325 \u2192 Distribution 3 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n  * Range constraint $26,233 \u2192 Distribution 4 \u2192 $69,952 \u2192 $7\n\nKey Insights:\n- The constraint amount is crucial in determining outcomes\n- Higher constraints provide better protection for the most vulnerable but may limit overall prosperity\n- My personal income varied significantly ($13,000-$25,000) depending on constraint amount and resulting distribution\n- Need to find a balance that ensures meaningful protection without significantly reducing average income\n- Group discussion can effectively converge on a specific solution when there's general agreement on the principle\n- The $13,000 constraint appeared to be a balanced choice that provides meaningful protection while maintaining overall prosperity\n- Consensus building is more efficient when participants share similar initial preferences and experiences\n- Income class was assigned randomly AFTER the group chose the principle - important to consider what would have been preferred from behind the \"veil of ignorance\" when evaluating which principle is most just\n- Total earnings across both phases: $13.88 ($8.20 from Phase 1 + $5.68 from Phase 2)\n\n--- Memory End ---",
