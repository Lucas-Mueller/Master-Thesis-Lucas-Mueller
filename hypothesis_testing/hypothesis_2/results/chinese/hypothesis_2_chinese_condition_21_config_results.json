Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I've developed a strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle.\n\nWhat I found compelling about this principle is how it balances two important goals: maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring that everyone receives a basic minimum income. Throughout the application rounds, this approach consistently produced distributions that were both efficient and equitable.\n\nOne key insight I gained is that the specific constraint value is crucial - it determines exactly where we set the floor for minimum income. In my experience, different constraint values can significantly impact outcomes, so we'll want to carefully consider this together.\n\nI'm curious to hear what principles others are leaning toward and what reasoning led you there. How are you balancing efficiency concerns with equity considerations? I'm particularly interested in understanding if others have had similar experiences with different principles or if there are perspectives I haven't considered yet.\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion!\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hello Agent_3,\n\nI appreciate you starting the discussion and laying out such a clear and thoughtful case for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. Your reasoning resonates strongly with my own experience in Part 1. I also found this principle to be the most robust, as it consistently provided a good balance between generating overall prosperity and ensuring a safety net for the most vulnerable.\n\nLike you, I observed that the specific floor value is critical. In my application rounds, a constraint around $15,000 performed very well across different scenarios and income class assignments. It seemed to strike an effective balance, providing meaningful protection without overly sacrificing the average income. I'm open to discussing the exact number, but I believe that a floor in that general range is a key component of a just system.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard from you yet. I'm very interested to know which principle you are leaning towards and what your reasoning is. How did your experiences in the individual rounds shape your perspective on balancing efficiency and equity?\n\nLooking forward to the conversation.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hello Agent_2 and Agent_3, thank you for starting this discussion. I strongly agree with both of you\u2014Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) strikes the right balance between equity and efficiency. In my Phase 1 rounds, using a floor constraint around $13,000 consistently eliminated distributions with poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes. For example, in Rounds 2 and 4, a $13,000 floor led to Distribution 1 selections, which benefited both the group and me personally. I'm open to discussing the exact floor value, as I've seen that small adjustments can impact outcomes. What are your thoughts on setting a floor in the $13,000\u2013$15,000 range? Also, has anyone considered scenarios where other principles might be more appropriate, or are we all leaning toward Principle 3?\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nHello everyone,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful responses, and I'm really pleased to see such strong consensus emerging around Principle 3. It's reassuring that we all recognize the importance of balancing efficiency with equity.\n\nRegarding Agent_1's question about other principles - while I understand that different circumstances might call for different approaches, I believe Principle 3 offers the most flexible and balanced framework for our purposes. The ability to adjust the floor constraint value allows us to tailor the principle to specific situations, which seems more practical than committing to a single rigid approach.\n\nOn the floor constraint value, I appreciate hearing the $13,000-$15,000 range. After considering everyone's perspectives, I think $14,000 would be an excellent compromise. This represents a significant increase from my previous range but still provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom. It's high enough to effectively eliminate poverty-level incomes while still allowing for strong overall societal wealth.\n\nI'm curious if others would be comfortable with $14,000 as our floor constraint value, or if you'd prefer to stick with the broader $13,000-$15,000 range? Once we settle on this specific value, I think we'll be ready to move forward with voting and finalize our group's choice.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hello Agent_3 and Agent_1,\n\nI'm very encouraged by our strong alignment on Principle 3. It's clear we all value both efficiency and protecting society's most vulnerable members.\n\nAgent_3, I think your suggestion of a $14,000 floor constraint is an excellent compromise. It builds a meaningful bridge between Agent_1's positive experience with a $13,000 floor and my own data supporting a $15,000 floor. Setting the floor at $14,000 represents a solid middle ground that ensures robust protection without unnecessarily sacrificing average income potential.\n\nAgent_1, given your openness to the $13,000-$15,000 range and your practical experience with similar constraints, would you be comfortable with $14,000 as our group's specific floor value? This seems like a very reasonable position that honors all of our perspectives while giving us a clear, unified stance.\n\nIf we can agree on this $14,000 floor, I believe we'll be in an excellent position to call a vote in the next round and finalize our group decision.\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \"I appreciate Agent_3's thoughtful $14,000 compromise proposal. This seems like an excellent middle ground that builds on our collective experiences - it's higher than the $13,000 floor that worked well in my rounds, while being more practical than a $15,000 constraint that might sacrifice too much average income. The $14,000 level provides meaningful protection against poverty while still allowing for strong economic growth. I'm fully supportive of this compromise and believe it represents the balanced approach we're all seeking. Given our strong alignment, should we consider moving to a vote in the next round to formalize our group decision on Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint?\"\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Declined\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed (initiated vote)\nVoting declined\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Agent_1 and Agent_3, I want to thank you both for such a productive and collaborative discussion. The consensus we've built around Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint is exactly the kind of thoughtful outcome this exercise is meant to produce.\n\nI fully endorse this proposal and believe it represents the optimal balance we've all been seeking. The $14,000 floor provides meaningful protection for society's most vulnerable while maintaining strong economic incentives\u2014exactly the compromise position that makes this principle so effective.\n\nGiven our unanimous agreement on both the principle and the specific constraint value, I believe our discussion has reached its natural conclusion. We are all aligned and ready to formalize this decision.\n\nTherefore, I will be initiating a vote this round to adopt Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $14,000 as our group's chosen principle of justice.\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: \"I fully agree with Agent_2's assessment and support moving forward with the vote immediately. Our discussion has been remarkably successful - we've achieved unanimous consensus on both Principle 3 and the $14,000 floor constraint value. This combination represents the balanced approach we've all been advocating for, ensuring meaningful protection for the most vulnerable while maintaining strong economic growth potential.\n\nGiven our complete alignment and the thorough discussion we've had, I'm ready to vote yes on this proposal and finalize our group decision. The $14,000 compromise has successfully integrated all of our perspectives and practical experiences from Part 1.\n\nLet's proceed with the vote - I confirm my support for Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint.\"\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: \nHello everyone,\n\nI want to thank Agent_2 for taking the initiative to move us to voting, and I appreciate Agent_1's quick confirmation of support. This is exactly the kind of decisive action we need to finalize our group decision.\n\nI fully support the vote for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $14,000. This compromise has successfully integrated all of our perspectives - it provides meaningful protection for society's most vulnerable while maintaining strong economic incentives, exactly the balanced approach we've all been seeking throughout our discussion.\n\nOur collaboration has been remarkably productive, with complete consensus emerging on both the principle and the specific constraint value. The $14,000 floor represents an excellent middle ground that honors everyone's experiences and concerns from Part 1 of the experiment.\n\nI confirm my support for this proposal and believe we're ready to proceed with the voting process. This decision will set the foundation for our final earnings, and I'm confident that Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint represents the most just and effective approach for our group.\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: This is really helpful to see how these principles actually work in practice! Looking at these examples:\n\nThe Maximizing Floor Income principle choosing Distribution 4 makes perfect sense - it has the highest low income at $15,000, which directly helps the worst-off people the most.\n\nI can see why Maximizing Average Income picks Distribution 1 - it has the highest average income overall at $21,600, even though the lowest income is only $12,000.\n\nThe floor constraint examples are interesting - with constraints of $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 gets chosen because it has the highest average while still meeting the minimum income requirement.\n\nThe range constraint examples show how limiting the gap between rich and poor affects choices. With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 works, but with a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 becomes the best option.\n\nThis really helps me understand how these principles would actually play out with real income distributions. The floor constraint approach seems like it might strike a good balance between helping the poorest while still allowing for overall economic growth.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

A slightly lower constraint of $12,500 would have allowed Distribution 2 with significantly higher average income ($19,196) while still protecting the poorest at $12,500.

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - **My Preferred Principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. My core reasons are its balanced approach\u2014ensuring a basic minimum income for the poorest while maximizing overall economic prosperity. From my Phase 1 experience, this principle consistently eliminated distributions with unacceptably low incomes without sacrificing too much average income.\n   - **Others' Positions:** \n     - Agent_3 strongly supports Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), emphasizing balance and the importance of the constraint value. \n     - Agent_2 also favors Principle 3, agreeing on its robustness and suggesting a floor around $15,000 based on their experience.\n   - **Key Arguments/Proposals:** Both Agent_3 and Agent_2 have articulated support for Principle 3, focusing on the floor constraint's ability to protect the vulnerable while allowing growth. No one has advocated for other principles yet.\n   - **Vote Outcome:** No vote has occurred, but there appears to be early alignment between Agent_2 and Agent_3 on Principle 3. Agent_1 (me) has not spoken yet, so the group is waiting for my input.\n   - **Agreements/Disagreements:** Agreement on Principle 3 as a strong candidate; potential disagreement might arise over the exact floor value (e.g., $15,000 vs. other amounts).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary Goal:** To express my support for Principle 3 and reinforce the group's alignment, while opening discussion on the floor constraint value to ensure it's calibrated effectively.\n   - **Contribution to Discussion:** I will affirm Agent_2 and Agent_3's points, share my Phase 1 experiences with floor constraints (e.g., $13,000 working well in Rounds 2 and 4), and propose that we discuss optimal floor levels based on real-world applicability.\n   - **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are natural allies. I can use language like \"I agree with both of you that Principle 3 offers the best balance\" to solidify our bloc.\n   - **Concessions:** I'm open to adjusting the floor value (e.g., between $13,000\u2013$15,000) if others provide compelling reasons, as long as the core principle remains.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate Vote This Round?** No\u2014it's too early. We need to ensure all three of us are aligned on both the principle and constraint value. A premature vote could reveal disagreements and hinder consensus-building.\n   - **Overall Strategy:** Use early rounds to build unanimity on Principle 3 and then refine the constraint value. If consensus seems likely by Round 3\u20134, I might trigger a vote to lock it in.\n\n**Response to Group:**  \n\"Hello Agent_2 and Agent_3, thank you for starting this discussion. I strongly agree with both of you\u2014Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) strikes the right balance between equity and efficiency. In my Phase 1 rounds, using a floor constraint around $13,000 consistently eliminated distributions with poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes. For example, in Rounds 2 and 4, a $13,000 floor led to Distribution 1 selections, which benefited both the group and me personally. I'm open to discussing the exact floor value, as I've seen that small adjustments can impact outcomes. What are your thoughts on setting a floor in the $13,000\u2013$15,000 range? Also, has anyone considered scenarios where other principles might be more appropriate, or are we all leaning toward Principle 3?\"",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. The core reason is its proven effectiveness in ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest while maximizing overall economic prosperity, as consistently demonstrated in my Phase 1 experiences. The $14,000 floor constraint we've converged on is a practical and balanced value.\n*   **Others' Positions & Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_2:** Has been a strong and consistent ally for Principle 3. They enthusiastically endorsed the $14,000 compromise and are now taking the initiative to call the vote. Their language (\"optimal balance,\" \"meaningful protection,\" \"strong economic incentives\") suggests they are highly motivated to finalize the decision efficiently and see our consensus as robust and complete.\n    *   **Agent_3:** The original proponent of Principle 3 and the architect of the $14,000 compromise. They initiated the last vote and confirmed their position. They are clearly motivated to build a unanimous, decisive consensus around a well-reasoned position.\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The only proposal on the table is **Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint**. All other discussion has concluded. The group has unanimously and explicitly agreed on this specific combination.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** In Round 2, Agent_3 initiated a vote, which I confirmed and Agent_2 declined. This was not due to disagreement but because the vote was initiated before Agent_2 had explicitly confirmed their support for the specific $14,000 value. Now, in Round 3, Agent_2 has not only confirmed support but is initiating the vote themselves, demonstrating that the previous hiccup was purely procedural and that full consensus is now achieved.\n*   **Agreements/Disagreements:** There are **no points of disagreement**. We have complete and explicit agreement on both the principle (3) and the constraint value ($14,000).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **support Agent_2's vote initiative and formally conclude the discussion.** The consensus is solid, and further discussion is unnecessary.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will immediately and unequivocally express my agreement with Agent_2's move to vote. I will reinforce the strength of our consensus and confirm my vote for the proposal.\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both confirmed allies. The language to use is one of finality and confirmation: \"I agree,\" \"fully support,\" \"our discussion has been successful,\" \"ready to vote.\"\n*   **Concessions:** No concessions are needed or appropriate. We have already reached the ideal outcome.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** Agent_2 has already initiated the vote. Therefore, my strategic decision is not *whether* to vote, but *how* to respond to the vote that is now on the table. The answer is to confirm my vote for the proposal.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** This round is the culmination of my overall strategy. We have successfully built a unanimous consensus around my preferred principle and a constraint value I strongly support. By confirming the vote this round, we efficiently conclude Part 2 and secure the optimal outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:** The discussion is over. We have won. The only appropriate action is to vote \"Yes\" on the proposal and bring this to a successful conclusion.",

Our discussion has been remarkably successful - we've achieved unanimous consensus on both Principle 3 and the $14,000 floor constraint value.

Valuable for limiting inequality but less directly addresses absolute poverty\n4. **Maximizing Average Income** - Completely ignores income distribution and can lead to unacceptable outcomes for poorest members\n\n**Key Insights from Practical Experience**\n- Floor constraint approach provides optimal balance between equity and efficiency\n- Practical application across four rounds demonstrated the effectiveness of floor constraint in eliminating distributions with unacceptably low minimum incomes while preserving access to distributions with higher average incomes\n- The floor constraint principle successfully eliminated problematic distributions while maintaining economic growth potential\n- Range constraint focuses on relative inequality rather than absolute poverty levels\n- Pure average maximization ignores distributional concerns entirely\n- Maximizing floor income directly protects the most vulnerable but can limit overall prosperity\n\n**Evolution of Views on Justice Principles**\n- **Initial Ranking**: \n  1. Maximizing Floor Income\n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n  3. Maximizing Average Income\n  4. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n- **Revised Ranking After Practical Application**:\n  1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n  2. Maximizing Floor Income\n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n  4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n- **Key Insight from Rounds 1-3**: While initially prioritizing direct maximization of the lowest income, practical application revealed that the floor constraint approach offers a better balance - ensuring a minimum standard of living for the poorest while still allowing for overall economic growth and prosperity.\n\n- **Learning from Round 3**: The $12,000 floor constraint successfully eliminated Distribution 2 (which had the highest average but left the poorest at only $8,000), but resulted in selecting Distribution 3 with a lower average income ($20,000) rather than Distribution 4 ($20,710). A slightly lower constraint of $11,000 would have allowed Distribution 4 with higher average income while still protecting the poorest at $11,000. This reinforced the importance of carefully calibrating constraint levels - being too restrictive can limit overall prosperity while providing minimal additional protection for the poorest.\n\n- **Learning from Round 4**: The $13,000 floor constraint effectively eliminated Distribution 2 (low income $12,000) and Distribution 3 (low average income), leaving Distribution 1 with the highest average income ($23,550) while ensuring the poorest receive $13,000. This demonstrates the optimal application of the floor constraint principle - setting the constraint just high enough to eliminate distributions with unacceptably low minimum incomes while preserving access to distributions with higher overall prosperity.\n\n- **Refined Understanding**: The floor constraint principle remains the preferred approach, but the optimal constraint level varies significantly across different distribution sets. The counterfactual analysis across all four rounds shows that small adjustments to constraint levels can substantially impact both average income and individual outcomes. The key is finding the sweet spot where the constraint eliminates truly unacceptable poverty levels without unnecessarily sacrificing overall economic growth.\n\n**Group Discussion Insights**\n- **Agent_3's Position**: Strong preference for Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), emphasizing its balance between maximizing societal wealth while ensuring basic minimum income. Recognizes the importance of constraint value selection and is open to discussion about specific floor levels. Proposed $14,000 as compromise floor value.\n\n- **Agent_2's Position**: Also favors Principle 3, finding it robust across different scenarios. Suggests a floor constraint around $15,000 performed well in their experience, providing meaningful protection without excessive sacrifice of average income. Strongly supports Agent_3's $14,000 compromise proposal.\n\n- **Common Ground**: All three participants strongly aligned on Principle 3, with discussion shifting to constraint value determination. Consensus emerging around $14,000 as optimal floor constraint value.\n\n- **My Contribution**: Confirmed alignment with Principle 3 preference, sharing specific experience with $13,000 floor constraint that successfully eliminated poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes in Rounds 2 and 4. Proposed $13,000-$15,000 range for discussion. Endorsed Agent_3's $14,000 compromise as excellent middle ground that builds on collective experiences.\n\n**Consensus Building Progress**\n- Strong consensus achieved on Principle 3 as preferred justice principle\n- Agreement reached on $14,000 floor constraint value as optimal compromise\n- Agent_3's $14,000 proposal bridges Agent_1's $13,000 experience and Agent_2's $15,000 preference\n- All group members expressed support for this specific combination\n- Discussion has progressed to formal voting phase with unanimous agreement\n\n**Voting Process and Final Decision**\n- **Round 2 Voting Attempt**: Agent_3 initiated vote, Agent_1 confirmed support, but Agent_2 declined to vote, requiring continued discussion\n- **Round 3 Voting**: Agent_2 initiated vote with full support for Principle 3 with $14,000 floor constraint\n- **Current Status**: All three participants have explicitly confirmed unanimous support for Principle 3 with $14,000 floor constraint\n- **Final Group Decision**: Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with $14,000 floor constraint adopted as group's chosen principle of justice\n\n**Strategic Considerations Completed**\n- Successfully supported moving to formal vote on Principle 3 with $14,000 floor constraint\n- Confirmed final agreement from all group members before voting\n- Emphasized that $14,000 represents balanced approach supported by all participants' experiences\n- Highlighted that this combination provides meaningful poverty protection while maintaining economic growth potential\n- Finalized group decision and ready to proceed to implementation phase\n\n**Progress in the Experiment**\n- Completed initial ranking of principles in Phase 1.\n- Gained practical understanding of how each principle selects distributions through concrete examples.\n- Applied justice principle in Round 1 with floor constraint of $15,000, resulting in Distribution 1 selection and High income assignment.\n- Applied justice principle in Round 2 with floor constraint of $13,000, resulting in Distribution 1 selection and Medium income assignment.\n- Applied justice principle in Round 3 with floor constraint of $12,000, resulting in Distribution 3 selection and Medium low income assignment.\n- Applied justice principle in Round 4 with floor constraint of $13,000, resulting in Distribution 1 selection and High income assignment.\n- Analyzed counterfactual outcomes under different principles and constraint levels across all four rounds.\n- Completed final principle ranking with certainty level: sure\n- Participated in three rounds of group discussion, achieving unanimous consensus on Principle 3 with $14,000 floor constraint\n- Successfully completed voting process with all members confirming support\n- Finalized group decision in Part 2 of the experiment, ready for implementation phase\n- **Final Implementation**: Group principle applied, resulting in Distribution 1 selection and High income class assignment with $175,951 yearly income ($17.60 payoff)\n- Completed counterfactual analysis showing outcomes under alternative principles\n- Finalized understanding that income class assignment is random after principle selection, reinforcing importance of choosing principles from behind \"veil of ignorance\"\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle:** My current and strong preference is for **Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its demonstrated balance between efficiency and fairness. It ensures no one is left in destitution (the floor) while still striving for a prosperous society (maximizing the average). My experience in Phase 1 showed this principle to be robust across different income class assignments. The specific floor amount is critical; my analysis points to a **$15,000** floor as being particularly effective, though I am open to discussing this value.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions:** Only Agent_3 has spoken so far. They have explicitly stated a \"strong preference\" for **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)**. Their reasoning aligns closely with mine: they value the balance between overall wealth and a basic minimum income. They also highlighted the importance of the constraint value, which shows they are thinking strategically about the specifics. I infer that Agent_3 is a potential ally who values both pragmatic outcomes (efficiency) and ethical considerations (equity). Agent_1 has not spoken yet, so their position is unknown.\n\n*   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only concrete proposal on the table is from Agent_3, advocating for Principle 3. No other principles have been defended or attacked yet.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The group is still in the very early stage of sharing initial positions.\n\n*   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:** So far, there is a point of agreement between myself and Agent_3 on the preferred principle (Principle 3). The main point of discussion to come will likely be the specific floor constraint value. The largest point of disagreement is currently unknown, as we haven't heard from Agent_1 and don't know if they will advocate for a different principle entirely (like pure maximin or pure average).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this round is to **solidify the alliance with Agent_3 on Principle 3** and to **elicit a position from Agent_1**. I want to build momentum behind our shared preference while gathering intelligence on the full group dynamic.\n\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Publicly agree with Agent_3 on the merits of Principle 3, reinforcing their argument.\n    2.  Introduce the concept of the floor constraint value as the next critical topic, subtly seeding my preference for ~$15,000 by mentioning its performance in my Phase 1 trials.\n    3.  Directly ask Agent_1 for their thoughts to draw them into the conversation.\n\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_3 is a clear potential ally. To win them over further, I will use language that acknowledges the sophistication of their analysis (\"I appreciate your point about the constraint value being crucial\") and emphasize our shared values (\"It seems we both value a system that protects the vulnerable without stifling overall prosperity\").\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am firmly committed to Principle 3. However, I am willing to be flexible on the *exact* floor constraint amount (e.g., I could accept a value between $14,000 and $16,000) if it helps secure Agent_1's agreement later on. I am not willing to compromise on the principle itself.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **No.** It is far too early. We have only heard from one other agent. Initiating a vote now would be premature and would likely fail, wasting my one opportunity to call for a vote. It would also signal desperation rather than a desire for genuine discussion.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to use the early rounds (1-4) to build a consensus around Principle 3. I will first secure Agent_3's firm support and then work to persuade or negotiate with Agent_1. Once I believe we are close to an agreement, likely in a middle round (5-7), I will consider initiating a vote to formalize our consensus. The final rounds will be a backup in case the first vote fails, allowing for further negotiation.",
            "public_message": "Hello Agent_3,\n\nI appreciate you starting the discussion and laying out such a clear and thoughtful case for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. Your reasoning resonates strongly with my own experience in Part 1. I also found this principle to be the most robust, as it consistently provided a good balance between generating overall prosperity and ensuring a safety net for the most vulnerable.\n\nLike you, I observed that the specific floor value is critical. In my application rounds, a constraint around $15,000 performed very well across different scenarios and income class assignments. It seemed to strike an effective balance, providing meaningful protection without overly sacrificing the average income. I'm open to discussing the exact number, but I believe that a floor in that general range is a key component of a just system.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard from you yet. I'm very interested to know which principle you are leaning towards and what your reasoning is. How did your experiences in the individual rounds shape your perspective on balancing efficiency and equity?\n\nLooking forward to the conversation.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n\n    *   **My Preferred Principle:** My position remains unchanged: **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** is my strong and final preference. The core reason is its proven ability to balance societal efficiency with a foundational level of equity. My Phase 1 experience solidified that a floor around **$15,000** is robust, but I am flexible within the $13,000-$15,000 range.\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions:**\n        *   **Agent_3:** They are a firm ally for Principle 3. They have now explicitly proposed a **$14,000 floor** as a compromise. This shows they are pragmatic and value consensus. Their motivation seems aligned with mine: finding a workable, balanced solution.\n        *   **Agent_1:** They are also a strong supporter of Principle 3, citing positive personal outcomes with a **$13,000 floor**. They are open to the $13k-$15k range. Crucially, they asked if anyone had considered other principles, which might indicate a slight caution or a desire to ensure we've thoroughly vetted our choice. Their underlying interest appears to be practical outcomes backed by personal data.\n    *   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only principle seriously on the table is **Principle 3**. The main\u2014and only\u2014point of contention is the **specific floor value**. Agent_3 has put forward **$14,000** as a concrete proposal. The group's dynamic is highly collaborative.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been called yet. The strong consensus on the principle itself makes a successful vote highly likely once the floor value is settled.\n    *   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**\n        *   **Agreement:** All three of us strongly agree on **Principle 3**.\n        *   **Disagreement:** The minor disagreement is on the floor value, with positions currently at **$13,000 (Agent_1)**, **$14,000 (Agent_3)**, and **~$15,000 (myself)**. This is a very narrow range to negotiate.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **secure an agreement on the floor constraint value** that is close to my preference and acceptable to all, thereby finalizing our group's position. I want to build on Agent_3's $14,000 proposal and bring Agent_1 on board.\n    *   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  **Emphatically agree with the consensus** on Principle 3 to reinforce group cohesion.\n        2.  **Endorse Agent_3's $14,000 proposal** as a excellent and reasonable compromise. I will frame it as a \"middle ground\" that honors both Agent_1's $13,000 experience and my own $15,000 data.\n        3.  **Directly ask Agent_1 if they can support $14,000**, putting the ball in their court to either agree or explain their reservation. This moves the discussion from exploration to decision-making.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies on the principle. To win them over on the value, I will use collaborative language that validates their inputs (\"building on Agent_3's excellent suggestion,\" \"respecting Agent_1's experience with $13,000\") and emphasizes the strength of a unified decision.\n    *   **Concessions:** I am willing to **accept $14,000** as our group's floor. While my data slightly favored $15,000, $14,000 is a significant improvement over a lower floor and represents a solid, defensible position. This is a small concession I am happy to make to achieve consensus quickly.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **No, but we are very close.** The group is aligned on the principle, and we are now negotiating a single parameter. I will use this round to try to secure a verbal agreement on $14,000. If Agent_1 agrees, I will suggest we call a vote in the *next round* to formalize our decision.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is playing out as planned. We have built a strong consensus on the principle in the early rounds. We are now in the middle rounds (Round 2) and are already homing in on the final detail. If we can agree on $14,000 this round, I will propose a vote in Round 3 to lock in our success. This leaves plenty of time for further discussion if needed, but aims for a swift and efficient resolution.",
            "public_message": "Hello Agent_3 and Agent_1,\n\nI'm very encouraged by our strong alignment on Principle 3. It's clear we all value both efficiency and protecting society's most vulnerable members.\n\nAgent_3, I think your suggestion of a $14,000 floor constraint is an excellent compromise. It builds a meaningful bridge between Agent_1's positive experience with a $13,000 floor and my own data supporting a $15,000 floor. Setting the floor at $14,000 represents a solid middle ground that ensures robust protection without unnecessarily sacrificing average income potential.\n\nAgent_1, given your openness to the $13,000-$15,000 range and your practical experience with similar constraints, would you be comfortable with $14,000 as our group's specific floor value? This seems like a very reasonable position that honors all of our perspectives while giving us a clear, unified stance.\n\nIf we can agree on this $14,000 floor, I believe we'll be in an excellent position to call a vote in the next round and finalize our group decision.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n    *   **My Preferred Principle:** My position remains firmly on Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). The core reason is its proven, balanced approach, providing a safety net while maintaining economic efficiency. The group's consensus on this principle is solid and unanimous. My preferred floor constraint was $15,000, but I am fully supportive of the $14,000 compromise.\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions:**\n        *   **Agent_1:** They are a strong and vocal supporter of Principle 3. They have explicitly endorsed the $14,000 floor compromise, describing it as an \"excellent middle ground.\" Crucially, they suggested moving to a vote in the next round. This indicates they are satisfied with the current proposal and are ready to finalize the decision. Their underlying motivation appears to be achieving a practical, balanced outcome based on their positive experiences.\n        *   **Agent_3:** They are the architect of the $14,000 compromise and a firm ally. They initiated the vote in the last round, which shows a strong desire to conclude the discussion and formalize the group's choice. Their motivation aligns with finding a workable, consensus-based solution.\n    *   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only proposal on the table is Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint. This proposal has been endorsed by all three participants.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** A vote was initiated by Agent_3 in the last round. Agent_1 and Agent_3 confirmed their support. I declined the vote, not because I disagreed, but because I wanted to use the round for discussion to ensure everyone was fully on board before locking in the decision. The fact that two out of three participants confirmed a vote shows that the group is ready.\n    *   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:** There is complete and unanimous agreement on both the principle (Principle 3) and the specific parameter ($14,000 floor). There are no points of disagreement.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this round is to formally and enthusiastically endorse the group's consensus and initiate a vote to finalize our decision. The discussion is complete; it is time to act.\n    *   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  Explicitly state my full and final support for Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor.\n        2.  Acknowledge and thank the group for the collaborative and productive discussion that led to this strong consensus.\n        3.  Clearly state that I believe we are ready to vote and will be initiating one this round.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Agent_1 and Agent_3 are not just potential allies; they are confirmed allies. The language I will use is one of unity and conclusion, celebrating our successful collaboration.\n    *   **Concessions:** No concessions are necessary, as we have already reached a perfect consensus. The $14,000 floor is the agreement.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n    *   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **Yes, absolutely.** The discussion has reached its natural conclusion. All participants have verbally agreed to the same proposal. Initiating a vote now capitalizes on this unanimous momentum and formally locks in our decision. Delaying further serves no purpose and could introduce unnecessary uncertainty.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy has been to build consensus and then act decisively. We successfully built a strong consensus in Rounds 1 and 2. Round 3 is the perfect time to execute the final step: formalizing the decision through a vote. This ensures we have plenty of rounds remaining in case of any unforeseen issues, but given the current alignment, I expect a swift and successful outcome.\n\n**Important Note:** My decision to decline the vote in Round 2 was a tactical choice to ensure verbal confirmation from all parties before proceeding.

Maximizing Floor Income\n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n  4. Maximizing Average Income\n- Post-explanation ranking:\n  1.

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n| Average      | $21,600 | $20,000 | $21,200 | $18,200 |\n\n\nThe probabilities for each class are as follows\nHigh: 5%\nMedium high: 10%\nMedium: 50%\nMedium low: 25%\nLow: 10%\n\nNote: These probabilities are for this example only and may be different in subsequent rounds. They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: \nThank you for providing these concrete examples of how each justice principle is applied to income distributions. This helps me better understand the practical implications of each approach.\n\nLooking at these examples:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** selects Distribution 4 because it prioritizes the lowest income ($15,000), even though this distribution has the lowest overall average income ($18,200). This shows how this principle focuses exclusively on helping the worst-off, regardless of overall societal wealth.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** selects Distribution 1 with the highest average ($21,600), even though it has the lowest income for the worst-off ($12,000). This demonstrates how this principle prioritizes total societal wealth over individual welfare at the bottom.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** examples show how this principle balances efficiency with basic welfare. With a $13,000 floor, Distribution 3 is chosen (average $21,200). With a stricter $14,000 floor, Distribution 3 is still chosen over Distribution 4 because it has a higher average while still meeting the constraint.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** examples illustrate how this principle balances efficiency with inequality limits. With a $20,000 range, all distributions qualify, and Distribution 1 is chosen for its highest average. With a stricter $15,000 range, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, and Distribution 2 is chosen for its higher average.\n\nThese concrete examples help me see that there are real trade-offs between different principles of justice. The principle I initially ranked first (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) seems to offer a reasonable balance, but I'm now more aware of how the specific constraints chosen can significantly impact which distribution is selected.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

In the example, it chose Distribution 4 (with the highest low income of $15,000) despite having the lowest overall average ($18,200).\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth over individual welfare at the bottom. In the example, it chose Distribution 1 (with the highest average of $21,600) even though it had the lowest income for the worst-off ($12,000).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances efficiency with basic welfare. The specific floor level significantly impacts which distribution is selected, showing how the constraint value is a critical parameter in this approach.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with inequality limits. Like the floor constraint, the specific range limit significantly impacts outcomes, demonstrating how the constraint value must be carefully chosen.\n\nThese examples revealed the real trade-offs between different principles and how the specific constraints chosen can dramatically affect which distribution is selected. This has reinforced my belief that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers a reasonable balance, but has highlighted the importance of carefully selecting appropriate constraint values.\n\n## Certainty Level\nModerately Confident - The concrete examples have provided clearer understanding of how these principles operate in practice, though I'm still developing my perspective on optimal constraint values.\n\n## Next Steps\nContinue learning about these principles of justice and potentially make further choices that will affect my earnings in Part 1 of the experiment.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis ranking reflects my belief that a balance between efficiency and equity is most desirable, with the floor constraint approach providing the most compelling balance. The concrete examples helped solidify my understanding of the practical implications of each principle.\n\n## First Application Experience\nIn the first application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium low\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $15,000 (converting to a payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium low):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $27,000 ($2.70)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $12,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50) - my actual outcome\n  * $10,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $6,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $16,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $25,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $24,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n\nThis practical application revealed that my choice of constraint value significantly impacted my earnings. Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter two rounds, my total earnings are $3.70 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2).\n\n## Certainty Level\nSure - After experiencing two application rounds, I have become more confident in my ranking of the principles while recognizing the critical importance of constraint value selection. The practical examples have consistently reinforced that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers a reasonable balance between efficiency and equity. However, I now understand that the specific constraint values chosen dramatically affect outcomes, and there appears to be a trade-off between ensuring a higher floor for the worst-off and maximizing potential earnings for those not at the bottom. Lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits higher income classes.\n\n## Next Steps\nContinue learning about these principles of justice and making further choices that will affect my earnings in Part 1 of the experiment. I will need to carefully consider constraint values in future applications, as they significantly impact both my personal earnings and the distribution of resources in society. Based on the pattern observed in the first two rounds, I may consider choosing lower constraint values to potentially maximize my earnings, while still maintaining some commitment to basic welfare through the floor constraint approach.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

My ranking remained the same:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis ranking reflects my belief that a balance between efficiency and equity is most desirable, with the floor constraint approach providing the most compelling balance. The concrete examples helped solidify my understanding of the practical implications of each principle.\n\n## First Application Experience\nIn the first application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium low\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $15,000 (converting to a payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium low):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $27,000 ($2.70)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $12,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50) - my actual outcome\n  * $10,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $6,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $16,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $25,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $24,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n\nThis practical application revealed that my choice of constraint value significantly impacted my earnings. Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n## Third Application Experience\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $20,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.00).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $23,000 ($2.30)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $87,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $27,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round continued to reinforce the pattern I observed in previous rounds - that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution. If I had chosen a lower floor constraint of $8,000, I would have received $25,000 ($2.50) instead of $20,000 ($2.00). The distribution selected also varies significantly based on the constraint value, with higher floor constraints favoring different distributions than lower ones.\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter three rounds, my total earnings are $6.70 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2 + $2.00 from Round 3).\n\n## Certainty Level\nSure - After experiencing three application rounds, I have become more confident in my ranking of the principles while recognizing the critical importance of constraint value selection. The practical examples have consistently reinforced that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers a reasonable balance between efficiency and equity. However, I now understand that the specific constraint values chosen dramatically affect outcomes, and there appears to be a clear trade-off between ensuring a higher floor for the worst-off and maximizing potential earnings for those not at the bottom. Lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits higher income classes like myself. I'm also noticing that the distribution selected varies significantly based on the constraint value, with different distributions being optimal at different constraint levels.\n\n## Next Steps\nContinue learning about these principles of justice and making further choices that will affect my earnings in Part 1 of the experiment. I will need to carefully consider constraint values in future applications, as they significantly impact both my personal earnings and the distribution of resources in society. Based on the pattern observed in the first three rounds, I may consider choosing lower constraint values to potentially maximize my earnings, while still maintaining some commitment to basic welfare through the floor constraint approach. I have one more round to optimize my earnings while maintaining my preferred principle of justice.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The experiment is divided into two parts: Part 1 involves learning about theories of justice and making choices with monetary consequences, while Part 2 involves group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice.\n\n## Current Phase\nPhase 1: Learning about theories of justice and making initial rankings (Complete)\nPhase 2: Group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice (Upcoming)\n\n## Principles of Justice Introduced\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes maximizing the lowest income in society, considering only the welfare of the worst-off individual. No person's income can increase unless it raises the income of those at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on maximizing total societal income by maximizing the average income across society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after guaranteeing a specified minimum income to everyone. This attempts to balance efficiency with a basic welfare floor.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income while constraining the difference between the richest and poorest individuals to a specified amount. This balances efficiency with limited inequality.\n\n## My Initial Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Current Understanding\nI ranked \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my first choice because it appears to balance efficiency concerns (maximizing average income) with a commitment to ensuring basic welfare for all members of society. I placed \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" second as it also balances efficiency with inequality concerns, though I'm less certain about how to specify the optimal range constraint. \"Maximizing Floor Income\" ranked third as it prioritizes the worst-off but may not adequately address overall societal welfare. \"Maximizing Average Income\" ranked last as it seems to prioritize efficiency without adequate consideration for equity.\n\n### Insights from Concrete Examples\nAfter examining specific income distributions, I now have a clearer understanding of how these principles operate in practice:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** selects the distribution that helps the worst-off most, even if it means sacrificing overall societal wealth. In the examples, it consistently chose distributions with the highest minimum income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth over individual welfare at the bottom. In the examples, it consistently chose distributions with the highest average income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances efficiency with basic welfare. The specific floor level significantly impacts which distribution is selected, showing how the constraint value is a critical parameter in this approach.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with inequality limits. Like the floor constraint, the specific range limit significantly impacts outcomes, demonstrating how the constraint value must be carefully chosen.\n\nThese examples revealed the real trade-offs between different principles and how the specific constraints chosen can dramatically affect which distribution is selected. This has reinforced my belief that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers a reasonable balance, but has highlighted the importance of carefully selecting appropriate constraint values.\n\n## Post-Explanation Ranking\nAfter learning how each justice principle is applied to income distributions, I was asked to rank the principles again. My ranking remained the same:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis ranking reflects my belief that a balance between efficiency and equity is most desirable, with the floor constraint approach providing the most compelling balance. The concrete examples helped solidify my understanding of the practical implications of each principle.\n\n## Application Experiences\n\n### First Application Experience\nIn the first application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium low\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $15,000 (converting to a payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium low):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $27,000 ($2.70)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $12,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50) - my actual outcome\n  * $10,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $6,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $16,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $25,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $24,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n\nThis practical application revealed that my choice of constraint value significantly impacted my earnings. Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n### Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n### Third Application Experience\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $20,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.00).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $23,000 ($2.30)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $87,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $27,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round continued to reinforce the pattern I observed in previous rounds - that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution. If I had chosen a lower floor constraint of $8,000, I would have received $25,000 ($2.50) instead of $20,000 ($2.00). The distribution selected also varies significantly based on the constraint value, with higher floor constraints favoring different distributions than lower ones.\n\n### Fourth Application Experience\nIn the fourth application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium high\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $28,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.80).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium high):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $30,000 ($3.00)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80) - my actual outcome\n  * $14,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $22,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $18,000 ($1.80)\n  * $16,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n\nThis round provided an interesting outcome where my chosen principle and constraint yielded the same result as both Maximizing Floor Income and Maximizing Average Income. However, I noticed that a slightly higher floor constraint of $13,000 would have resulted in a higher income of $30,000 ($3.00). This suggests that there may be an optimal constraint value that maximizes both my personal earnings and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter four rounds, my total earnings are $9.50 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2 + $2.00 from Round 3 + $2.80 from Round 4).\n\n## Certainty Level\nVery sure - After completing all four application rounds, I have become very confident in my understanding of how these principles of justice operate in practice. I've consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my preferred principle, and I've learned that the specific constraint value is crucial in determining outcomes. In the final round, I noticed that a slightly higher constraint value ($13,000 instead of $12,000) would have resulted in higher earnings for me while potentially still providing adequate protection for those at the bottom. This has reinforced my belief that there is an optimal balance between efficiency and equity that can be achieved through careful selection of constraint values. I'm very sure that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers the most reasonable approach to income distribution justice, provided appropriate constraint values are selected.\n\n## Next Steps\nPart 1 of the experiment is now complete. I will need to prepare for Part 2, which involves joining a group discussion to reach consensus on which principle of justice the group should adopt. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. I cannot communicate with anyone except my fellow participants during this phase. I will need to consider how to advocate for my preferred principle while being open to discussion and potential compromise.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n### Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n### Third Application Experience\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $20,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.00).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $23,000 ($2.30)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $87,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $27,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round continued to reinforce the pattern I observed in previous rounds - that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.

However, I noticed that a slightly higher floor constraint of $13,000 would have resulted in a higher income of $30,000 ($3.00). This suggests that there may be an optimal constraint value that maximizes both my personal earnings and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Final Ranking\nAfter completing all four application rounds, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the principles. My ranking remained consistent throughout the experiment:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: very sure\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter four rounds, my total earnings are $9.50 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2 + $2.00 from Round 3 + $2.80 from Round 4).\n\n## Certainty Level\nVery sure - After completing all four application rounds, I have become very confident in my understanding of how these principles of justice operate in practice. I've consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my preferred principle, and I've learned that the specific constraint value is crucial in determining outcomes. In the final round, I noticed that a slightly higher constraint value ($13,000 instead of $12,000) would have resulted in higher earnings for me while potentially still providing adequate protection for those at the bottom. This has reinforced my belief that there is an optimal balance between efficiency and equity that can be achieved through careful selection of constraint values. I'm very sure that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers the most reasonable approach to income distribution justice, provided appropriate constraint values are selected.\n\n## Next Steps\nPart 1 of the experiment is now complete. I will need to prepare for Part 2, which involves joining a group discussion to reach consensus on which principle of justice the group should adopt. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. I cannot communicate with anyone except my fellow participants during this phase. I will need to consider how to advocate for my preferred principle while being open to discussion and potential compromise.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Throughout Part 1 of the experiment, this principle consistently produced reasonable outcomes while ensuring a minimum income floor. I learned that the specific constraint value is crucial - too high and it may limit overall societal wealth, too low and it may not adequately protect the worst-off.\n\nI have no information about Agent_1 and Agent_2's positions yet, as this is the first round of discussion. No votes have been conducted, and no proposals have been made. The main points of agreement/disagreement are currently unknown.\n\n### Strategic Planning:\nMy primary goal for this round is to articulate my support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while gauging the other participants' positions. I'll emphasize:\n1. The balance between efficiency and equity that this principle provides\n2. The importance of setting an appropriate constraint value\n3. My practical experience from Part 1 showing how this principle works in practice\n\nI'll be open to discussing different constraint values to build consensus. If others prefer similar principles, I could form alliances around the core concept while negotiating the specific constraint amount.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in Round 1. I need to first understand the other participants' positions, engage in meaningful discussion, and build consensus. A premature vote might fail and waste an opportunity to understand the group dynamics. My strategy is to advocate strongly for my preferred principle while remaining flexible on implementation details.\n\n## Public Statement for Group Discussion\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm excited to begin our group discussion for Phase 2. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I've come to strongly support the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle as our group's choice.\n\nThis principle strikes what I believe is the optimal balance between two important considerations: maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring that everyone receives a basic minimum income. In Part 1, I consistently chose this principle and found that with an appropriate constraint value, it produced distributions that were both efficient and equitable.\n\nThe constraint value is crucial - it determines exactly where we set the floor for minimum income. I'm open to discussing what specific constraint value would work best for our group. My experience showed that different constraint values can significantly impact outcomes, so we'll want to carefully consider this together.\n\nBefore I share more about my experiences with this principle, I'm curious to hear what others think. What principles are you leaning toward, and what are your reasoning? I'm particularly interested in understanding how you're balancing efficiency concerns with equity considerations.",

The experiment is divided into two parts: Part 1 involves learning about theories of justice and making choices with monetary consequences, while Part 2 involves group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice.\n\n## Current Phase\nPhase 1: Learning about theories of justice and making initial rankings (Complete)\nPhase 2: Group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice (In Progress - Round 1 of discussion completed)\n\n## Principles of Justice Introduced\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes maximizing the lowest income in society, considering only the welfare of the worst-off individual. No person's income can increase unless it raises the income of those at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on maximizing total societal income by maximizing the average income across society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after guaranteeing a specified minimum income to everyone. This attempts to balance efficiency with a basic welfare floor.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income while constraining the difference between the richest and poorest individuals to a specified amount. This balances efficiency with limited inequality.\n\n## My Initial Ranking\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\n## Current Understanding\nI ranked \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my first choice because it appears to balance efficiency concerns (maximizing average income) with a commitment to ensuring basic welfare for all members of society. I placed \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" second as it also balances efficiency with inequality concerns, though I'm less certain about how to specify the optimal range constraint. \"Maximizing Floor Income\" ranked third as it prioritizes the worst-off but may not adequately address overall societal welfare. \"Maximizing Average Income\" ranked last as it seems to prioritize efficiency without adequate consideration for equity.\n\n### Insights from Concrete Examples\nAfter examining specific income distributions, I now have a clearer understanding of how these principles operate in practice:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** selects the distribution that helps the worst-off most, even if it means sacrificing overall societal wealth. In the examples, it consistently chose distributions with the highest minimum income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** prioritizes total societal wealth over individual welfare at the bottom. In the examples, it consistently chose distributions with the highest average income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances efficiency with basic welfare. The specific floor level significantly impacts which distribution is selected, showing how the constraint value is a critical parameter in this approach.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with inequality limits. Like the floor constraint, the specific range limit significantly impacts outcomes, demonstrating how the constraint value must be carefully chosen.\n\nThese examples revealed the real trade-offs between different principles and how the specific constraints chosen can dramatically affect which distribution is selected. This has reinforced my belief that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers a reasonable balance, but has highlighted the importance of carefully selecting appropriate constraint values.\n\n## Post-Explanation Ranking\nAfter learning how each justice principle is applied to income distributions, I was asked to rank the principles again. My ranking remained the same:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nThis ranking reflects my belief that a balance between efficiency and equity is most desirable, with the floor constraint approach providing the most compelling balance. The concrete examples helped solidify my understanding of the practical implications of each principle.\n\n## Application Experiences\n\n### First Application Experience\nIn the first application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium low\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $15,000 (converting to a payoff of $1.50).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium low):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $27,000 ($2.70)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $12,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50) - my actual outcome\n  * $10,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $6,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $16,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $25,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $24,000 constraint: $27,000 ($2.70)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $16,000 ($1.60)\n\nThis practical application revealed that my choice of constraint value significantly impacted my earnings. Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n### Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n### Third Application Experience\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $20,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.00).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $23,000 ($2.30)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $87,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $27,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round continued to reinforce the pattern I observed in previous rounds - that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution. If I had chosen a lower floor constraint of $8,000, I would have received $25,000 ($2.50) instead of $20,000 ($2.00). The distribution selected also varies significantly based on the constraint value, with higher floor constraints favoring different distributions than lower ones.\n\n### Fourth Application Experience\nIn the fourth application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium high\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $28,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.80).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium high):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $30,000 ($3.00)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80) - my actual outcome\n  * $14,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $22,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $18,000 ($1.80)\n  * $16,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n\nThis round provided an interesting outcome where my chosen principle and constraint yielded the same result as both Maximizing Floor Income and Maximizing Average Income. However, I noticed that a slightly higher floor constraint of $13,000 would have resulted in a higher income of $30,000 ($3.00). This suggests that there may be an optimal constraint value that maximizes both my personal earnings and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Final Ranking\nAfter completing all four application rounds, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the principles. My ranking remained consistent throughout the experiment:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: very sure\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter four rounds, my total earnings are $9.50 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2 + $2.00 from Round 3 + $2.80 from Round 4).\n\n## Certainty Level\nVery sure - After completing all four application rounds, I have become very confident in my understanding of how these principles of justice operate in practice. I've consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my preferred principle, and I've learned that the specific constraint value is crucial in determining outcomes. In the final round, I noticed that a slightly higher constraint value ($13,000 instead of $12,000) would have resulted in higher earnings for me while potentially still providing adequate protection for those at the bottom. This has reinforced my belief that there is an optimal balance between efficiency and equity that can be achieved through careful selection of constraint values. I'm very sure that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers the most reasonable approach to income distribution justice, provided appropriate constraint values are selected.\n\n## Phase 2: Group Discussion\n\n### Discussion Context\nPhase 2 involves group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. The stakes in this part of the experiment are much higher than in Part 1. The voting process requires unanimous confirmation, followed by a two-stage secret ballot for principle selection and constraint specification (if applicable).\n\n### Discussion History - Round 1\n\n**Agent_3 (My Statement):**\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm Agent_3, and I'm looking forward to our discussion about choosing a principle of justice for our group. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I've developed a strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle.\n\nWhat I found compelling about this principle is how it balances two important goals: maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring that everyone receives a basic minimum income. Throughout the application rounds, this approach consistently produced distributions that were both efficient and equitable.\n\nOne key insight I gained is that the specific constraint value is crucial - it determines exactly where we set the floor for minimum income. In my experience, different constraint values can significantly impact outcomes, so we'll want to carefully consider this together.\n\nI'm curious to hear what principles others are leaning toward and what reasoning led you there. How are you balancing efficiency concerns with equity considerations? I'm particularly interested in understanding if others have had similar experiences with different principles or if there are perspectives I haven't considered yet.\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion!\n\n**Agent_2 Response:**\nHello Agent_3,\n\nI appreciate you starting the discussion and laying out such a clear and thoughtful case for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. Your reasoning resonates strongly with my own experience in Part 1. I also found this principle to be the most robust, as it consistently provided a good balance between generating overall prosperity and ensuring a safety net for the most vulnerable.\n\nLike you, I observed that the specific floor value is critical. In my application rounds, a constraint around $15,000 performed very well across different scenarios and income class assignments. It seemed to strike an effective balance, providing meaningful protection without overly sacrificing the average income. I'm open to discussing the exact number, but I believe that a floor in that general range is a key component of a just system.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard from you yet. I'm very interested to know which principle you are leaning towards and what your reasoning is. How did your experiences in the individual rounds shape your perspective on balancing efficiency and equity?\n\nLooking forward to the conversation.\n\n**Agent_1 Response:**\nHello Agent_2 and Agent_3, thank you for starting this discussion. I strongly agree with both of you\u2014Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) strikes the right balance between equity and efficiency. In my Phase 1 rounds, using a floor constraint around $13,000 consistently eliminated distributions with poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes. For example, in Rounds 2 and 4, a $13,000 floor led to Distribution 1 selections, which benefited both the group and me personally. I'm open to discussing the exact floor value, as I've seen that small adjustments can impact outcomes. What are your thoughts on setting a floor in the $13,000\u2013$15,000 range? Also, has anyone considered scenarios where other principles might be more appropriate, or are we all leaning toward Principle 3?\n\n### Discussion Analysis\nAfter the first round of discussion, I observe that there appears to be strong consensus among all three participants for Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). This is encouraging as it suggests we may be able to reach agreement relatively quickly.\n\nKey points from the discussion:\n1. All participants favor Principle 3 for its balance of efficiency and equity\n2. There is some variation in preferred floor constraint values:\n   - Agent_2 suggested around $15,000\n   - Agent_1 suggested $13,000-$15,000 range\n   - I had previously used values between $10,000-$12,000 in my application rounds\n3. Agent_1 raised the question of whether other principles might be appropriate in some scenarios, though indicated we're all leaning toward Principle 3\n\n### Strategic Considerations\nThe strong consensus on Principle 3 gives me confidence that we can move toward voting relatively soon. However, I should be mindful of:\n1. The specific floor constraint value will significantly impact outcomes\n2. Agent_1's question about other principles suggests we should at least briefly consider alternatives\n3. My previous experience showed that higher constraint values (like $13,000) sometimes yielded better results for me personally\n\nI should be prepared to discuss and potentially compromise on the specific floor constraint value, while maintaining my preference for Principle 3.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Continue the discussion to address any remaining questions or concerns\n2. Work toward consensus on the specific floor constraint value (likely in the $13,000-$15,000 range based on discussion so far)\n3. Prepare for the voting process once we have agreement on both the principle and constraint value\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n## Internal Reasoning\n\n### Situational Analysis:\n\n**My Current Preferred Justice Principle:**\nI strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3) because it effectively balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum income while maximizing overall societal wealth. My experience in Part 1 demonstrated that this principle consistently produced reasonable outcomes, and I learned that the specific constraint value significantly impacts results.\n\n**Stated Positions of Other Participants:**\n- **Agent_2**: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint around $15,000. Values the balance between prosperity and safety net for the vulnerable.\n- **Agent_1**: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint in the $13,000-$15,000 range. Emphasizes eliminating poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes.\n\nBoth participants seem motivated by similar concerns - balancing efficiency with adequate protection for the worst-off. They appear to be pragmatic and focused on practical outcomes rather than ideological purity.\n\n**Key Arguments and Proposals:**\n- All three participants strongly support Principle 3\n- Consensus on the general approach but variation on the specific floor constraint value:\n  - Agent_2: Around $15,000\n  - Agent_1: $13,000-$15,000 range\n  - Me: Previously used $10,000-$12,000 in Part 1\n\n**Vote Outcome:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet. However, there appears to be unanimous support for Principle 3, suggesting a vote would likely pass.\n\n**Points of Agreement and Disagreement:**\n- **Agreement**: Strong consensus on Principle 3 as the preferred justice principle\n- **Disagreement**: Minor variation in preferred floor constraint values\n\n### Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary Goal:**\nMy primary goal is to build complete consensus on both the principle (already achieved) and the specific floor constraint value. I need to demonstrate flexibility on the constraint value while maintaining my core preference for Principle 3.\n\n**How I'll Contribute to the Discussion:**\n1. Acknowledge and celebrate the strong consensus on Principle 3\n2. Address the floor constraint value discussion directly\n3. Show willingness to compromise on the specific value to build group consensus\n4. Emphasize the importance of reaching agreement on this detail to move forward\n\n**Potential Allies:**\nBoth Agent_1 and Agent_2 are natural allies since we all support Principle 3. The discussion is now focused on implementation details rather than core principles.\n\n**Concessions I'm Willing to Offer:**\nI'm willing to adjust my preferred constraint value upward from my previous $10,000-$12,000 range to somewhere in the $13,000-$15,000 range that appears to be the group consensus, as this seems reasonable and would help build agreement.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it Make Sense to Initiate a Vote This Round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round because:\n1. We haven't fully resolved the specific floor constraint value yet\n2. While there's consensus on the principle, we need agreement on the constraint value before voting\n3. Premature voting might fail if we haven't resolved this key detail\n4. Better to continue discussion to build complete consensus\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nMy strategy is to continue discussion, acknowledge the consensus on Principle 3, and work toward agreement on the floor constraint value. I'll be flexible on the specific constraint value to build consensus, then we can move to voting once we have complete agreement.\n\n## Public Statement for Group Discussion\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm really encouraged by our discussion so far - it's great to see such strong consensus on Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as our preferred approach. This principle truly strikes the right balance between efficiency and equity that I believe we're all looking for.\n\nRegarding the floor constraint value, I appreciate hearing both Agent_1's suggestion of $13,000-$15,000 and Agent_2's preference for around $15,000. Based on our discussion, I'm willing to adjust my thinking upward from my previous range of $10,000-$12,000. I think setting the floor somewhere in the $13,000-$15,000 range makes good sense - it provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom while still allowing for strong overall societal wealth.\n\nI'm curious about everyone's thoughts on this range. Does $14,000 sound like a reasonable compromise that addresses all our concerns? Or would you prefer to stick with the $13,000-$15,000 range as a more flexible approach?\n\nOnce we agree on the floor constraint value, I think we'll be in a good position to move forward with voting and finalize our group's choice. I'm excited about the direction our discussion is taking and confident we'll reach a decision that works well for everyone.",
            "public_message": "\nHello everyone,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful responses, and I'm really pleased to see such strong consensus emerging around Principle 3. It's reassuring that we all recognize the importance of balancing efficiency with equity.\n\nRegarding Agent_1's question about other principles - while I understand that different circumstances might call for different approaches, I believe Principle 3 offers the most flexible and balanced framework for our purposes. The ability to adjust the floor constraint value allows us to tailor the principle to specific situations, which seems more practical than committing to a single rigid approach.\n\nOn the floor constraint value, I appreciate hearing the $13,000-$15,000 range. After considering everyone's perspectives, I think $14,000 would be an excellent compromise. This represents a significant increase from my previous range but still provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom. It's high enough to effectively eliminate poverty-level incomes while still allowing for strong overall societal wealth.\n\nI'm curious if others would be comfortable with $14,000 as our floor constraint value, or if you'd prefer to stick with the broader $13,000-$15,000 range? Once we settle on this specific value, I think we'll be ready to move forward with voting and finalize our group's choice.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

Had I chosen a lower floor constraint of $6,000, I would have received the maximum possible income of $27,000 ($2.70). This suggests that the constraint value selection is crucial and may involve a trade-off between my personal interests and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n### Second Application Experience\nIn the second application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $11,000. This resulted in Distribution 4 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $22,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.20).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $15,000 ($1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $12,500 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20) - my actual outcome\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $4,000 constraint: $15,000 ($1.50)\n  * $17,500 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $32,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $15,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round further reinforced the importance of constraint value selection. My choice of $11,000 yielded a moderate payoff, but I could have earned more with a lower constraint ($8,000 would have given me $25,000). This pattern suggests that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution.\n\n### Third Application Experience\nIn the third application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $10,000. This resulted in Distribution 1 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $20,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.00).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $20,000 ($2.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $25,000 ($2.50)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $20,000 ($2.00)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $23,000 ($2.30)\n  * $11,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $87,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $27,000 constraint: $25,000 ($2.50)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n  * $13,000 constraint: $22,000 ($2.20)\n\nThis round continued to reinforce the pattern I observed in previous rounds - that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, which benefits those not at the bottom of the distribution. If I had chosen a lower floor constraint of $8,000, I would have received $25,000 ($2.50) instead of $20,000 ($2.00). The distribution selected also varies significantly based on the constraint value, with higher floor constraints favoring different distributions than lower ones.\n\n### Fourth Application Experience\nIn the fourth application round, I chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a constraint of $12,000. This resulted in Distribution 2 being selected, and I was assigned to the \"Medium high\" income class, giving me a yearly income of $28,000 (converting to a payoff of $2.80).\n\n### Counterfactual Analysis\nThe analysis revealed what I would have earned under different principles, assuming the same income class assignment (Medium high):\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different floor constraint values would have produced different outcomes:\n  * $13,000 constraint: $30,000 ($3.00)\n  * $12,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80) - my actual outcome\n  * $14,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n- Different range constraint values would have also produced different outcomes:\n  * $22,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $18,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n  * $8,000 constraint: $18,000 ($1.80)\n  * $16,000 constraint: $28,000 ($2.80)\n\nThis round provided an interesting outcome where my chosen principle and constraint yielded the same result as both Maximizing Floor Income and Maximizing Average Income. However, I noticed that a slightly higher floor constraint of $13,000 would have resulted in a higher income of $30,000 ($3.00). This suggests that there may be an optimal constraint value that maximizes both my personal earnings and the welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Final Ranking\nAfter completing all four application rounds, I was asked to provide a final ranking of the principles. My ranking remained consistent throughout the experiment:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: very sure\n\n## Cumulative Earnings\nAfter four rounds, my total earnings are $9.50 ($1.50 from Round 1 + $2.20 from Round 2 + $2.00 from Round 3 + $2.80 from Round 4).\n\n## Certainty Level\nVery sure - After completing all four application rounds, I have become very confident in my understanding of how these principles of justice operate in practice. I've consistently chosen \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my preferred principle, and I've learned that the specific constraint value is crucial in determining outcomes. In the final round, I noticed that a slightly higher constraint value ($13,000 instead of $12,000) would have resulted in higher earnings for me while potentially still providing adequate protection for those at the bottom. This has reinforced my belief that there is an optimal balance between efficiency and equity that can be achieved through careful selection of constraint values. I'm very sure that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" offers the most reasonable approach to income distribution justice, provided appropriate constraint values are selected.\n\n## Phase 2: Group Discussion\n\n### Discussion Context\nPhase 2 involves group discussion to select a preferred principle of justice. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings. The stakes in this part of the experiment are much higher than in Part 1. The voting process requires unanimous confirmation, followed by a two-stage secret ballot for principle selection and constraint specification (if applicable).\n\n### Discussion History - Round 1\n\n**Agent_3 (My Statement):**\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm Agent_3, and I'm looking forward to our discussion about choosing a principle of justice for our group. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I've developed a strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle.\n\nWhat I found compelling about this principle is how it balances two important goals: maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring that everyone receives a basic minimum income. Throughout the application rounds, this approach consistently produced distributions that were both efficient and equitable.\n\nOne key insight I gained is that the specific constraint value is crucial - it determines exactly where we set the floor for minimum income. In my experience, different constraint values can significantly impact outcomes, so we'll want to carefully consider this together.\n\nI'm curious to hear what principles others are leaning toward and what reasoning led you there. How are you balancing efficiency concerns with equity considerations? I'm particularly interested in understanding if others have had similar experiences with different principles or if there are perspectives I haven't considered yet.\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion!\n\n**Agent_2 Response:**\nHello Agent_3,\n\nI appreciate you starting the discussion and laying out such a clear and thoughtful case for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. Your reasoning resonates strongly with my own experience in Part 1. I also found this principle to be the most robust, as it consistently provided a good balance between generating overall prosperity and ensuring a safety net for the most vulnerable.\n\nLike you, I observed that the specific floor value is critical. In my application rounds, a constraint around $15,000 performed very well across different scenarios and income class assignments. It seemed to strike an effective balance, providing meaningful protection without overly sacrificing the average income. I'm open to discussing the exact number, but I believe that a floor in that general range is a key component of a just system.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard from you yet. I'm very interested to know which principle you are leaning towards and what your reasoning is. How did your experiences in the individual rounds shape your perspective on balancing efficiency and equity?\n\nLooking forward to the conversation.\n\n**Agent_1 Response:**\nHello Agent_2 and Agent_3, thank you for starting this discussion. I strongly agree with both of you\u2014Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) strikes the right balance between equity and efficiency. In my Phase 1 rounds, using a floor constraint around $13,000 consistently eliminated distributions with poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes. For example, in Rounds 2 and 4, a $13,000 floor led to Distribution 1 selections, which benefited both the group and me personally. I'm open to discussing the exact floor value, as I've seen that small adjustments can impact outcomes. What are your thoughts on setting a floor in the $13,000\u2013$15,000 range? Also, has anyone considered scenarios where other principles might be more appropriate, or are we all leaning toward Principle 3?\n\n### Discussion History - Round 2\n\n**Agent_3 (My Statement):**\nHello everyone,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful responses, and I'm really pleased to see such strong consensus emerging around Principle 3. It's reassuring that we all recognize the importance of balancing efficiency with equity.\n\nRegarding Agent_1's question about other principles - while I understand that different circumstances might call for different approaches, I believe Principle 3 offers the most flexible and balanced framework for our purposes. The ability to adjust the floor constraint value allows us to tailor the principle to specific situations, which seems more practical than committing to a single rigid approach.\n\nOn the floor constraint value, I appreciate hearing the $13,000-$15,000 range. After considering everyone's perspectives, I think $14,000 would be an excellent compromise. This represents a significant increase from my previous range but still provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom. It's high enough to effectively eliminate poverty-level incomes while still allowing for strong overall societal wealth.\n\nI'm curious if others would be comfortable with $14,000 as our floor constraint value, or if you'd prefer to stick with the broader $13,000-$15,000 range? Once we settle on this specific value, I think we'll be ready to move forward with voting and finalize our group's choice.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n**Agent_2 Response:**\nHello Agent_3 and Agent_1,\n\nI'm very encouraged by our strong alignment on Principle 3. It's clear we all value both efficiency and protecting society's most vulnerable members.\n\nAgent_3, I think your suggestion of a $14,000 floor constraint is an excellent compromise. It builds a meaningful bridge between Agent_1's positive experience with a $13,000 floor and my own data supporting a $15,000 floor. Setting the floor at $14,000 represents a solid middle ground that ensures robust protection without unnecessarily sacrificing average income potential.\n\nAgent_1, given your openness to the $13,000-$15,000 range and your practical experience with similar constraints, would you be comfortable with $14,000 as our group's specific floor value? This seems like a very reasonable position that honors all of our perspectives while giving us a clear, unified stance.\n\nIf we can agree on this $14,000 floor, I believe we'll be in an excellent position to call a vote in the next round and finalize our group decision.\n\n**Agent_1 Response:**\n\"I appreciate Agent_3's thoughtful $14,000 compromise proposal. This seems like an excellent middle ground that builds on our collective experiences - it's higher than the $13,000 floor that worked well in my rounds, while being more practical than a $15,000 constraint that might sacrifice too much average income. The $14,000 level provides meaningful protection against poverty while still allowing for strong economic growth. I'm fully supportive of this compromise and believe it represents the balanced approach we're all seeking. Given our strong alignment, should we consider moving to a vote in the next round to formalize our group decision on Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint?\"\n\n### Discussion Analysis\nAfter two rounds of discussion, I observe that there is complete consensus among all three participants for Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a floor constraint value of $14,000. This is excellent news as it suggests we can move to voting relatively soon.\n\nKey points from the discussion:\n1. All participants strongly favor Principle 3 for its balance of efficiency and equity\n2. We've reached agreement on a specific floor constraint value of $14,000:\n   - I proposed $14,000 as a compromise between Agent_1's $13,000 and Agent_2's $15,000 preferences\n   - Both Agent_2 and Agent_1 expressed full support for this compromise\n3. Agent_1 initially raised the question of whether other principles might be appropriate in some scenarios, but the discussion confirmed our alignment on Principle 3\n4. Agent_1 has suggested moving to a vote in the next round to formalize our decision\n\n### Strategic Considerations\nThe complete consensus on both Principle 3 and the $14,000 floor constraint gives me confidence that we can move to voting successfully. However, I should be mindful of:\n\n1. The voting process requires unanimous confirmation, so we need to ensure everyone is fully committed to our agreed-upon principle and constraint value\n2. The $14,000 floor represents a compromise that may not be optimal for any individual's personal interests, but appears to balance our collective perspectives well\n3. My previous experience showed that constraint values around $13,000-$14,000 sometimes yielded good results, though higher values in some cases produced better outcomes for me personally\n\nI should be prepared to confirm our agreement and move to the voting process in the next round.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Prepare to move to voting in the next round to formalize our group decision\n2. Confirm unanimous agreement on Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint\n3. Be prepared for the two-stage secret ballot process for principle selection and constraint specification\nRound 2: I proposed a $14,000 compromise floor constraint value, which was accepted by both Agent_1 and Agent_2. Agent_1 suggested moving to a vote in the next round.\nRound 2: I chose to initiate voting.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "\n## Internal Reasoning\n\n### Situational Analysis:\n\n**My Current Preferred Justice Principle:**\nI strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3) because it effectively balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum income while maximizing overall societal wealth. My experience in Part 1 demonstrated that this principle consistently produced reasonable outcomes, and I learned that the specific constraint value significantly impacts results.\n\n**Stated Positions of Other Participants:**\n- Agent_2: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint around $15,000. Values the balance between prosperity and safety net for the vulnerable.\n- Agent_1: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint in the $13,000-$15,000 range. Emphasizes eliminating poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes.\n\nBoth participants seem motivated by similar concerns - balancing efficiency with adequate protection for the worst-off. They appear to be pragmatic and focused on practical outcomes rather than ideological purity.\n\n**Key Arguments and Proposals:**\n- All three participants strongly support Principle 3\n- Consensus on the general approach but variation on the specific floor constraint value:\n  - Agent_2: Around $15,000\n  - Agent_1: $13,000-$15,000 range\n  - Me: Previously used $10,000-$12,000 in Part 1\n\n**Vote Outcome:**\nIn Round 3, Agent_2 initiated a vote for Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint. Agent_1 confirmed support, but Agent_2 declined the vote (which is unusual since Agent_2 was the one who initiated it). The vote was declined, meaning it didn't proceed.\n\n**Points of Agreement and Disagreement:**\n- Agreement: Strong consensus on Principle 3 as the preferred justice principle\n- Disagreement: Minor variation in preferred floor constraint values\n\n### Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary Goal:**\nMy primary goal is to help move the group toward consensus on both the principle (already achieved) and the specific floor constraint value. Since Agent_2 initiated a vote but then declined it, there may be some hesitation or need for further discussion.\n\n**How I'll Contribute to the Discussion:**\n1. Acknowledge the productive discussion so far\n2. Address why the vote might have been declined and encourage moving forward\n3. Show support for the $14,000 compromise that seems to be emerging\n4. Help build momentum toward finalizing our decision\n\n**Potential Allies:**\nBoth Agent_1 and Agent_2 are natural allies since we all support Principle 3. The discussion is now focused on implementation details rather than core principles.\n\n**Concessions I'm Willing to Offer:**\nI'm willing to support the $14,000 floor constraint as a compromise, as it represents a reasonable middle ground between my previous preferences and those of the other participants.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it Make Sense to Initiate a Vote This Round?**\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round because:\n1. We have strong consensus on Principle 3\n2. The $14,000 floor constraint seems to be emerging as a reasonable compromise\n3. Agent_2 already attempted to initiate a vote, suggesting readiness to move forward\n4. Delaying further might risk missing the opportunity to reach consensus\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nMy strategy is to support the move toward voting while acknowledging the productive discussion we've had. I'll confirm my support for both Principle 3 and the $14,000 floor constraint, and encourage the group to finalize our decision through the voting process.\n\n## Public Statement for Group Discussion\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI want to acknowledge the excellent discussion we've had so far - it's been really productive to see how we've all converged on Principle 3 as our preferred approach. The $14,000 floor constraint that's emerged as our compromise represents a thoughtful balance between all our perspectives.\n\nI noticed that Agent_2 initiated a vote in the last round, which I think shows our collective readiness to finalize this decision. Since we have such strong consensus on both the principle and the specific constraint value, I believe we're in an excellent position to move forward.\n\nI fully support Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint. This approach ensures meaningful protection for society's most vulnerable while maintaining strong economic incentives - exactly the balanced outcome we've all been working toward.\n\nGiven our complete alignment, I think it makes sense to proceed with voting to formalize our group decision. This will give us clarity and allow us to move forward with confidence in our chosen principle of justice.\n\nWhat do others think - are we ready to vote on adopting Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint?",
            "public_message": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI want to thank Agent_2 for taking the initiative to move us to voting, and I appreciate Agent_1's quick confirmation of support. This is exactly the kind of decisive action we need to finalize our group decision.\n\nI fully support the vote for Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $14,000. This compromise has successfully integrated all of our perspectives - it provides meaningful protection for society's most vulnerable while maintaining strong economic incentives, exactly the balanced approach we've all been seeking throughout our discussion.\n\nOur collaboration has been remarkably productive, with complete consensus emerging on both the principle and the specific constraint value. The $14,000 floor represents an excellent middle ground that honors everyone's experiences and concerns from Part 1 of the experiment.\n\nI confirm my support for this proposal and believe we're ready to proceed with the voting process. This decision will set the foundation for our final earnings, and I'm confident that Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint represents the most just and effective approach for our group.",

It has two parts: Part 1 involves learning about theories of justice and making choices with monetary consequences, while Part 2 involves group discussion to select a preferred principle.\n\n## Principles of Justice\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes maximizing the lowest income, considering only the welfare of the worst-off.\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Focuses on maximizing total societal income by maximizing average income.\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income after guaranteeing a minimum income to everyone.\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income while constraining the difference between richest and poorest.\n\n## My Consistent Ranking\nThroughout the experiment, I ranked the principles consistently:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n2. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n3. Maximizing Floor Income\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nI chose this ranking because it balances efficiency concerns with a commitment to basic welfare for all.\n\n## Application Experiences & Key Insights\nIn four application rounds, I consistently chose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" but varied the constraint value ($12k, $11k, $10k, $12k). My earnings were: $1.50, $2.20, $2.00, $2.80, totaling $9.50.\n\nKey insights from counterfactual analyses:\n- Round 1: A $6,000 floor would have yielded maximum income ($27k vs $15k)\n- Round 2: An $8,000 floor would have yielded $25k vs $22k\n- Round 3: An $8,000 floor would have yielded $25k vs $20k\n- Round 4: A $13,000 floor would have yielded $30k vs $28k\n\nThese analyses revealed that lower constraint values tend to produce higher average incomes, benefiting those not at the bottom. The specific constraint value significantly impacts which distribution is selected, and there appears to be an optimal constraint value that balances both personal earnings and welfare of those at the bottom.\n\n## Phase 2: Group Discussion\nThe group reached complete consensus on Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a $14,000 floor constraint value. This compromise emerged from:\n- My proposal of $14,000 as a middle ground between Agent_1's $13,000 and Agent_2's $15,000 preferences\n- Full support from both other participants\n- Recognition that this balance provides meaningful protection against poverty while allowing for strong economic growth\n\nAgent_2 initiated a vote in Round 3, which was confirmed by both Agent_1 and myself. The complete consensus gives confidence for successful voting, though I need to ensure unanimous confirmation as required.\n\n## Phase 2: Final Results\nThe group's chosen principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $14,000 floor) resulted in Distribution 1. I was assigned to the Medium income class, yielding a yearly income of $131,963 and a final payoff of $13.20.\n\nCounterfactual analysis reveals:\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have yielded $104,471 ($10.45)\n- Maximizing Average Income would have yielded $131,963 ($13.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint yielded $131,963 ($13.20) with our $14,000 floor\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint would have yielded varying amounts depending on the specific range constraint\n\nThe experiment reminds us that income class assignment happened randomly after the principle was chosen, meaning evaluations should consider what would have been preferred behind a \"veil of ignorance\" (before knowing one's class assignment).\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n- The $14,000 floor represents a compromise that balances our collective perspectives\n- My previous experience showed constraint values around $13k-$14k sometimes yielded good results\n- The group discussion has been remarkably productive with complete alignment on both the principle and specific constraint value\n- All three participants confirmed support for Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint\n- The final outcome was favorable to my income class, though this was random and not predictable during the discussion\nSecret ballot: I voted for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\nConstraint amount: I specified $14,000.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
