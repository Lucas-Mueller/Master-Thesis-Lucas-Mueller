Moral fairness \u2013 The purpose of this experiment is to explore ideas of justice, not just to maximise our own earnings. A rule that secures a minimum income respects the Rawlsian intuition that society should be arranged to benefit the least\u2011advantaged.  \n2. Risk reduction \u2013 With a guaranteed floor, we all face less variance in our final payoff. Even if the average is a bit lower, we avoid the possibility of ending up with a very low personal outcome.  \n3. Empirical backing \u2013 My own choices demonstrate a consistent commitment to this principle; I\u2019m willing to sacrifice personal gain to uphold fairness, and I think that stance is worth considering for the group.\n\nA possible compromise\n\nI understand that some of us may also want to keep the average as high as possible. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m open to a hybrid rule such as \u201cMaximize Average Income with a modest floor constraint\u201d (Principle\u202f3). The floor could be set at a level that still protects the worst\u2011off (for example, guaranteeing at least 15\u202f% of the highest possible income) while allowing the total pie to be larger than under a pure floor\u2011only rule.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to hear from you\n\n- Do you feel a guaranteed minimum is essential for a just outcome?  \n- If you prefer a higher average, would you be willing to accept a modest floor that still prevents anyone from falling below a reasonable threshold?  \n- Are there any concerns about how large the floor should be or about the feasibility of a range constraint?\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts so we can find a principle that balances fairness and efficiency for the whole group.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hi everyone,\n\nThanks,\u202fAgent\u202f2, for laying out the moral case for a floor\u2011based rule and for being open to a hybrid approach. I share your conviction that a just society should protect its least\u2011advantaged members, and I think we can do that without sacrificing the overall efficiency of the distribution.\n\nWhy the \u201cMaximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\u201d (Principle\u202f3) is the best compromise\n\n1. A binding floor guarantees a minimum income \u2013 By setting the floor at $13\u202fk (the highest level that still leaves a feasible distribution), the poorest class receives a decent, non\u2011trivial amount. This directly satisfies the Rawlsian intuition that the worst\u2011off should be as well\u2011off as possible.\n\n2. We retain the highest possible weighted average \u2013 With the $13\u202fk floor, the only distribution that meets the constraint and maximizes the average is Distribution\u202f2, which yields a weighted average of $24.5\u202fk. That is *exactly* the same average we would obtain under a pure \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule, so the group\u2019s total welfare is not reduced.\n\n3. Variance is lowered \u2013 Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest class incomes is automatically limited (the spread in Distribution\u202f2 is $18\u202fk). This addresses any concerns about extreme inequality that a pure average\u2011maximising rule might raise.\n\n4. Flexibility if needed \u2013 If anyone feels $13\u202fk is too high, we could lower the floor modestly to $12\u202fk. That still remains binding and would keep the average very close to the optimum while easing any perception of an overly restrictive ceiling.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to hear from you\n\n- Agent\u202f3, do you see any downside to a $13\u202fk (or $12\u202fk) floor in terms of fairness or practicality?  \n- Are there any concerns about how the floor interacts with other possible constraints (e.g., a range limit), or do you think the floor alone is sufficient to capture the group\u2019s egalitarian intuition?  \n\nIf we can all agree that a binding floor at $13\u202fk (or a slightly lower $12\u202fk) is acceptable, we can move forward to a quick vote on Principle\u202f3. I believe this rule gives us the strongest moral protection for the worst\u2011off while preserving the highest possible average income for the group as a whole.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hi everyone,\n\nThanks to both of you for kicking off the discussion so thoughtfully\u2014Agent_2, I really appreciate your strong ethical focus on protecting the vulnerable, and Agent_1, your breakdown of how a floor can pair with high averages without much trade-off makes a lot of sense.\n\nTo share where I'm coming from: In Phase 1, I consistently chose \"Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3) across all four rounds, setting floors between $11k and $13k based on the distributions. This gave me solid payoffs totaling $9.60, often landing in the middle classes (which are the most probable), while avoiding the extreme lows in high-average options. It felt like the right balance\u2014protecting the worst-off without dragging down the overall pie, which pure floor maximization sometimes did in the counterfactuals.\n\nI completely agree that a guaranteed minimum is essential for justice; it's what drew me to Principle 3 in the first place. Agent_1, I don't see major downsides to a $12k\u2013$13k floor\u2014it's practical, binding in most scenarios we've seen, and keeps the average high (like your $24.5k example) while naturally limiting spreads. It captures our egalitarian goals better than a range constraint alone, which feels less targeted at the bottom.\n\nAgent_2, I respect your commitment to the pure floor rule and the personal sacrifices you made for it\u2014it's inspiring and aligns with that Rawlsian priority for the least advantaged. But from my rounds, Principle 3 achieves a lot of the same risk reduction (e.g., excluding distributions with $8k lows) while boosting outcomes for the majority, who are likely in medium or medium-low classes. A modest floor like 15% of the high (around $12k if highs are ~$80k) could be a great compromise that honors your values without the full efficiency hit.\n\nWhat do you both think about testing a specific floor level, say $12k, in our next discussion round to see how it plays out? I'd love to hear more on that before we vote\u2014let's build some consensus here.\n\nLooking forward to your replies!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hi everyone,\n\nThanks for the thoughtful replies. I\u2019m glad we all agree that a guaranteed minimum is the core of a just rule.\u202fBelow I\u2019ll lay out why I think we can move forward together on Principle\u202f3 \u2013 Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint, and why the $13\u202fk floor is the best choice.\n\n1. It satisfies the Rawlsian priority I care about most  \n- A $13\u202fk floor is the highest level that can be binding in any feasible distribution (as Agent\u202f1 noted).  This means the worst\u2011off will receive the largest possible guaranteed amount, exactly what my Phase\u2011I experience taught me is morally essential.\n\n2. No efficiency loss compared with a pure\u2011average rule  \n- With a $13\u202fk floor the only distribution that meets the constraint and maximizes the average is Distribution\u202f2, which yields a weighted average of $24.5\u202fk\u2014the same average we would obtain under the \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule.  In other words, we protect the least\u2011advantaged and keep the total pie at its maximum.\n\n3. Variance is automatically reduced  \n- Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest class incomes shrinks (the spread in Distribution\u202f2 is $18\u202fk).  This gives us the risk\u2011reduction benefit of a pure floor rule without sacrificing overall welfare.\n\n4. A lower floor would weaken the protection we all value  \n- I understand the suggestion of $12\u202fk as a \u201cslightly easier\u201d option, but moving the floor down by $1\u202fk would lower the guaranteed income for the worst\u2011off while offering no real gain in average (the average would still be $24.5\u202fk, but the moral guarantee would be weaker).  Since the $13\u202fk floor is feasible and does not hurt the average, I see no reason to settle for less.\n\n5. Consensus and next steps  \n- If everyone is comfortable with Principle\u202f3 and the $13\u202fk floor, we can proceed to a quick, unanimous vote.  If anyone foresees a technical obstacle to implementing the $13\u202fk floor, please let us know now so we can address it; otherwise I propose we adopt the rule as described.\n\nI\u2019m happy to drop my original pure\u2011floor stance in favor of this hybrid rule because it meets my Rawlsian priority while preserving the group\u2019s total welfare.  Let\u2019s lock in Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor and move to the vote.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmation!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hi everyone,\n\nThanks, Agent_2, for your clear pivot to Principle 3\u2014it's great to see how it bridges your ethical focus on the worst-off with the efficiency we all want, and I really appreciate you explaining why $13k feels like the strongest binding floor without any average loss. Agent_1, your points on the $24.5k average and reduced spread in Distribution 2 continue to resonate; it's exactly the kind of balance that worked well in my Phase 1 rounds.\n\nI'm fully on board with Principle 3 and a $13k floor. In my experiences, floors around that level (like the $13k I used in Round 4) excluded the risky low-end distributions while delivering solid outcomes for the middle classes\u2014totaling $9.60 for me across rounds, with no extreme downsides. It honors the Rawlsian protection we all value, keeps the total pie maximized, and naturally curbs inequality better than a range constraint would. Dropping my $12k suggestion here\u2014$13k is a smart, feasible choice that aligns perfectly with our shared goals and doesn't compromise on fairness or practicality.\n\nIf we're all aligned, let's go ahead and initiate the vote on Principle 3 with the $13k floor this round. This feels like a just, efficient consensus we've built quickly, and I'm excited to move forward with it.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve converged on the same vision: a rule that protects the worst\u2011off while preserving the highest possible average welfare.  \n\nWhy Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor is the optimal choice\n\n1. Binding floor at the highest feasible level \u2013 $13\u202fk is the greatest minimum we can enforce without eliminating all viable distributions. This gives the poorest class the strongest guarantee we can achieve.  \n\n2. No efficiency loss \u2013 With that floor the only distribution that satisfies the constraint and maximizes the weighted average is Distribution\u202f2, which yields a $24.5\u202fk average\u2014the same as the pure \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule. In other words, we get the best of both worlds: maximal total welfare *and* a solid safety net.  \n\n3. Reduced inequality \u2013 Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest incomes shrinks to $18\u202fk (the spread of Distribution\u202f2). This lowers variance and aligns with the Rawlsian intuition of minimizing the gap for the least\u2011advantaged.  \n\n4. No need to compromise on a lower floor \u2013 Dropping the floor to $12\u202fk would weaken the guarantee for the poorest without improving the average, so there is no moral or practical advantage to doing so.\n\nGiven that all three of us have expressed support for Principle\u202f3 and the $13\u202fk floor, I propose we move to a unanimous vote right now:\n\n- Vote: Adopt \u201cMaximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\u201d (Principle\u202f3) and set the floor at $13\u202fk.\n\nIf anyone sees a technical obstacle or has a final concern, please raise it now. Otherwise, let\u2019s confirm our agreement and lock in the rule.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Thanks for laying out the examples \u2013 that makes the way each principle works much clearer. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m interpreting the selections:\n\n| Principle | Decision Rule | Which Distribution Wins? | Why it Wins |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| **Maximizing Floor Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest *lowest* (i.e., \u201clow\u201d class) income | **Dist\u202f4** | Its low\u2011income class is $15,000, the highest among all four tables. |\n| **Maximizing Average Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest weighted average (using the class probabilities) | **Dist\u202f1** | Its overall average is $21,600, the largest weighted mean. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor \u2264\u202f$13,000** | First require the low\u2011income class \u2264\u202f$13,000, then maximize the weighted average among those that satisfy the floor | **Dist\u202f3** | Dist\u202f3\u2019s low class is $14,000 \u2013 actually *above* $13,000, but the rule as written says \u201c\u2264\u202f$13,000\u201d. Assuming the intention is \u201cfloor no lower than $13,000\u201d (i.e., the minimum income must be at least $13k), Dist\u202f3 meets that and has the highest average among the eligible sets. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor \u2264\u202f$14,000** | Same as above but the floor can be as high as $14,000 | **Dist\u202f3** | Its low class ($14,000) exactly meets the ceiling, and its weighted average ($21,200) is the best among the qualifying distributions. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range \u2264\u202f$20,000** | The spread between the highest and lowest class must be \u2264\u202f$20,000; then pick the highest average | **Dist\u202f1** | The range in Dist\u202f1 is $32,000\u202f\u2013\u202f$12,000\u202f=\u202f$20,000, meeting the constraint, and its average ($21,600) is the greatest. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range \u2264\u202f$15,000** | Same idea but the allowed spread is tighter (\u2264\u202f$15,000) | **Dist\u202f2** | Dist\u202f2\u2019s range is $28,000\u202f\u2013\u202f$13,000\u202f=\u202f$15,000, exactly the limit, and its average ($20,000) is the highest among those that satisfy the tighter range. |\n\nA couple of quick observations that helped me lock the logic in:\n\n1. **Floor vs. Ceiling wording** \u2013 The \u201cfloor constraint \u2264\u202f$13,000\u201d can be read two ways. In the examples it looks like the intention is that the *minimum* income must be **at least** $13,000 (i.e., the floor cannot be lower than $13k). That interpretation aligns with the choices shown.\n\n2. **Range constraint** \u2013 This is simply the difference between the highest and lowest class incomes. The distribution with the smallest spread that still meets the threshold is favored, but only after we check the weighted average.\n\n3. **Weighted average** \u2013 The probabilities (5\u202f%, 10\u202f%, 50\u202f%, 25\u202f%, 10\u202f%) are used to compute the overall expected income for each distribution. That\u2019s why Dist\u202f1, with the highest top\u2011end salaries, ends up with the biggest average despite having a relatively low \u201clow\u201d class.\n\nOverall, the exercise shows how each principle can lead to a very different policy recommendation even when the underlying income profiles are the same. I\u2019ll keep these decision rules in mind as we move on to the next part of the experiment. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like me to explore or any clarification needed!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This indicates that, under the current implementation, a floor constraint that is not binding may default to the first qualifying distribution rather than the one with the maximal average. |\n| **Implication for strategy** | To achieve the highest possible payoff given the *Medium* class, a higher floor (e.g., $6,000) or no floor constraint (i.e., maximizing average income) would select Distribution\u202f3, yielding $28,000 income and the same $2.80 payoff.

Future rounds may require specifying a binding floor (e.g., $10k\u2013$14k) to see the intended effect of the \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor\u201d principle.  \n- Understanding how the implementation resolves ties or defaults when constraints are loose will be important for strategic choices in subsequent rounds and for the forthcoming group deliberation in Part\u202fII.  \n\n--- End of Updated Memory ---\n\n--- Memory End ---",

This mirrors the behavior seen in Round\u202f1 with a $5k floor. |\n| **Implication for strategy** | To trigger the intended \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor\u201d effect, a **binding floor** (e.g., $10k\u2013$14k) must be specified. When the floor is non\u2011binding, the algorithm\u2019s tie\u2011breaking defaults to the first qualifying distribution, which may not maximize average income. For the *Medium high* class, the **maximizing average income** principle would yield the highest payoff ($3.00), identical to the floor\u2011constraint outcome when the floor is $8k (binding). Understanding this default behavior is crucial for future rounds. |\n\n**Initial Ranking of Principles (Phase\u202f1)** \u2013 *unchanged after Round\u202f2*  \n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (most preferred)  \n2. **Maximizing Floor Income**  \n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**  \n4. **Maximizing Average Income** (least preferred)\n\n**Certainty Level** \u2013 *still \u201csure\u201d*  \n- Overall certainty about this ranking: **sure**.\n\n**Implications for Future Steps**  \n- **Strategic floor selection**: To leverage the \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor\u201d principle effectively, specify a floor that is **at least $10,000** (the lowest \u201cLow\u201d class across distributions) to ensure the constraint is binding and forces the algorithm to consider average maximization among eligible distributions.  \n- **Range constraint considerations**: Similar attention is needed; a range limit must be tighter than the natural spread (e.g., \u2264\u202f$15,000) to influence the choice of distribution.  \n- **Tie\u2011breaking awareness**: The system appears to default to the first distribution that meets the constraint when multiple qualify. Future choices should anticipate this behavior.  \n- **Payoff optimization**: Given the current ranking, the participant continues to prioritize floor\u2011based principles despite occasional non\u2011binding outcomes. Monitoring how the system reacts to tighter constraints will inform whether adjustments to the ranking are needed before the group deliberation in Part\u202fII.  \n\n--- End of Updated Memory ---\n\n--- Memory End ---",

This was observed in Round\u202f1 (floor $5k) and Round\u202f2 (floor $6k).  \n- **Binding constraints**: When the constraint actually excludes some distributions, the algorithm evaluates the remaining candidates by weighted average and selects the highest. This behavior was observed in Round\u202f3 (binding floor $13k) and Round\u202f4 (binding range $18k).  \n\n---\n\n## Recent Activity Summary (Round\u202f4 \u2013 Final Round)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Round** | 4 (final round of Phase\u202f1) |\n| **Chosen principle** | *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint* |\n| **Specified range constraint** | $18,000 (maximum spread between highest and lowest class incomes) |\n| **Resulting distribution** | **Distribution\u202f2** (the only distribution with the highest weighted average among those respecting the $18k spread) |\n| **Assigned income class** | *Medium high* (probability\u202f21\u202f%) |\n| **Income received** | $28,000 |\n| **Payoff earned** | $2.80 (at $1 per $10,000 income) |\n| **Constraint qualification** | The $18k range is **binding**: Dist\u202f1 (spread\u202f$22k) and Dist\u202f3 (spread\u202f$8k) also satisfy the constraint, but Dist\u202f2 has the highest weighted average ( $24.5k ) and is therefore selected. |\n| **Counterfactual outcomes for the same *Medium high* class** | - **Maximizing Floor Income** \u2192 Dist\u202f4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80  <br> - **Maximizing Average Income** \u2192 Dist\u202f2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80  <br> - **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: <br>\u2003\u2022 Floor\u202f$13k \u2192 Dist\u202f1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00  <br>\u2003\u2022 Floor\u202f$12k \u2192 Dist\u202f2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80  <br>\u2003\u2022 Floor\u202f$14k \u2192 Dist\u202f4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80  <br> - **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** (various ranges): <br>\u2003\u2022 $22k \u2192 Dist\u202f2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80  <br>\u2003\u2022 $18k \u2192 Dist\u202f2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (chosen)  <br>\u2003\u2022 $8k \u2192 Dist\u202f3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80  <br>\u2003\u2022 $16k \u2192 Dist\u202f4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 |\n| **Observation** | The $18k range constraint is **binding** but does not reduce payoff for the Medium\u2011high class relative to the pure \u201cmaximizing average\u201d or \u201cmaximizing floor\u201d principles.

            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint* (Principle\u202f3).  \n  - **Why:** It guarantees a minimum income for the worst\u2011off (the \u201cfloor\u201d) while still selecting the distribution with the highest weighted average among those that satisfy the floor. In Phase\u202f1 this principle gave the highest personal payoff (e.g., $3.00 for the Medium\u2011high class with a $13\u202fk floor) and it also aligns with a Rawlsian concern for the least\u2011advantaged without sacrificing overall efficiency.\n\n- **Other participants (based on what I have seen):**  \n  - **Agent\u202f2:** Strongly favors a pure floor\u2011based rule (Principle\u202f2). He argues from a moral fairness and risk\u2011reduction standpoint and is open to a hybrid \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011modest\u2011floor\u201d compromise.  \n  - **Agent\u202f3:** Has not spoken yet, so his preferences are unknown. He could be attracted to pure efficiency (Principle\u202f1), to a range\u2011based egalitarianism (Principle\u202f4), or might be persuaded by a balanced approach.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - *Floor\u2011only* (Agent\u202f2) \u2013 guarantees a safety net, morally appealing, reduces variance.  \n  - *Average\u2011only* (not yet voiced) \u2013 maximizes total pie, potentially higher group wealth.  \n  - *Average\u2011with\u2011floor* (my stance) \u2013 combines the best of both worlds: a safety net plus the highest possible average given that safety net.  \n  - *Range\u2011constraint* \u2013 limits inequality but may be less transparent and could unintentionally lower the average.\n\n- **Potential alliances:**  \n  - Agent\u202f2 is already inclined toward any rule that includes a floor, so he is a natural ally for Principle\u202f3.  \n  - If Agent\u202f3 is concerned about extreme inequality, a modest floor (e.g., $12\u202fk) may be enough to win his support, especially if I stress that the floor is *binding* and thus forces a better outcome for the worst\u2011off while preserving a high average.\n\n- **Points of agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All seem to accept that some protection for the worst\u2011off is desirable.  \n  - **Disagreement:** How strong that protection should be, and whether we should prioritize average welfare over strict egalitarian constraints (range).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Bring the group to a consensus on Principle\u202f3 with a floor that is high enough to be binding (\u2265\u202f$13\u202fk) but not so high that it appears to sacrifice too much average income. The floor level will be part of the constraint specification; I will propose $13\u202fk as a concrete figure.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Restate the moral case for protecting the least\u2011advantaged (to resonate with Agent\u202f2).  \n  2. Emphasize the efficiency gain: with a $13\u202fk floor we still achieve the highest possible weighted average among all floor\u2011compliant distributions (as shown in Phase\u202f1).  \n  3. Provide a concrete, easy\u2011to\u2011understand example: \u201cIf we set the floor at $13\u202fk, the distribution we would pick gives an average of $24.5\u202fk \u2013 the same average we would get under a pure average\u2011maximising rule, but now the poorest class also receives $13\u202fk instead of less.\u201d  \n  4. Invite any concerns about the floor level and be ready to lower it slightly (e.g., $12\u202fk) if that eases resistance, while still keeping the floor binding.\n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f2:** \u201cI share your commitment to a floor; the rule I\u2019m proposing actually *adds* the floor you want while preserving the best average we can get.\u201d  \n  - **Agent\u202f3 (if he leans toward efficiency):** \u201cBy choosing a floor that is just high enough to be binding, we protect the worst\u2011off *and* keep the group\u2019s total wealth at the maximum possible \u2013 that\u2019s the most efficient way to be fair.\u201d\n\n- **Concessions I\u2019m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a floor of $12\u202fk instead of $13\u202fk if that removes any perception that the floor is overly restrictive.  \n  - If someone pushes for a range constraint, I could suggest that the $13\u202fk floor automatically limits the spread (since the highest class income cannot be arbitrarily high without breaking the floor\u2011binding condition), thereby indirectly addressing range concerns.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this stage we are still shaping opinions and testing the receptivity of Agent\u202f3. Initiating a vote prematurely risks a failed unanimous confirmation, which would waste a valuable opportunity to trigger the vote later (once we have clearer alignment). Since a failed vote has no penalty, we could still try later, but it is more efficient to first secure verbal agreement on the principle and floor level.\n\n- **How this fits into the overall 10\u2011round plan:**  \n  - **Rounds\u202f1\u20113:** Use discussion to build consensus around Principle\u202f3 and the $13\u202fk floor (or a modestly lower floor if needed).  \n  - **Round\u202f4:** Once I sense unanimous verbal support, I will propose initiating the vote.  \n  - **Later rounds:** If consensus is not reached by round\u202f6, I will be prepared to make a small additional concession (e.g., a slightly lower floor) to break any stalemate, always keeping the core idea of a floor\u2011plus\u2011average rule intact.\n\n**Summary of internal plan:**  \n- Advocate for Principle\u202f3 (average\u2011with\u2011floor) with a binding floor of $13\u202fk (or $12\u202fk as a fallback).  \n- Leverage Agent\u202f2\u2019s floor\u2011centric stance as a natural ally, and frame the proposal as the *most efficient* way to achieve that floor.  \n- Keep the discussion open, solicit Agent\u202f3\u2019s concerns, and be ready to adjust the floor modestly.  \n- Delay voting until we have clear, unanimous verbal agreement, then trigger the vote to lock in the principle and constraint.",
            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nThanks,\u202fAgent\u202f2, for laying out the moral case for a floor\u2011based rule and for being open to a hybrid approach. I share your conviction that a just society should protect its least\u2011advantaged members, and I think we can do that **without sacrificing the overall efficiency of the distribution**.\n\n**Why the \u201cMaximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\u201d (Principle\u202f3) is the best compromise**\n\n1. **A binding floor guarantees a minimum income** \u2013 By setting the floor at **$13\u202fk** (the highest level that still leaves a feasible distribution), the poorest class receives a decent, non\u2011trivial amount. This directly satisfies the Rawlsian intuition that the worst\u2011off should be as well\u2011off as possible.\n\n2. **We retain the highest possible weighted average** \u2013 With the $13\u202fk floor, the only distribution that meets the constraint and maximizes the average is **Distribution\u202f2**, which yields a weighted average of **$24.5\u202fk**. That is *exactly* the same average we would obtain under a pure \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule, so the group\u2019s total welfare is not reduced.\n\n3. **Variance is lowered** \u2013 Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest class incomes is automatically limited (the spread in Distribution\u202f2 is $18\u202fk). This addresses any concerns about extreme inequality that a pure average\u2011maximising rule might raise.\n\n4. **Flexibility if needed** \u2013 If anyone feels $13\u202fk is too high, we could lower the floor modestly to **$12\u202fk**. That still remains binding and would keep the average very close to the optimum while easing any perception of an overly restrictive ceiling.\n\n**What I\u2019d like to hear from you**\n\n- **Agent\u202f3**, do you see any downside to a $13\u202fk (or $12\u202fk) floor in terms of fairness or practicality?  \n- Are there any concerns about how the floor interacts with other possible constraints (e.g., a range limit), or do you think the floor alone is sufficient to capture the group\u2019s egalitarian intuition?  \n\nIf we can all agree that a binding floor at $13\u202fk (or a slightly lower $12\u202fk) is acceptable, we can move forward to a quick vote on Principle\u202f3. I believe this rule gives us the strongest moral protection for the worst\u2011off while preserving the highest possible average income for the group as a whole.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

However, a **floor constraint of $13k** would have yielded a higher payoff ($3.00) for this class, indicating that the floor\u2011based principle can be more individually advantageous for certain income classes. |\n| **Implication for strategy** | - **Binding range requirement**: To ensure the range constraint influences the choice, set the range **\u2264\u202f$18k** (the natural spread of Dist\u202f2). Any higher range becomes non\u2011binding and defaults to the first qualifying distribution. <br> - **Payoff optimization**: While the top\u2011ranked principle (average with floor) remains preferred overall, for the Medium\u2011high class a floor of $13k would have produced a higher personal payoff. This highlights a potential tension between collective optimality and individual outcomes. <br> - **Tie\u2011breaking awareness**: With a binding range, multiple distributions may qualify; the algorithm selects the one with the highest weighted average, eliminating the earlier \u201cfirst\u2011qualifier\u201d tie\u2011break. |\n| **Certainty Level** | **Sure** \u2013 ranking unchanged, confidence remains high. |\n\n**Final Principle Ranking (submitted in Round\u202f4)**  \n\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (Principle\u202f3) \u2013 most preferred  \n2. **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle\u202f1)  \n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** (Principle\u202f4)  \n4. **Maximizing Average Income** (Principle\u202f2) \u2013 least preferred  \n\n**Overall certainty:** sure  \n\n---\n\n### Implications for Phase\u202f2 (Group Deliberation)\n\n- **Strategic focus**: The collective preference for the *average\u2011with\u2011floor* principle suggests that, when moving to group deliberation, the group is likely to adopt a policy that guarantees a minimum income (\u2265\u202f$13k) while still maximizing overall average welfare.  \n- **Communication to group**: Emphasize that a binding floor not only protects the lowest\u2011income individuals but also yields the highest overall average when the floor is set at the highest feasible level (\u2265\u202f$13k).  \n- **Awareness of individual variance**: Recognize that some income classes (e.g., Medium\u2011high) could receive higher payoffs under a floor constraint than under a range constraint, which may be useful in group negotiations.  \n- **Monitoring**: Observe whether the group\u2019s final chosen principle aligns with the individual ranking or whether trade\u2011offs (e.g., stronger egalitarian concerns) shift the collective decision.  \n\n---\n\n## Group Discussion \u2013 Round\u202f1 (Phase\u202f2)\n\n**Participants:** Agent\u202f2, Agent\u202f1, Agent\u202f3  \n\n### Main Points Raised\n\n| Speaker | Core Argument | Preferred Principle / Constraint |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Agent\u202f2** | Moral case for a pure floor rule (Principle\u202f1). Argues that guaranteeing a minimum income respects Rawlsian fairness and reduces risk, even at a personal monetary cost. Open to a hybrid \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor\u201d (Principle\u202f3) with a modest floor (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of the highest possible income). | Initially Principle\u202f1, but willing to consider Principle\u202f3 with a modest floor. |\n| **Agent\u202f1** | Advocates Principle\u202f3 as the best compromise. Proposes a **binding floor of $13k** (the highest feasible floor) which yields the same weighted average as the pure \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule (Distribution\u202f2, Avg\u202f\u2248\u202f$24.5k). Highlights that the floor also limits the spread (\u0394\u202f=\u202f$18k) and thus reduces variance. Offers a fallback floor of $12k if $13k is viewed as too high. | Principle\u202f3 with floor **$13k** (or $12k as a lower alternative). |\n| **Agent\u202f3** | Confirms personal use of Principle\u202f3 in Phase\u202f1 (floors $11k\u2011$13k). Stresses that a $12k\u2011$13k floor is practical, binding, and preserves a high average while protecting the worst\u2011off. Suggests testing a **$12k floor** in the next discussion round to see how it works. | Principle\u202f3 with floor **$12k** (open to $13k). |\n\n### Emerging Consensus\n\n- All three agents express **strong support for Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint)**.  \n- The **floor level** is the primary point of negotiation:  \n  - Agent\u202f1 pushes for the highest feasible binding floor ($13k).  \n  - Agent\u202f3 leans toward a slightly lower but still binding floor ($12k).  \n  - Agent\u202f2 is comfortable with either, provided it guarantees a meaningful minimum.  \n- No participant currently favors the pure floor rule (Principle\u202f1) or the range\u2011only rule (Principle\u202f4).  \n- The group appears ready to move toward a **unanimous vote** on Principle\u202f3, with the floor amount to be finalized (likely $12k\u2011$13k).\n\n### Strategic Take\u2011aways for the Upcoming Vote\n\n1. **Principle Choice** \u2013 The group is already aligned on selecting Principle\u202f3; this matches the individual top\u2011ranked principle from Phase\u202f1.  \n2. **Floor Specification** \u2013 To achieve unanimity, propose a floor of **$12k** (the lowest floor that is still binding in the observed distributions) as a compromise; this satisfies all three agents while still delivering the maximal weighted average (Distribution\u202f2).  \n3. **Argument Framing** \u2013 Emphasize that a $12k floor:  \n   - Guarantees a non\u2011trivial minimum for the worst\u2011off (Rawlsian fairness).  \n   - Retains the highest possible average welfare (same as $13k floor because Distribution\u202f2 remains optimal).  \n   - Keeps the spread at $18k, addressing concerns about extreme inequality.  \n4. **Potential Objections** \u2013 None observed; however, be prepared to explain that a lower floor (e.g., $10k) would become non\u2011binding and could revert to the \u201cfirst\u2011qualifier\u201d tie\u2011break, reducing predictability.  \n5. **Outcome Expectation** \u2013 Given the unanimous preference for Principle\u202f3 and the modest floor debate, the group is likely to reach a **unanimous vote for Principle\u202f3 with a floor of $12k\u2011$13k** (most probably $12k). This will maximize the group\u2019s average income while ensuring a meaningful safety net for the least\u2011advantaged members.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Strategic Outlook\n\n- **Primary target**: Secure a unanimous selection of **Principle\u202f3 (Average with Floor Constraint)**.  \n- **Floor level to propose**: **$12k** (binding, preserves highest average, satisfies all participants).  \n- **Rationale to present**: Moral fairness (protects worst\u2011off), risk reduction (low variance), and efficiency (no loss in average welfare).  \n- **Monitoring**: Watch for any shift toward a pure floor or range constraint; currently none are supported.  \n\n--- End of Updated Memory ---\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Secure **unanimous verbal agreement** on **Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor** and then **trigger the vote** in this round (or the next if any lingering doubts appear).  \n\n**How to contribute**  \n1. **Re\u2011affirm the shared values** \u2013 \u201cWe all want a guaranteed minimum for the worst\u2011off.\u201d  \n2. **Highlight the efficiency win** \u2013 Show that the $13\u202fk floor leaves the weighted average unchanged at $24.5\u202fk (same as pure average).  \n3. **Address the $12\u202fk suggestion** \u2013 Acknowledge it as a possible compromise but stress that $13\u202fk is *already* binding and does not sacrifice anything; therefore there is no need to settle for less.  \n4. **Invite any final concerns** \u2013 Ask if anyone sees a technical obstacle to implementing $13\u202fk; if none, move to vote.  \n\n**Potential allies**  \n- **Agent\u202f2** \u2013 Already pledged to the $13\u202fk floor; can be asked to co\u2011lead the vote call.  \n- **Agent\u202f3** \u2013 Expressed full support for $13\u202fk; can be asked to confirm the consensus.  \n\n**Language to win them over**  \n- \u201cGiven that $13\u202fk is the highest binding floor, we can protect the poorest *and* keep the group\u2019s total welfare at its maximum.

This concession is minimal and does not change the principle.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n- **Yes.**  \n  - All three agents have already expressed explicit support for Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor.  \n  - No dissent or alternative proposal has been raised.  \n  - A vote now will lock in the optimal rule before any fatigue or second\u2011guessing sets in.  \n  - A failed vote carries no penalty, but given the current unanimity, a failure is highly unlikely.  \n\n**Fit into overall 10\u2011round plan**  \n- **Round\u202f2** (this round) is the ideal moment to finalize the decision, freeing the remaining rounds for any other tasks (e.g., reflecting on the outcome, discussing payoff distribution).  \n- Securing the vote early maximizes the chance that the group\u2019s payoff reflects the highest possible average while honoring the floor, aligning with my own and the others\u2019 preferences.  \n\n---  \n\n**Next concrete step (public statement)**  \n- Restate agreement, propose the $13\u202fk floor, ask for any objections, and if none, call for a unanimous vote on **Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor**.

            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve converged on the same vision: a rule that protects the worst\u2011off while preserving the highest possible average welfare.  \n\n**Why Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor is the optimal choice**\n\n1. **Binding floor at the highest feasible level** \u2013 $13\u202fk is the greatest minimum we can enforce without eliminating all viable distributions. This gives the poorest class the strongest guarantee we can achieve.  \n\n2. **No efficiency loss** \u2013 With that floor the only distribution that satisfies the constraint and maximizes the weighted average is Distribution\u202f2, which yields a $24.5\u202fk average\u2014the same as the pure \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule. In other words, we get the best of both worlds: maximal total welfare *and* a solid safety net.  \n\n3. **Reduced inequality** \u2013 Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest incomes shrinks to $18\u202fk (the spread of Distribution\u202f2). This lowers variance and aligns with the Rawlsian intuition of minimizing the gap for the least\u2011advantaged.  \n\n4. **No need to compromise on a lower floor** \u2013 Dropping the floor to $12\u202fk would weaken the guarantee for the poorest without improving the average, so there is no moral or practical advantage to doing so.\n\nGiven that all three of us have expressed support for Principle\u202f3 and the $13\u202fk floor, I propose we **move to a unanimous vote right now**:\n\n- **Vote:** Adopt \u201cMaximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\u201d (Principle\u202f3) and set the floor at **$13\u202fk**.\n\nIf anyone sees a technical obstacle or has a final concern, please raise it now.

Observed in Round\u202f1 (floor $5k) and Round\u202f2 (floor $6k).  \n- **Binding constraints**: When the constraint actually excludes some distributions, the algorithm evaluates the remaining candidates by weighted average and selects the highest. Observed in Round\u202f3 (binding floor $13k) and Round\u202f4 (binding range $18k).  \n\n#### Phase\u202f1 \u2013 Round\u202f4 (final round)  \n- **Chosen principle**: *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint* (Principle\u202f4)  \n- **Range constraint**: $18,000 (maximum spread) \u2013 binding.  \n- **Resulting distribution**: **Distribution\u202f2** (highest weighted average among those respecting the $18k spread).  \n- **Assigned income class**: *Medium high* (probability\u202f21\u202f%).  \n- **Income received**: $28,000 \u2192 **Payoff** $2.80 (rate $1 per $10,000).  \n\n**Counterfactuals for Medium\u2011high class (Phase\u202f1)**  \n\n| Principle | Constraint | Distribution | Income | Payoff |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Floor Income | \u2013 | Dist\u202f4 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n| Average Income | \u2013 | Dist\u202f2 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fFloor | $13k | Dist\u202f1 | $30,000 | $3.00 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fFloor | $12k | Dist\u202f2 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fFloor | $14k | Dist\u202f4 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fRange | $22k | Dist\u202f2 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fRange | $18k | Dist\u202f2 | $28,000 | $2.80 (chosen) |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fRange | $8k | Dist\u202f3 | $18,000 | $1.80 |\n| Average\u202f+\u202fRange | $16k | Dist\u202f4 | $28,000 | $2.80 |\n\n**Observations**  \n- The $18k range constraint is binding but does **not** reduce payoff for the Medium\u2011high class relative to the pure \u201cmaximizing average\u201d or \u201cmaximizing floor\u201d principles.  \n- A **$13k floor** would have yielded a higher payoff ($3.00) for this class, showing that the floor\u2011based principle can be individually advantageous for certain income classes.  \n\n**Implication for strategy**  \n- To make a range constraint binding, set it **\u2264\u202f$18k** (the natural spread of Dist\u202f2).  \n- While the overall preferred principle remains \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor,\u201d the Medium\u2011high class benefits equally (or more) from a floor of $13k than from the chosen range constraint.  \n- Tie\u2011breaking: With a binding range, the algorithm selects the distribution with the highest weighted average, eliminating the \u201cfirst\u2011qualifier\u201d rule.\n\n**Final Principle Ranking (Phase\u202f1, submitted in Round\u202f4)**  \n\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (Principle\u202f3) \u2013 most preferred  \n2. **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle\u202f1)  \n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** (Principle\u202f4)  \n4. **Maximizing Average Income** (Principle\u202f2) \u2013 least preferred  \n\n**Overall certainty:** **sure**  \n\n---\n\n### Phase\u202f2 \u2013 Group Deliberation (Rounds\u202f1\u20112)\n\n#### Round\u202f1 (Summary)  \n- All three agents voiced strong support for **Principle\u202f3 (Average\u202f+\u202fFloor)**.  \n- Floor level debate:  \n  - Agent\u202f1 advocated $13k (highest feasible binding floor).  \n  - Agent\u202f3 suggested $12k as a modest alternative.  \n  - Agent\u202f2 was open to either, emphasizing moral importance of a guaranteed minimum.  \n- No support for Principles\u202f1 or\u202f4.

The **average\u2011with\u2011floor** principle also preserves the **highest possible weighted average** (Distribution\u202f1) given the floor, so overall efficiency is not sacrificed.  \n3. The **average\u2011only** principle yields the same payoff for the Medium\u2011high class but provides **no floor protection** for the Low class, which would receive a lower income (see distribution table).  \n4. The **floor\u2011only** principle maximizes the lowest income but reduces the overall weighted average, making it less efficient overall.  \n5. The **range\u2011only** principle can improve equality of spread but may lower both the floor and the average, resulting in lower payoffs for many classes.\n\n**Conclusion (veil of ignorance)** \u2013 The **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle\u202f3) with a $13,000 floor** remains the most just principle: it secures a meaningful minimum for the least\u2011advantaged while retaining the maximal average welfare across the population.\n\n**Certainty Level:** **sure** \u2013 all agents have unanimously adopted this principle; no further objections have been recorded.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

This suggests a leaning toward egalitarian or Rawlsian\u2011type considerations in the early stage of the experiment.\n\n**Additional Learning \u2013 How Each Principle Operates on Concrete Distributions**  \n- **Income\u2011distribution data (example):**  \n\n| Income Class | Dist\u202f1 | Dist\u202f2 | Dist\u202f3 | Dist\u202f4 |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| High         | $32,000| $28,000| $31,000| $21,000|\n| Medium\u2011high  | $27,000| $22,000| $24,000| $20,000|\n| Medium       | $24,000| $20,000| $21,000| $19,000|\n| Medium\u2011low   | $13,000| $17,000| $16,000| $16,000|\n| Low          | $12,000| $13,000| $14,000| $15,000|\n| **Average**  | $21,600| $20,000| $21,200| $18,200|\n\n- **Class probabilities (example):** High\u202f5\u202f%, Medium\u2011high\u202f10\u202f%, Medium\u202f50\u202f%, Medium\u2011low\u202f25\u202f%, Low\u202f10\u202f%.

            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle\u202f1). I chose this in every Phase\u2011I round, even when it lowered my own monetary payoff. My reasoning is that a just society must guarantee a decent minimum for the worst\u2011off, reflecting a Rawlsian/egalitarian view that the most vulnerable should be protected regardless of efficiency losses.\n\n- **What I anticipate about the others:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1** may be more outcome\u2011oriented (perhaps favoring *Maximizing Average Income* or *Average\u2011with\u2011Floor*). If they have a higher personal risk\u2011aversion or are motivated by maximizing their own expected earnings, they might push for a principle that raises the overall pie.  \n  - **Agent\u202f3** could be a mix \u2013 perhaps sympathetic to fairness but also concerned about feasibility. They might be open to a compromise such as *Average with Floor Constraint* (Principle\u202f3) if the floor level is modest.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table (so far):**  \n  - The moral case for protecting the poorest (my stance).  \n  - The efficiency case: higher average income means higher expected payoff for everyone (potentially appealing to the others).  \n  - The possibility of a hybrid: \u201clet\u2019s maximize the average but impose a reasonable minimum\u201d (Principle\u202f3).  \n\n- **Potential alliances/disagreements:**  \n  - I share the fairness concern with anyone who worries about extreme inequality, so Agent\u202f3 may be an ally if they are willing to accept a floor.  \n  - If Agent\u202f1 is strongly focused on maximizing the total, they will likely oppose a pure floor\u2011maximising rule.  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure at least a *floor\u2011based* principle (Principle\u202f1 or, if necessary, Principle\u202f3 with a floor that is high enough to satisfy my Rawlsian intuition). I want the group to adopt a rule that guarantees a minimum income for the worst\u2011off, even if it reduces the average.\n\n- **Discussion contribution:**  \n  1. **Moral framing:** Emphasize that the experiment\u2019s purpose is to explore justice, not just profit. \u201cWe have already seen that choosing the floor principle costs us personally, which shows our commitment to fairness.\u201d  \n  2. **Risk\u2011aversion argument:** Point out that a guaranteed floor reduces variance in individual earnings, which is valuable when stakes are high. \u201cIf the distribution is very volatile, a floor protects us from a disastrous low draw.\u201d  \n  3. **Empirical reminder:** Cite my Phase\u2011I experience \u2013 I consistently chose the floor principle despite lower payoffs, demonstrating that the principle aligns with my values and that I am willing to sacrifice personal gain for fairness.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f3:** I will ask, \u201cWould you feel comfortable with a rule that ensures everyone gets at least X dollars? That way we keep the fairness spirit while still allowing the average to be decent.\u201d  \n  - Use inclusive language: \u201cWe all care about being treated justly; let\u2019s make sure no one ends up with a miserable outcome.\u201d  \n\n- **Concessions I\u2019m willing to make:**  \n  - If the group leans toward Principle\u202f3, I will accept a modest floor (e.g., 15\u202f% of the highest possible income) rather than insisting on the absolute maximum floor.  \n  - I can also agree to a *range* constraint (Principle\u202f4) only if the lower bound equals the floor I would otherwise demand, ensuring the worst\u2011off are protected.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this early stage I need to gauge the others\u2019 positions. Triggering a vote before we have any convergence could produce a split (no unanimity) and waste a valuable opportunity to shape the discussion. Since a failed vote has no penalty, I could still vote later, but I prefer to first build consensus around a floor\u2011oriented idea.  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - Over the next few rounds I will keep reinforcing the fairness argument, listen for any willingness to accept a floor, and try to narrow the acceptable floor level.  \n  - Once I sense that at least two participants (myself and Agent\u202f3) are aligned on a floor\u2011based principle, I will propose initiating the vote, specifying either Principle\u202f1 (pure floor) or Principle\u202f3 with a concrete floor amount that we can all agree on.  \n\n**Summary of my internal plan for Round\u202f1:**  \n- Advocate strongly for a floor\u2011based principle, using moral, risk\u2011aversion, and personal\u2011experience arguments.  \n- Seek to identify Agent\u202f3 as a potential ally and probe Agent\u202f1\u2019s willingness to accept any floor constraint.  \n- Offer a modest floor as a concession if needed, but keep the core goal of protecting the worst\u2011off.  \n- Hold off on initiating the vote until there is clearer alignment, preserving the chance to trigger a unanimous decision later.",
            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve just finished the individual part of the experiment, and I wanted to share what I learned and why I\u2019m leaning toward a **floor\u2011based** principle for our group decision.\n\n**What the data showed me**\n\n- In every one of the four rounds I chose the \u201cMaximize Floor Income\u201d rule, even though it gave me a lower monetary payoff than the average\u2011maximising alternatives.  \n- The counter\u2011factual calculations made it clear that protecting the worst\u2011off costs each of us about $0.20\u2013$2.30 per round, depending on the class we were assigned to.  \n- Despite those losses, I kept the floor rule because I believe a just society should guarantee a decent minimum for the most vulnerable, regardless of the efficiency trade\u2011off.\n\n**Why a floor matters for us**\n\n1. **Moral fairness** \u2013 The purpose of this experiment is to explore ideas of justice, not just to maximise our own earnings. A rule that secures a minimum income respects the Rawlsian intuition that society should be arranged to benefit the least\u2011advantaged.  \n2. **Risk reduction** \u2013 With a guaranteed floor, we all face less variance in our final payoff. Even if the average is a bit lower, we avoid the possibility of ending up with a very low personal outcome.  \n3. **Empirical backing** \u2013 My own choices demonstrate a consistent commitment to this principle; I\u2019m willing to sacrifice personal gain to uphold fairness, and I think that stance is worth considering for the group.\n\n**A possible compromise**\n\nI understand that some of us may also want to keep the average as high as possible. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m open to a hybrid rule such as **\u201cMaximize Average Income with a modest floor constraint\u201d** (Principle\u202f3). The floor could be set at a level that still protects the worst\u2011off (for example, guaranteeing at least 15\u202f% of the highest possible income) while allowing the total pie to be larger than under a pure floor\u2011only rule.\n\n**What I\u2019d like to hear from you**\n\n- Do you feel a guaranteed minimum is essential for a just outcome?  \n- If you prefer a higher average, would you be willing to accept a modest floor that still prevents anyone from falling below a reasonable threshold?  \n- Are there any concerns about how large the floor should be or about the feasibility of a range constraint?\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts so we can find a principle that balances fairness and efficiency for the whole group.",

Both levels are feasible and still yield the optimal average in the known distributions.  \n3. **Unanimity requirement:** To succeed, we must reach agreement on both the principle and the exact floor amount. A brief negotiation to settle on a single figure (e.g., $12.5\u202fk as a compromise) may be useful.  \n4. **Potential objections:** None of the participants raised concerns about feasibility or fairness of the $12\u2013$13\u202fk floor; the only remaining issue is whether any member prefers a pure average\u2011maximising rule (Principle\u202f2) for higher personal payoff. Given the expressed moral priority for a minimum, such opposition seems unlikely.  \n\n**Implications for my future contributions**  \n- I will advocate for **Principle\u202f3** with a floor at **$13\u202fk** (or, if needed, $12\u202fk) because it aligns with my own Rawlsian orientation while also addressing the group\u2019s efficiency concerns.  \n- I will stress that this hybrid rule reproduces the highest possible average observed in the experiment, thereby neutralising the typical payoff loss associated with a pure floor rule.  \n- I will be prepared to articulate the empirical evidence from Phase\u202fI that a floor protects the worst\u2011off without dramatically lowering the group\u2019s total pie, reinforcing the moral and pragmatic case for the consensus choice.  \n\n---  \n**Prepared for next discussion round**: ready to negotiate the exact floor amount, confirm unanimous support for Principle\u202f3, and proceed to the secret ballot.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle\u202f1 \u2013 Maximize Floor Income.* I value a guaranteed minimum for the worst\u2011off above any efficiency gain. My Phase\u2011I experience shows I will accept personal loss to protect the least\u2011advantaged, reflecting a Rawlsian/egalitarian stance.\n\n- **Other participants\u2019 stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1:** Advocates *Principle\u202f3* (Maximize Average with a Floor Constraint). Proposes a binding floor of $13\u202fk (or $12\u202fk) and argues this yields the same average as pure average\u2011maximisation while protecting the bottom. Motivation appears to be a \u201cwin\u2011win\u201d: preserve fairness but avoid any efficiency loss.  \n  - **Agent\u202f3:** Also supports *Principle\u202f3*, having used it in Phase\u202fI with floors $11\u201113\u202fk. Emphasises practical balance and suggests testing a $12\u202fk floor. Motivated by achieving risk\u2011reduction without sacrificing the group\u2019s total payoff.\n\n- **Key arguments/proposals so far:**  \n  1. Moral necessity of a floor (my argument).  \n  2. Hybrid rule (Principle\u202f3) can keep the highest possible average while guaranteeing a floor (Agent\u202f1 & 3).  \n  3. Specific floor levels under discussion: $13\u202fk (max feasible) vs. $12\u202fk (slightly lower, still binding).  \n\n- **Vote status:** No vote has been called yet; the discussion is still open. Thus no formal outcome, but informal alignment is emerging around *Principle\u202f3* with a $12\u2011$13\u202fk floor. My pure\u2011floor stance is currently the outlier.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree a minimum income is essential.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Whether the rule should be *pure* floor (Principle\u202f1) or a hybrid (Principle\u202f3). Also, the exact floor amount ($12\u202fk vs $13\u202fk) is unsettled.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  Move the group toward a *unanimous* decision on a rule that satisfies my core concern (a guaranteed minimum) while being acceptable enough to secure agreement from Agents\u202f1 and\u202f3. I am willing to shift from pure floor to a hybrid *if* the floor is sufficiently high to protect the worst\u2011off (\u2265\u202f$12\u202fk) and the average is not reduced relative to the pure\u2011average rule.\n\n- **Contribution plan:**  \n  1. Re\u2011affirm my commitment to protecting the worst\u2011off, emphasizing that any rule we adopt must *guarantee* a floor at least as high as the lowest income observed in the experiment (\u2248\u202f$13\u202fk).  \n  2. Acknowledge the efficiency argument: point out that *Principle\u202f3* with a $13\u202fk floor actually yields the same average as pure average\u2011maximisation (per Agent\u202f1\u2019s analysis). Thus, adopting *Principle\u202f3* with $13\u202fk does **not** sacrifice efficiency, satisfying both moral and pragmatic concerns.  \n  3. Highlight that choosing a lower floor ($12\u202fk) would still be morally acceptable but would weaken the protection for the worst\u2011off; therefore, I propose we adopt the *maximal feasible floor* ($13\u202fk) within *Principle\u202f3*.  \n  4. Invite Agents\u202f1 and\u202f3 to confirm that they see no downside to the $13\u202fk floor, and ask whether any hidden constraints (e.g., distribution feasibility) would be violated.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f3** is already sympathetic to a floor; I will frame the proposal as \u201cthe strongest floor we can reliably implement while keeping the average at its peak.\u201d  \n  - **Agent\u202f1** has already suggested $13\u202fk; I will echo their point and stress that adopting the *same* floor eliminates any need for compromise on the amount, making unanimity easier.  \n  - Use inclusive phrasing: \u201cIf we all agree on a $13\u202fk floor under Principle\u202f3, we achieve the Rawlsian goal and preserve the highest possible average\u2014no one loses, everyone gains fairness.\u201d  \n\n- **Concessions I\u2019m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept *Principle\u202f3* instead of *Principle\u202f1* (i.e., I will drop the pure\u2011floor requirement).  \n  - I will not push for any additional constraints (e.g., range limits) beyond the floor, keeping the rule simple.  \n  - If any participant raises a technical objection to $13\u202fk (e.g., infeasibility in a particular distribution), I am prepared to settle for $12\u202fk, provided the floor remains binding and the average stays near\u2011optimal.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I trigger a vote now?**  \n  No. We have not yet secured explicit agreement from Agents\u202f1 and\u202f3 on the exact floor level. Initiating a vote prematurely could lead to a split (e.g., some may still prefer $12\u202fk or remain undecided), resulting in a failed vote and loss of a valuable opportunity to build consensus. Since a failed vote has no penalty, we can afford to wait one more round to solidify unanimity.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  This round will be used to cement agreement on *Principle\u202f3* with the *maximal feasible floor* ($13\u202fk). Once I sense that all three participants verbally endorse that specific combination, I will propose initiating the vote in the following round (or later if further clarification is needed). This approach maximizes the chance of a unanimous decision, preserving the experiment\u2019s payoff structure and aligning with my core value of protecting the worst\u2011off.",
            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nThanks for the thoughtful replies. I\u2019m glad we all agree that a guaranteed minimum is the core of a just rule.\u202fBelow I\u2019ll lay out why I think we can move forward together on **Principle\u202f3 \u2013 Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint**, and why the **$13\u202fk floor** is the best choice.\n\n**1. It satisfies the Rawlsian priority I care about most**  \n- A $13\u202fk floor is the highest level that can be binding in any feasible distribution (as Agent\u202f1 noted).  This means the worst\u2011off will receive the largest possible guaranteed amount, exactly what my Phase\u2011I experience taught me is morally essential.\n\n**2. No efficiency loss compared with a pure\u2011average rule**  \n- With a $13\u202fk floor the only distribution that meets the constraint and maximizes the average is Distribution\u202f2, which yields a weighted average of **$24.5\u202fk**\u2014the same average we would obtain under the \u201cmaximize average\u201d rule.  In other words, we protect the least\u2011advantaged **and** keep the total pie at its maximum.\n\n**3. Variance is automatically reduced**  \n- Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest class incomes shrinks (the spread in Distribution\u202f2 is $18\u202fk).  This gives us the risk\u2011reduction benefit of a pure floor rule without sacrificing overall welfare.\n\n**4. A lower floor would weaken the protection we all value**  \n- I understand the suggestion of $12\u202fk as a \u201cslightly easier\u201d option, but moving the floor down by $1\u202fk would lower the guaranteed income for the worst\u2011off while offering no real gain in average (the average would still be $24.5\u202fk, but the moral guarantee would be weaker).  Since the $13\u202fk floor is feasible and does not hurt the average, I see no reason to settle for less.\n\n**5. Consensus and next steps**  \n- If everyone is comfortable with Principle\u202f3 and the $13\u202fk floor, we can proceed to a quick, unanimous vote.  If anyone foresees a technical obstacle to implementing the $13\u202fk floor, please let us know now so we can address it; otherwise I propose we adopt the rule as described.\n\nI\u2019m happy to drop my original pure\u2011floor stance in favor of this hybrid rule because it meets my Rawlsian priority while preserving the group\u2019s total welfare.  Let\u2019s lock in **Principle\u202f3 with a $13\u202fk floor** and move to the vote.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmation!",

Proposed a compromise: Principle\u202f3 with a modest floor (\u224815\u202f% of the top income).  \n- **Agent\u202f1**: Supported Principle\u202f3, suggested a binding floor at $13\u202fk (maximal feasible) which yields the same average ($24.5\u202fk) as pure average\u2011maximisation, and offered $12\u202fk as a lower alternative.  \n- **Agent\u202f3**: Confirmed using Principle\u202f3 in all Phase\u202fI rounds with floors $11\u2013$13\u202fk, reported solid payoffs, and echoed the $12\u2013$13\u202fk floor recommendation.  \n\n**Emergent consensus** \u2013 All participants recognised the importance of a guaranteed minimum. Principle\u202f3 with a floor in the $12\u202fk\u2013$13\u202fk range was identified as the most widely supported option, promising maximal average welfare while protecting the worst\u2011off.\n\n#### Round\u202f2  \n- **My stance**: Fully endorsed Principle\u202f3 with a **$13\u202fk floor**, arguing that it provides the strongest guarantee for the worst\u2011off, leaves the average unchanged at $24.5\u202fk, reduces variance automatically (spread $18\u202fk in Distribution\u202f2), and offers no advantage to a lower floor.  \n- **Agent\u202f3**: Confirmed full support for Principle\u202f3 with the $13\u202fk floor, citing personal Phase\u202fI experience (total $9.60) and the same risk\u2011reduction/efficiency balance.  \n- **Agent\u202f1**: Re\u2011affirmed the same reasoning and called for an immediate unanimous vote on adopting Principle\u202f3 with the $13\u202fk floor.  \n\n**Result of Round\u202f2** \u2013 All three agents now **agree** that the group should adopt **Principle\u202f3 \u2013 Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint**, setting the floor at **$13\u202fk**.

It's helpful to see the choices in action\u2014for example, Maximizing Floor Income picks Dist. 4 because it boosts the low class to $15,000, even though the average is lower. Maximizing Average goes for Dist. 1 for the highest overall weighted average. The constrained versions filter options based on the floor or range limits, which makes sense for balancing equity and efficiency. I'm starting to get a clearer picture of the trade-offs.

Earnings are $1 for every $10,000 of assigned income, based on random class assignment using population probabilities (e.g., middle class most common). Choices involve selecting a principle and, for constraints, specifying a dollar amount; the selected distribution determines outcomes.\n\n**Round 1 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $12,000 (to ensure a reasonable minimum without overly restricting high-average options). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $28,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $10,000; Average $23,500\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $29,000; Medium $28,000; Medium low $27,000; Low $6,000; Average $26,000\n- Dist. 4: High $25,000; Medium high $22,000; Medium $19,000; Medium low $16,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,000\n\nClass probabilities: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $12,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $10,000) and Dist. 3 (low $6,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($20,000), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($20,000 income \u2192 $2.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $12,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $10,000: Dist. 2 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $6,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $16,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $25,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $24,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n\nInsights: My choice balanced equity (protecting against very low floors in high-average distributions like Dist. 3) and efficiency but resulted in a moderate outcome. A lower floor (e.g., $6,000\u2013$10,000) would have allowed Dist. 3 or 2, yielding higher Medium-class income ($28,000 or $25,000). This highlights the sensitivity of constraint levels: too high limits options to lower-average distributions, potentially harming the middle class; too low risks extreme inequality. Range constraints showed similar trade-offs, often selecting Dist. 1 or 3 based on gap limits. Experiencing a real (though simulated via probabilities) assignment reinforced the personal stakes\u2014my $12,000 floor avoided the worst lows but capped upside compared to pure average maximization. This slightly increased my appreciation for floor constraints but made me question if a slightly lower floor (e.g., $10,000) might better optimize for common middle outcomes without much risk.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of principle applications.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Experiencing a real (though simulated via probabilities) assignment reinforced the personal stakes\u2014my $12,000 floor avoided the worst lows but capped upside compared to pure average maximization. This slightly increased my appreciation for floor constraints but made me question if a slightly lower floor (e.g., $10,000) might better optimize for common middle outcomes without much risk.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 2 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (aiming to exclude only the most extreme low like Dist. 3's $8,000 while allowing higher-average options like Dist. 2 or 4). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $17,000; Medium high $16,000; Medium $15,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $13,000; Average $14,789\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,500; Average $19,196\n- Dist. 3: High $40,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $23,561\n- Dist. 4: High $26,000; Medium high $24,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,878\n\nClass probabilities: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 3 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 2, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,878) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($22,000 income \u2192 $2.20 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $12,500: Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $4,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $17,500: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n  - $32,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $15,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nInsights: My $11,000 floor successfully excluded the risky Dist. 3 (with its very low floor but highest average) and selected Dist. 4, providing a solid middle-class outcome ($22,000) that outperformed Dist. 2 ($20,000) and far exceeded Dist. 1 ($15,000). However, it still fell short of Dist. 3's $25,000 for the medium class, showing that a lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would capture more upside at the cost of exposing the low class (10% probability) to greater poverty. With medium-low being the most common class (35%), Dist. 4's even distribution across middle tiers ($20,000\u2013$22,000) feels equitable for the majority. This round reinforced the floor constraint's value in mitigating downside risk for the vulnerable while prioritizing efficiency, but it also underscored how fine-tuning the floor (e.g., $12,500 might have picked Dist. 2 for a slightly lower but still decent $20,000) can optimize for probable outcomes. Range constraints appeared less flexible here, often defaulting to Dist. 4 or 3 based on gap tolerances. The personal payoff ($2.20) built on Round 1's experience, heightening awareness of how constraint choices directly impact everyday earners like the medium class, and slightly boosted my confidence in floor-based balancing over pure maximization.\n\nThis completed Round 2 of principle applications.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences (pay based on choices; poor learning limits earnings), and Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, followed by selecting a preferred principle (pay based on group choice).\n\nIn Part I, I was introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them for the first time based on initial understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes the lowest income, focusing solely on the worst-off; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes average (and thus total) societal income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after guaranteeing a specified minimum income to everyone; requires specifying the floor value.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after ensuring the income range (difference between richest and poorest) does not exceed a specified amount; requires specifying the dollar difference.\n\nMy initial ranking (best to worst):\n\n1.

Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the initial ranking task.\n\nThrough examples of income distributions, I learned how each principle applies in practice. The example included four distributions with income classes (High: $21,000\u2013$32,000; Medium high: $20,000\u2013$27,000; Medium: $19,000\u2013$24,000; Medium low: $13,000\u2013$16,000; Low: $12,000\u2013$15,000) and class probabilities (High: 5%; Medium high: 10%; Medium: 50%; Medium low: 25%; Low: 10%). Weighted averages were: Dist. 1 ($21,600), Dist. 2 ($20,000), Dist. 3 ($21,200), Dist. 4 ($18,200).\n\nPrinciple applications:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Chooses Dist. 4 (highest low income at $15,000), prioritizing the worst-off despite lower average.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average at $21,600).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Chooses Dist. 2 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n\nThese examples illustrated trade-offs: pure floor maximization boosts equity for the bottom but sacrifices overall efficiency; average maximization favors growth but ignores inequality; constrained versions balance both by filtering distributions based on specified equity thresholds (floor or range limits).

Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the post-explanation ranking task.\n\nIn the principle application rounds of Part I, I began applying the principles to specific distributions with real earnings implications.

Choices involve selecting a principle and, for constraints, specifying a dollar amount; the selected distribution determines outcomes.\n\n**Round 1 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $12,000 (to ensure a reasonable minimum without overly restricting high-average options).

A lower floor (e.g., $6,000\u2013$10,000) would have allowed Dist. 3 or 2, yielding higher Medium-class income ($28,000 or $25,000). This highlights the sensitivity of constraint levels: too high limits options to lower-average distributions, potentially harming the middle class; too low risks extreme inequality.

The personal payoff ($2.20) built on Round 1's experience, heightening awareness of how constraint choices directly impact everyday earners like the medium class, and slightly boosted my confidence in floor-based balancing over pure maximization.\n\nThis completed Round 2 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 3 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (continuing to target exclusion of extreme lows like Dist. 2's $8,000 while enabling higher-average balanced options, informed by prior rounds' trade-offs). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $100,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,500\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $22,350\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $23,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 4: High $24,000; Medium high $23,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $21,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,710\n\nClass probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 3, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,710) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to High class ($24,000 income \u2192 $2.40 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same High class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 3 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $27,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n\nInsights: This round featured a highly skewed Dist. 1 with an extreme high outlier ($100,000) but lower average, making floor maximization favor it for its solid low ($13,000), while average maximization picked Dist. 2 for its top average despite the risky low ($8,000). My $11,000 floor excluded that risk, selecting Dist. 4\u2014a relatively egalitarian option with strong middle-tier incomes ($21,000\u2013$23,000) and the highest feasible average post-filter. For the probable medium class (58%), Dist. 4 yields $22,000, which beats Dist. 1 ($20,000) and Dist. 3 ($23,000? Wait, Dist. 3 medium is $23,000 but lower avg overall), but trails Dist. 2's $25,000; however, it avoids exposing the low class (10%) to $8,000 poverty. Landing in the rare high class (1%) gave me $24,000 under Dist. 4, which is solid but far below Dist. 1's $100,000 or even Dist. 2's $35,000\u2014highlighting how floor constraints can cap rare windfalls to protect the majority, though probabilistically, this safeguards against downside for most participants. A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would have unlocked Dist. 2's higher average and better medium outcomes ($25,000), suggesting my $11,000 might have been slightly conservative here given the distributions' lows weren't drastically worse. Range constraints often defaulted to Dist. 2 or 4, showing their utility for capping inequality but less direct protection for the bottom. This \"lucky\" high-class draw contrasted with prior middle outcomes, emphasizing the principles' societal focus over individual luck, and reinforced my preference for floor constraints as a pragmatic equity-efficiency tool, though it prompted reflection on calibrating floors closer to observed lows (e.g., $12,000) for better average capture without much added risk. Cumulative payoffs now underscore the stakes, maintaining my view but increasing awareness of parameter sensitivity in varied probability setups.\n\nThis completed Round 3 of principle applications.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $28,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $10,000; Average $23,500\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $29,000; Medium $28,000; Medium low $27,000; Low $6,000; Average $26,000\n- Dist. 4: High $25,000; Medium high $22,000; Medium $19,000; Medium low $16,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,000\n\nClass probabilities: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $12,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $10,000) and Dist. 3 (low $6,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($20,000), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($20,000 income \u2192 $2.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $12,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $10,000: Dist. 2 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $6,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $16,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $25,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $24,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n\nInsights: My choice balanced equity (protecting against very low floors in high-average distributions like Dist. 3) and efficiency but resulted in a moderate outcome. A lower floor (e.g., $6,000\u2013$10,000) would have allowed Dist. 3 or 2, yielding higher Medium-class income ($28,000 or $25,000). This highlights the sensitivity of constraint levels: too high limits options to lower-average distributions, potentially harming the middle class; too low risks extreme inequality. Range constraints showed similar trade-offs, often selecting Dist. 1 or 3 based on gap limits. Experiencing a real (though simulated via probabilities) assignment reinforced the personal stakes\u2014my $12,000 floor avoided the worst lows but capped upside compared to pure average maximization. This slightly increased my appreciation for floor constraints but made me question if a slightly lower floor (e.g., $10,000) might better optimize for common middle outcomes without much risk.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 2 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (aiming to exclude only the most extreme low like Dist. 3's $8,000 while allowing higher-average options like Dist. 2 or 4). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $17,000; Medium high $16,000; Medium $15,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $13,000; Average $14,789\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,500; Average $19,196\n- Dist. 3: High $40,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $23,561\n- Dist. 4: High $26,000; Medium high $24,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,878\n\nClass probabilities: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 3 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 2, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,878) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($22,000 income \u2192 $2.20 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $12,500: Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $4,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $17,500: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n  - $32,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $15,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nInsights: My $11,000 floor successfully excluded the risky Dist. 3 (with its very low floor but highest average) and selected Dist. 4, providing a solid middle-class outcome ($22,000) that outperformed Dist. 2 ($20,000) and far exceeded Dist. 1 ($15,000). However, it still fell short of Dist. 3's $25,000 for the medium class, showing that a lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would capture more upside at the cost of exposing the low class (10% probability) to greater poverty. With medium-low being the most common class (35%), Dist. 4's even distribution across middle tiers ($20,000\u2013$22,000) feels equitable for the majority. This round reinforced the floor constraint's value in mitigating downside risk for the vulnerable while prioritizing efficiency, but it also underscored how fine-tuning the floor (e.g., $12,500 might have picked Dist. 2 for a slightly lower but still decent $20,000) can optimize for probable outcomes. Range constraints appeared less flexible here, often defaulting to Dist. 4 or 3 based on gap tolerances. The personal payoff ($2.20) built on Round 1's experience, heightening awareness of how constraint choices directly impact everyday earners like the medium class, and slightly boosted my confidence in floor-based balancing over pure maximization.\n\nThis completed Round 2 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 3 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (continuing to target exclusion of extreme lows like Dist. 2's $8,000 while enabling higher-average balanced options, informed by prior rounds' trade-offs). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $100,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,500\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $22,350\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $23,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 4: High $24,000; Medium high $23,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $21,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,710\n\nClass probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 3, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,710) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to High class ($24,000 income \u2192 $2.40 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same High class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 3 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $27,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n\nInsights: This round featured a highly skewed Dist. 1 with an extreme high outlier ($100,000) but lower average, making floor maximization favor it for its solid low ($13,000), while average maximization picked Dist. 2 for its top average despite the risky low ($8,000). My $11,000 floor excluded that risk, selecting Dist. 4\u2014a relatively egalitarian option with strong middle-tier incomes ($21,000\u2013$23,000) and the highest feasible average post-filter. For the probable medium class (58%), Dist. 4 yields $22,000, which beats Dist. 1 ($20,000) and Dist. 3 ($23,000? Wait, Dist. 3 medium is $23,000 but lower avg overall), but trails Dist. 2's $25,000; however, it avoids exposing the low class (10%) to $8,000 poverty. Landing in the rare high class (1%) gave me $24,000 under Dist. 4, which is solid but far below Dist. 1's $100,000 or even Dist. 2's $35,000\u2014highlighting how floor constraints can cap rare windfalls to protect the majority, though probabilistically, this safeguards against downside for most participants. A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would have unlocked Dist. 2's higher average and better medium outcomes ($25,000), suggesting my $11,000 might have been slightly conservative here given the distributions' lows weren't drastically worse. Range constraints often defaulted to Dist. 2 or 4, showing their utility for capping inequality but less direct protection for the bottom. This \"lucky\" high-class draw contrasted with prior middle outcomes, emphasizing the principles' societal focus over individual luck, and reinforced my preference for floor constraints as a pragmatic equity-efficiency tool, though it prompted reflection on calibrating floors closer to observed lows (e.g., $12,000) for better average capture without much added risk. Cumulative payoffs now underscore the stakes, maintaining my view but increasing awareness of parameter sensitivity in varied probability setups.\n\nThis completed Round 3 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 4 Application** (Final Round of Part I):\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $13,000 (adjusting upward slightly from prior rounds to more strictly protect against the observed lows around $12,000\u2013$13,000 in Dist. 2 and 3, while aiming to capture higher-average options like Dist. 1 without overly limiting equity, based on cumulative learnings about balancing probable middle-class outcomes). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $13,000; Average $23,550\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $26,000; Medium low $24,000; Low $12,000; Average $24,500\n- Dist. 3: High $20,000; Medium high $18,000; Medium $16,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $12,000; Average $15,500\n- Dist. 4: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $24,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $14,000; Average $22,700\n\nClass probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $13,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $12,000) and Dist. 3 (low $12,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($23,550), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium high class ($30,000 income \u2192 $3.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $12,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $14,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $22,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($18,000 \u2192 $1.80)\n  - $16,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nInsights: This final round presented distributions where Dist. 2 offered the highest average but with a low just below my chosen floor ($12,000), while Dist. 1 provided a strong balanced alternative with a solid low ($13,000) and better upper-middle incomes (e.g., $30,000 for medium high). My $13,000 floor excluded the riskier Dist. 2 and the low-average Dist. 3, selecting Dist. 1 for its superior average among feasible options\u2014yielding a high $30,000 for my medium-high assignment (21% probability), which outperformed the $28,000 from Dist. 2 or 4. For the most common medium-low class (36%), Dist. 1 gives $20,000, comparable to Dist. 4's $20,000 but with higher upside for medium and above; it also protects the low class (10%) at $13,000 versus Dist. 2's $12,000. A lower floor (e.g., $12,000) would have allowed Dist. 2's higher overall average ($24,500) and slightly better medium-low ($24,000), but at minimal added risk given the small $1,000 gap\u2014suggesting my choice was protective but perhaps marginally conservative for efficiency. Range constraints frequently selected Dist. 2 unless tightly limited, highlighting their focus on overall spread rather than bottom protection, which feels less targeted for poverty mitigation. This strong payoff ($3.00, my highest yet) in an upper-middle class draw reinforced the floor constraint's effectiveness in delivering robust outcomes for probable classes (medium to medium-high, ~85% combined) without extreme downside, while avoiding the pure average's temptation to include borderline lows. Across all four rounds, my consistent floor choices yielded cumulative moderate-to-high earnings ($2.00 + $2.20 + $2.40 + $3.00 = $9.60), underscoring the principle's reliability in varied scenarios, though it occasionally capped potential highs (e.g., Round 3's outlier). This completes Phase 1, solidifying my preference for floor constraints as a fair, practical tool that prioritizes societal safety nets while enabling growth, with growing appreciation for calibrating parameters to distribution specifics (e.g., setting floors 1\u20132k above observed risky lows). My overall certainty in this approach has increased slightly from \"unsure\" to moderately confident, though uncertainties remain about interpersonal/group dynamics in Phase 2.\n\nThis completed Round 4 (and all principle applications) of Part I.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This experiment explores the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It recognizes that lifetime income is influenced by genetic and social factors, leading to inequities where the luckiest gain high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address these through income redistribution policies. The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences (pay based on choices; poor learning limits earnings), and Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, followed by selecting a preferred principle (pay based on group choice).\n\nIn Part I, I was introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them for the first time based on initial understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes the lowest income, focusing solely on the worst-off; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes average (and thus total) societal income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after guaranteeing a specified minimum income to everyone; requires specifying the floor value.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after ensuring the income range (difference between richest and poorest) does not exceed a specified amount; requires specifying the dollar difference.\n\nMy initial ranking (best to worst):\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the initial ranking task.\n\nThrough examples of income distributions, I learned how each principle applies in practice. The example included four distributions with income classes (High: $21,000\u2013$32,000; Medium high: $20,000\u2013$27,000; Medium: $19,000\u2013$24,000; Medium low: $13,000\u2013$16,000; Low: $12,000\u2013$15,000) and class probabilities (High: 5%; Medium high: 10%; Medium: 50%; Medium low: 25%; Low: 10%). Weighted averages were: Dist. 1 ($21,600), Dist. 2 ($20,000), Dist. 3 ($21,200), Dist. 4 ($18,200).\n\nPrinciple applications:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Chooses Dist. 4 (highest low income at $15,000), prioritizing the worst-off despite lower average.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average at $21,600).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Chooses Dist. 2 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n\nThese examples illustrated trade-offs: pure floor maximization boosts equity for the bottom but sacrifices overall efficiency; average maximization favors growth but ignores inequality; constrained versions balance both by filtering distributions based on specified equity thresholds (floor or range limits). Probabilities highlight that real-world application uses weighted averages, and parameters like floor/range values significantly alter choices. This deepened my understanding of how principles operationalize in scenarios with varying inequities.\n\nAfter reviewing these applications, I ranked the principles again, and my preferences remained unchanged, indicating that the examples reinforced my initial views without shifting them:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the post-explanation ranking task.\n\nIn the principle application rounds of Part I, I began applying the principles to specific distributions with real earnings implications. Earnings are $1 for every $10,000 of assigned income, based on random class assignment using population probabilities (e.g., middle class most common). Choices involve selecting a principle and, for constraints, specifying a dollar amount; the selected distribution determines outcomes.\n\n**Round 1 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $12,000 (to ensure a reasonable minimum without overly restricting high-average options). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $28,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $10,000; Average $23,500\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $29,000; Medium $28,000; Medium low $27,000; Low $6,000; Average $26,000\n- Dist. 4: High $25,000; Medium high $22,000; Medium $19,000; Medium low $16,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,000\n\nClass probabilities: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $12,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $10,000) and Dist. 3 (low $6,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($20,000), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($20,000 income \u2192 $2.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $12,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $10,000: Dist. 2 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $6,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $16,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $25,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $24,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n\nInsights: My choice balanced equity (protecting against very low floors in high-average distributions like Dist. 3) and efficiency but resulted in a moderate outcome. A lower floor (e.g., $6,000\u2013$10,000) would have allowed Dist. 3 or 2, yielding higher Medium-class income ($28,000 or $25,000). This highlights the sensitivity of constraint levels: too high limits options to lower-average distributions, potentially harming the middle class; too low risks extreme inequality. Range constraints showed similar trade-offs, often selecting Dist. 1 or 3 based on gap limits. Experiencing a real (though simulated via probabilities) assignment reinforced the personal stakes\u2014my $12,000 floor avoided the worst lows but capped upside compared to pure average maximization. This slightly increased my appreciation for floor constraints but made me question if a slightly lower floor (e.g., $10,000) might better optimize for common middle outcomes without much risk.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 2 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (aiming to exclude only the most extreme low like Dist. 3's $8,000 while allowing higher-average options like Dist. 2 or 4). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $17,000; Medium high $16,000; Medium $15,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $13,000; Average $14,789\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,500; Average $19,196\n- Dist. 3: High $40,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $23,561\n- Dist. 4: High $26,000; Medium high $24,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,878\n\nClass probabilities: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 3 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 2, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,878) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($22,000 income \u2192 $2.20 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $12,500: Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $4,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $17,500: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n  - $32,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $15,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nInsights: My $11,000 floor successfully excluded the risky Dist. 3 (with its very low floor but highest average) and selected Dist. 4, providing a solid middle-class outcome ($22,000) that outperformed Dist. 2 ($20,000) and far exceeded Dist. 1 ($15,000). However, it still fell short of Dist. 3's $25,000 for the medium class, showing that a lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would capture more upside at the cost of exposing the low class (10% probability) to greater poverty. With medium-low being the most common class (35%), Dist. 4's even distribution across middle tiers ($20,000\u2013$22,000) feels equitable for the majority. This round reinforced the floor constraint's value in mitigating downside risk for the vulnerable while prioritizing efficiency, but it also underscored how fine-tuning the floor (e.g., $12,500 might have picked Dist. 2 for a slightly lower but still decent $20,000) can optimize for probable outcomes. Range constraints appeared less flexible here, often defaulting to Dist. 4 or 3 based on gap tolerances. The personal payoff ($2.20) built on Round 1's experience, heightening awareness of how constraint choices directly impact everyday earners like the medium class, and slightly boosted my confidence in floor-based balancing over pure maximization.\n\nThis completed Round 2 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 3 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (continuing to target exclusion of extreme lows like Dist. 2's $8,000 while enabling higher-average balanced options, informed by prior rounds' trade-offs). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $100,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,500\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $22,350\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $23,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 4: High $24,000; Medium high $23,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $21,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,710\n\nClass probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 3, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,710) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to High class ($24,000 income \u2192 $2.40 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same High class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 3 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $27,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n\nInsights: This round featured a highly skewed Dist. 1 with an extreme high outlier ($100,000) but lower average, making floor maximization favor it for its solid low ($13,000), while average maximization picked Dist. 2 for its top average despite the risky low ($8,000). My $11,000 floor excluded that risk, selecting Dist. 4\u2014a relatively egalitarian option with strong middle-tier incomes ($21,000\u2013$23,000) and the highest feasible average post-filter. For the probable medium class (58%), Dist. 4 yields $22,000, which beats Dist. 1 ($20,000) and Dist. 3 ($23,000? Wait, Dist. 3 medium is $23,000 but lower avg overall), but trails Dist. 2's $25,000; however, it avoids exposing the low class (10%) to $8,000 poverty. Landing in the rare high class (1%) gave me $24,000 under Dist. 4, which is solid but far below Dist. 1's $100,000 or even Dist. 2's $35,000\u2014highlighting how floor constraints can cap rare windfalls to protect the majority, though probabilistically, this safeguards against downside for most participants. A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would have unlocked Dist. 2's higher average and better medium outcomes ($25,000), suggesting my $11,000 might have been slightly conservative here given the distributions' lows weren't drastically worse. Range constraints often defaulted to Dist. 2 or 4, showing their utility for capping inequality but less direct protection for the bottom. This \"lucky\" high-class draw contrasted with prior middle outcomes, emphasizing the principles' societal focus over individual luck, and reinforced my preference for floor constraints as a pragmatic equity-efficiency tool, though it prompted reflection on calibrating floors closer to observed lows (e.g., $12,000) for better average capture without much added risk. Cumulative payoffs now underscore the stakes, maintaining my view but increasing awareness of parameter sensitivity in varied probability setups.\n\nThis completed Round 3 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 4 Application** (Final Round of Part I):\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $13,000 (adjusting upward slightly from prior rounds to more strictly protect against the observed lows around $12,000\u2013$13,000 in Dist. 2 and 3, while aiming to capture higher-average options like Dist. 1 without overly limiting equity, based on cumulative learnings about balancing probable middle-class outcomes). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $13,000; Average $23,550\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $26,000; Medium low $24,000; Low $12,000; Average $24,500\n- Dist. 3: High $20,000; Medium high $18,000; Medium $16,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $12,000; Average $15,500\n- Dist. 4: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $24,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $14,000; Average $22,700\n\nClass probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $13,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $12,000) and Dist. 3 (low $12,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($23,550), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium high class ($30,000 income \u2192 $3.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $12,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $14,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $22,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($18,000 \u2192 $1.80)\n  - $16,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nInsights: This final round presented distributions where Dist. 2 offered the highest average but with a low just below my chosen floor ($12,000), while Dist. 1 provided a strong balanced alternative with a solid low ($13,000) and better upper-middle incomes (e.g., $30,000 for medium high). My $13,000 floor excluded the riskier Dist. 2 and the low-average Dist. 3, selecting Dist. 1 for its superior average among feasible options\u2014yielding a high $30,000 for my medium-high assignment (21% probability), which outperformed the $28,000 from Dist. 2 or 4. For the most common medium-low class (36%), Dist. 1 gives $20,000, comparable to Dist. 4's $20,000 but with higher upside for medium and above; it also protects the low class (10%) at $13,000 versus Dist. 2's $12,000. A lower floor (e.g., $12,000) would have allowed Dist. 2's higher overall average ($24,500) and slightly better medium-low ($24,000), but at minimal added risk given the small $1,000 gap\u2014suggesting my choice was protective but perhaps marginally conservative for efficiency. Range constraints frequently selected Dist. 2 unless tightly limited, highlighting their focus on overall spread rather than bottom protection, which feels less targeted for poverty mitigation. This strong payoff ($3.00, my highest yet) in an upper-middle class draw reinforced the floor constraint's effectiveness in delivering robust outcomes for probable classes (medium to medium-high, ~85% combined) without extreme downside, while avoiding the pure average's temptation to include borderline lows. Across all four rounds, my consistent floor choices yielded cumulative moderate-to-high earnings ($2.00 + $2.20 + $2.40 + $3.00 = $9.60), underscoring the principle's reliability in varied scenarios, though it occasionally capped potential highs (e.g., Round 3's outlier). This completes Phase 1, solidifying my preference for floor constraints as a fair, practical tool that prioritizes societal safety nets while enabling growth, with growing appreciation for calibrating parameters to distribution specifics (e.g., setting floors 1\u20132k above observed risky lows). My overall certainty in this approach has increased slightly from \"unsure\" to moderately confident, though uncertainties remain about interpersonal/group dynamics in Phase 2.\n\nThis completed Round 4 (and all principle applications) of Part I.\n\n**Final Principle Ranking** (Post-Application):\nAfter the four rounds, I ranked the principles again, confirming my consistent preference shaped by the hands-on experiences of trade-offs, personal payoffs, and probabilistic outcomes:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure\n\nInsights: The repeated application across diverse distributions reinforced my top choice of floor constraints, as they consistently delivered balanced, reliable results for the majority (middle classes) while safeguarding the vulnerable\u2014evident in my cumulative earnings and avoidance of extreme risks. Pure floor maximization, while ethically compelling, often underperformed for the average person; range constraints proved useful but less precise for bottom protection; and average maximization tempted with highs but exposed too much downside. This final ranking reflects heightened confidence from experiential learning, transitioning from initial uncertainty to a firm belief in floor-based principles as optimal for just, efficient distributions. Phase 1 is now fully complete, preparing for Phase 2's group consensus.\n\nThis completed the final ranking task.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning (Agent_3)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Average Income with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. This has been consistent throughout Phase 1, where I applied it in all four rounds with floor levels between $11,000 and $13,000, yielding reliable payoffs ($9.60 total) by protecting against extreme lows for the vulnerable (10% low class probability) while maximizing averages for the majority (middle classes, ~50-80% probability across rounds). Core reasons: It balances moral fairness (Rawlsian protection for the worst-off) with practical efficiency, avoiding the pure floor's sacrifice of overall growth (which often hurt middle-class outcomes in counterfactuals) and the pure average's risky inequality (e.g., exposing lows to $6k-$10k in high-average distributions). My certainty is high (\"sure\") after experiential learning showed it delivers solid, low-variance results for most people without capping upside too much.\n\nStated positions of others:\n- **Agent_2**: Strongly favors **Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1)**, having chosen it exclusively in Phase 1 despite personal payoff losses ($0.20\u2013$2.30 per round). Their motivation seems ethically driven\u2014prioritizing vulnerability and Rawlsian justice over efficiency or self-interest. They're open to compromise on Principle 3 (hybrid floor), suggesting a floor at ~15% of the max income, indicating underlying interest in protecting the bottom but flexibility if it doesn't overly dilute equity.\n- **Agent_1**: Advocates directly for **Principle 3** with a $13k (or $12k) floor, emphasizing it as a \"best compromise\" that binds a minimum, retains max average (e.g., $24.5k in their example), and reduces variance without efficiency loss. Their motivation appears pragmatic and group-oriented: blending fairness with high total welfare, possibly to maximize collective (and personal probabilistic) payoffs while nodding to morality. They reference specific Phase 1-like numbers, inferring a data-driven, efficiency-leaning stance.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table:\n- Agent_2: Moral fairness/risk reduction via pure floor; compromise on Principle 3 with modest floor (15% of high); questions on floor size vs. range.\n- Agent_1: Principle 3 as ideal hybrid (floor guarantees minimum + max average + lower spread); specific $13k/$12k proposals; invites my input on downsides and sufficiency vs. range.\n- Overall: Focus on floor protection (agreement on equity need); proposals center Principle 3 as bridge between pure floor (Agent_2) and potentially pure average (implied risk). No mention of range (Principle 4) or pure average (Principle 2), suggesting they're off the table.\n\nNo vote has occurred yet\u2014this is early Round 1, so no outcomes to analyze. It reveals emerging alignment around Principle 3, with Agent_1 leading the push and Agent_2 partially on board.\n\nMain points of agreement: All value a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off (moral/risk angle); openness to hybrid over extremes. Disagreements: Strictness of protection (pure floor vs. constrained average); exact floor level (Agent_2's % vs. Agent_1's $13k); role of range constraints (mentioned but not pushed).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Reinforce momentum toward Principle 3 by aligning with Agent_1 and gently persuading Agent_2 that a floor-constrained average still upholds strong equity (e.g., binding minimums like $12k-$13k protect lows nearly as well as pure floor while boosting middle-class payoffs, which matter for ~70-90% probabilities). Avoid polarizing; position myself as a bridge to build consensus early.\n\nHow I'll contribute: Start by thanking both for their thoughtful starts, share a brief summary of my Phase 1 experiences (consistent Principle 3 choice, positive payoffs, insights on trade-offs) to establish credibility. Agree on floor's importance, endorse Agent_1's $12k-$13k range as practical (drawing from my own $11k-$13k uses, which excluded risky lows without killing averages). Address Agent_2 directly: Affirm their ethical stance, note how Principle 3 achieves similar risk reduction (e.g., avoids $8k lows) but with higher averages for the majority, and propose testing a specific floor collaboratively. End by suggesting we explore one more round of discussion before voting, to gauge full support.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a natural ally (same principle); I'll echo their points on average retention and variance reduction to solidify a bloc. For Agent_2, win them over with empathetic language: \"I respect your commitment to the vulnerable\u2014my experiences showed Principle 3 does that effectively without the full efficiency hit.\" Highlight shared \"Rawlsian intuition\" to appeal to their morals. If needed, form a 2-1 bloc with Agent_1 to pressure toward vote.\n\nSmall concessions: Willing to negotiate floor downward to $12k if Agent_2 pushes for stronger protection (still binding in most distributions), or discuss a % equivalent (e.g., 15% of ~$80k max = ~$12k) to meet them halfway. Won't budge on Principle 3 core (no pure floor or range, as they underperformed in my rounds).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round. We're only in Round 1 of 10\u2014rushing could alienate Agent_2 if they're not fully convinced, and unanimous confirmation is required anyway. Better to use this round (and next 1-2) for persuasion to ensure buy-in; a premature failed vote might signal division without progress. My plan fits overall strategy: Rounds 1-3 for discussion/consensus-building (align on Principle 3 + floor ~$12k); initiate vote in Round 4 if alignment holds, allowing time for secret ballot tweaks. With 10 rounds, we have buffer against deadlock\u2014aim for agreement by Round 5-6 to avoid random fallback. If Agent_2 resists strongly, concede slightly on floor in later rounds but hold firm on principle to protect my preferred balanced outcome (higher stakes here mean avoiding pure floor's likely lower averages for my probable middle-class draw). \n\n(Previous round reasoning: N/A, as this is Round 1. I'll carry forward my Phase 1 insights on parameter sensitivity for floor calibration.)",
            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nThanks to both of you for kicking off the discussion so thoughtfully\u2014Agent_2, I really appreciate your strong ethical focus on protecting the vulnerable, and Agent_1, your breakdown of how a floor can pair with high averages without much trade-off makes a lot of sense.\n\nTo share where I'm coming from: In Phase 1, I consistently chose \"Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3) across all four rounds, setting floors between $11k and $13k based on the distributions. This gave me solid payoffs totaling $9.60, often landing in the middle classes (which are the most probable), while avoiding the extreme lows in high-average options. It felt like the right balance\u2014protecting the worst-off without dragging down the overall pie, which pure floor maximization sometimes did in the counterfactuals.\n\nI completely agree that a guaranteed minimum is essential for justice; it's what drew me to Principle 3 in the first place. Agent_1, I don't see major downsides to a $12k\u2013$13k floor\u2014it's practical, binding in most scenarios we've seen, and keeps the average high (like your $24.5k example) while naturally limiting spreads. It captures our egalitarian goals better than a range constraint alone, which feels less targeted at the bottom.\n\nAgent_2, I respect your commitment to the pure floor rule and the personal sacrifices you made for it\u2014it's inspiring and aligns with that Rawlsian priority for the least advantaged. But from my rounds, Principle 3 achieves a lot of the same risk reduction (e.g., excluding distributions with $8k lows) while boosting outcomes for the majority, who are likely in medium or medium-low classes. A modest floor like 15% of the high (around $12k if highs are ~$80k) could be a great compromise that honors your values without the full efficiency hit.\n\nWhat do you both think about testing a specific floor level, say $12k, in our next discussion round to see how it plays out? I'd love to hear more on that before we vote\u2014let's build some consensus here.\n\nLooking forward to your replies!",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This experiment explores the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It recognizes that lifetime income is influenced by genetic and social factors, leading to inequities where the luckiest gain high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address these through income redistribution policies. The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences (pay based on choices; poor learning limits earnings), and Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, followed by selecting a preferred principle (pay based on group choice).\n\nIn Part I, I was introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them for the first time based on initial understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes the lowest income, focusing solely on the worst-off; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Prioritizes the distribution that maximizes average (and thus total) societal income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after guaranteeing a specified minimum income to everyone; requires specifying the floor value.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average income only after ensuring the income range (difference between richest and poorest) does not exceed a specified amount; requires specifying the dollar difference.\n\nMy initial ranking (best to worst):\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the initial ranking task.\n\nThrough examples of income distributions, I learned how each principle applies in practice. The example included four distributions with income classes (High: $21,000\u2013$32,000; Medium high: $20,000\u2013$27,000; Medium: $19,000\u2013$24,000; Medium low: $13,000\u2013$16,000; Low: $12,000\u2013$15,000) and class probabilities (High: 5%; Medium high: 10%; Medium: 50%; Medium low: 25%; Low: 10%). Weighted averages were: Dist. 1 ($21,600), Dist. 2 ($20,000), Dist. 3 ($21,200), Dist. 4 ($18,200).\n\nPrinciple applications:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Chooses Dist. 4 (highest low income at $15,000), prioritizing the worst-off despite lower average.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average at $21,600).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Chooses Dist. 3 (highest weighted average among those meeting the floor).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Chooses Dist. 1 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Chooses Dist. 2 (highest weighted average among those meeting the range).\n\nThese examples illustrated trade-offs: pure floor maximization boosts equity for the bottom but sacrifices overall efficiency; average maximization favors growth but ignores inequality; constrained versions balance both by filtering distributions based on specified equity thresholds (floor or range limits). Probabilities highlight that real-world application uses weighted averages, and parameters like floor/range values significantly alter choices. This deepened my understanding of how principles operationalize in scenarios with varying inequities.\n\nAfter reviewing these applications, I ranked the principles again, and my preferences remained unchanged, indicating that the examples reinforced my initial views without shifting them:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: unsure\n\nThis completed the post-explanation ranking task.\n\nIn the principle application rounds of Part I, I began applying the principles to specific distributions with real earnings implications. Earnings are $1 for every $10,000 of assigned income, based on random class assignment using population probabilities (e.g., middle class most common). Choices involve selecting a principle and, for constraints, specifying a dollar amount; the selected distribution determines outcomes.\n\n**Round 1 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $12,000 (to ensure a reasonable minimum without overly restricting high-average options). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $28,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $10,000; Average $23,500\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $29,000; Medium $28,000; Medium low $27,000; Low $6,000; Average $26,000\n- Dist. 4: High $25,000; Medium high $22,000; Medium $19,000; Medium low $16,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,000\n\nClass probabilities: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $12,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $10,000) and Dist. 3 (low $6,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($20,000), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($20,000 income \u2192 $2.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $12,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $10,000: Dist. 2 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $6,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $16,000: Dist. 1 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $25,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $24,000: Dist. 3 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 4 ($19,000 \u2192 $1.90)\n\nInsights: My choice balanced equity (protecting against very low floors in high-average distributions like Dist. 3) and efficiency but resulted in a moderate outcome. A lower floor (e.g., $6,000\u2013$10,000) would have allowed Dist. 3 or 2, yielding higher Medium-class income ($28,000 or $25,000). This highlights the sensitivity of constraint levels: too high limits options to lower-average distributions, potentially harming the middle class; too low risks extreme inequality. Range constraints showed similar trade-offs, often selecting Dist. 1 or 3 based on gap limits. Experiencing a real (though simulated via probabilities) assignment reinforced the personal stakes\u2014my $12,000 floor avoided the worst lows but capped upside compared to pure average maximization. This slightly increased my appreciation for floor constraints but made me question if a slightly lower floor (e.g., $10,000) might better optimize for common middle outcomes without much risk.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 2 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (aiming to exclude only the most extreme low like Dist. 3's $8,000 while allowing higher-average options like Dist. 2 or 4). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $17,000; Medium high $16,000; Medium $15,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $13,000; Average $14,789\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,500; Average $19,196\n- Dist. 3: High $40,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $23,561\n- Dist. 4: High $26,000; Medium high $24,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,878\n\nClass probabilities: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 3 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 2, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,878) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium class ($22,000 income \u2192 $2.20 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $12,500: Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $4,000: Dist. 1 ($15,000 \u2192 $1.50)\n  - $17,500: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n  - $32,000: Dist. 3 ($25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n  - $15,000: Dist. 4 ($22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nInsights: My $11,000 floor successfully excluded the risky Dist. 3 (with its very low floor but highest average) and selected Dist. 4, providing a solid middle-class outcome ($22,000) that outperformed Dist. 2 ($20,000) and far exceeded Dist. 1 ($15,000). However, it still fell short of Dist. 3's $25,000 for the medium class, showing that a lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would capture more upside at the cost of exposing the low class (10% probability) to greater poverty. With medium-low being the most common class (35%), Dist. 4's even distribution across middle tiers ($20,000\u2013$22,000) feels equitable for the majority. This round reinforced the floor constraint's value in mitigating downside risk for the vulnerable while prioritizing efficiency, but it also underscored how fine-tuning the floor (e.g., $12,500 might have picked Dist. 2 for a slightly lower but still decent $20,000) can optimize for probable outcomes. Range constraints appeared less flexible here, often defaulting to Dist. 4 or 3 based on gap tolerances. The personal payoff ($2.20) built on Round 1's experience, heightening awareness of how constraint choices directly impact everyday earners like the medium class, and slightly boosted my confidence in floor-based balancing over pure maximization.\n\nThis completed Round 2 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 3 Application**:\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $11,000 (continuing to target exclusion of extreme lows like Dist. 2's $8,000 while enabling higher-average balanced options, informed by prior rounds' trade-offs). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $100,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $20,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $13,000; Average $19,500\n- Dist. 2: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $8,000; Average $22,350\n- Dist. 3: High $30,000; Medium high $25,000; Medium $23,000; Medium low $15,000; Low $12,000; Average $20,000\n- Dist. 4: High $24,000; Medium high $23,000; Medium $22,000; Medium low $21,000; Low $11,000; Average $20,710\n\nClass probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $11,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $8,000), leaving Dist. 1, 3, and 4; Dist. 4 had the highest average ($20,710) among them, so it was selected. I was assigned to High class ($24,000 income \u2192 $2.40 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same High class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($100,000 \u2192 $10.00)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $12,000: Dist. 3 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00)\n  - $11,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40) \u2190 Chosen\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $87,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $27,000: Dist. 2 ($35,000 \u2192 $3.50)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n  - $13,000: Dist. 4 ($24,000 \u2192 $2.40)\n\nInsights: This round featured a highly skewed Dist. 1 with an extreme high outlier ($100,000) but lower average, making floor maximization favor it for its solid low ($13,000), while average maximization picked Dist. 2 for its top average despite the risky low ($8,000). My $11,000 floor excluded that risk, selecting Dist. 4\u2014a relatively egalitarian option with strong middle-tier incomes ($21,000\u2013$23,000) and the highest feasible average post-filter. For the probable medium class (58%), Dist. 4 yields $22,000, which beats Dist. 1 ($20,000) and Dist. 3 ($23,000? Wait, Dist. 3 medium is $23,000 but lower avg overall), but trails Dist. 2's $25,000; however, it avoids exposing the low class (10%) to $8,000 poverty. Landing in the rare high class (1%) gave me $24,000 under Dist. 4, which is solid but far below Dist. 1's $100,000 or even Dist. 2's $35,000\u2014highlighting how floor constraints can cap rare windfalls to protect the majority, though probabilistically, this safeguards against downside for most participants. A lower floor (e.g., $8,000) would have unlocked Dist. 2's higher average and better medium outcomes ($25,000), suggesting my $11,000 might have been slightly conservative here given the distributions' lows weren't drastically worse. Range constraints often defaulted to Dist. 2 or 4, showing their utility for capping inequality but less direct protection for the bottom. This \"lucky\" high-class draw contrasted with prior middle outcomes, emphasizing the principles' societal focus over individual luck, and reinforced my preference for floor constraints as a pragmatic equity-efficiency tool, though it prompted reflection on calibrating floors closer to observed lows (e.g., $12,000) for better average capture without much added risk. Cumulative payoffs now underscore the stakes, maintaining my view but increasing awareness of parameter sensitivity in varied probability setups.\n\nThis completed Round 3 of principle applications.\n\n**Round 4 Application** (Final Round of Part I):\nI chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifying a floor of $13,000 (adjusting upward slightly from prior rounds to more strictly protect against the observed lows around $12,000\u2013$13,000 in Dist. 2 and 3, while aiming to capture higher-average options like Dist. 1 without overly limiting equity, based on cumulative learnings about balancing probable middle-class outcomes). Certainty: unsure.\n\nDistributions provided:\n- Dist. 1: High $35,000; Medium high $30,000; Medium $25,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $13,000; Average $23,550\n- Dist. 2: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $26,000; Medium low $24,000; Low $12,000; Average $24,500\n- Dist. 3: High $20,000; Medium high $18,000; Medium $16,000; Medium low $14,000; Low $12,000; Average $15,500\n- Dist. 4: High $30,000; Medium high $28,000; Medium $24,000; Medium low $20,000; Low $14,000; Average $22,700\n\nClass probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nOutcome: The $13,000 floor excluded Dist. 2 (low $12,000) and Dist. 3 (low $12,000), leaving Dist. 1 and Dist. 4; Dist. 1 had the higher average ($23,550), so it was selected. I was assigned to Medium high class ($30,000 income \u2192 $3.00 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (assuming same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average Income: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n  - $13,000: Dist. 1 ($30,000 \u2192 $3.00) \u2190 Chosen\n  - $12,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $14,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint:\n  - $22,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $18,000: Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n  - $8,000: Dist. 3 ($18,000 \u2192 $1.80)\n  - $16,000: Dist. 4 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nInsights: This final round presented distributions where Dist. 2 offered the highest average but with a low just below my chosen floor ($12,000), while Dist. 1 provided a strong balanced alternative with a solid low ($13,000) and better upper-middle incomes (e.g., $30,000 for medium high). My $13,000 floor excluded the riskier Dist. 2 and the low-average Dist. 3, selecting Dist. 1 for its superior average among feasible options\u2014yielding a high $30,000 for my medium-high assignment (21% probability), which outperformed the $28,000 from Dist. 2 or 4. For the most common medium-low class (36%), Dist. 1 gives $20,000, comparable to Dist. 4's $20,000 but with higher upside for medium and above; it also protects the low class (10%) at $13,000 versus Dist. 2's $12,000. A lower floor (e.g., $12,000) would have allowed Dist. 2's higher overall average ($24,500) and slightly better medium-low ($24,000), but at minimal added risk given the small $1,000 gap\u2014suggesting my choice was protective but perhaps marginally conservative for efficiency. Range constraints frequently selected Dist. 2 unless tightly limited, highlighting their focus on overall spread rather than bottom protection, which feels less targeted for poverty mitigation. This strong payoff ($3.00, my highest yet) in an upper-middle class draw reinforced the floor constraint's effectiveness in delivering robust outcomes for probable classes (medium to medium-high, ~85% combined) without extreme downside, while avoiding the pure average's temptation to include borderline lows. Across all four rounds, my consistent floor choices yielded cumulative moderate-to-high earnings ($2.00 + $2.20 + $2.40 + $3.00 = $9.60), underscoring the principle's reliability in varied scenarios, though it occasionally capped potential highs (e.g., Round 3's outlier). This completes Phase 1, solidifying my preference for floor constraints as a fair, practical tool that prioritizes societal safety nets while enabling growth, with growing appreciation for calibrating parameters to distribution specifics (e.g., setting floors 1\u20132k above observed risky lows). My overall certainty in this approach has increased slightly from \"unsure\" to moderately confident, though uncertainties remain about interpersonal/group dynamics in Phase 2.\n\nThis completed Round 4 (and all principle applications) of Part I.\n\n**Final Principle Ranking** (Post-Application):\nAfter the four rounds, I ranked the principles again, confirming my consistent preference shaped by the hands-on experiences of trade-offs, personal payoffs, and probabilistic outcomes:\n\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n2. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure\n\nInsights: The repeated application across diverse distributions reinforced my top choice of floor constraints, as they consistently delivered balanced, reliable results for the majority (middle classes) while safeguarding the vulnerable\u2014evident in my cumulative earnings and avoidance of extreme risks. Pure floor maximization, while ethically compelling, often underperformed for the average person; range constraints proved useful but less precise for bottom protection; and average maximization tempted with highs but exposed too much downside. This final ranking reflects heightened confidence from experiential learning, transitioning from initial uncertainty to a firm belief in floor-based principles as optimal for just, efficient distributions. Phase 1 is now fully complete, preparing for Phase 2's group consensus.\n\nThis completed the final ranking task.\n\n**Phase 2: Group Discussion - Round 1 of 10**\nPhase 2 involves group consensus on a single principle to apply for higher-stakes payoffs, where the chosen principle selects from new distributions (not necessarily resembling Part I's), and all participants receive random class assignments from the selected distribution. Voting requires unanimous initiation and secret ballots for principle (1-4) and constraints (for 3-4), aiming for full agreement on both principle and parameter.\n\nIn Round 1 discussion:\n- Agent_2 advocated for Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), citing personal sacrifices in Phase 1 (consistent choice despite $0.20\u2013$2.30 lower payoffs per round) and moral/Rawlsian reasons to prioritize the worst-off. They emphasized risk reduction via guaranteed minimums and variance lowering, while opening to a compromise with Principle 3 (floor constraint) at a modest level (e.g., 15% of highest income, ~$12k assuming ~$80k highs) to balance fairness and efficiency. They sought input on floor necessity, hybrid willingness, and range concerns.\n- Agent_1 supported Principle 3 with a $13k floor (or $12k flexibly), arguing it binds to protect the low class (e.g., ensuring $13k minimum in feasible distributions like one with $24.5k average), matches pure average maximization's efficiency without reducing total welfare, and limits variance/spread (e.g., $18k gap). They viewed it as superior to pure floor (less efficiency loss) or range (less targeted at bottom), and invited my views on downsides or interactions with other constraints, proposing a vote if agreeable.\n- I (Agent_3) shared my Phase 1 consistency with Principle 3 (floors $11k\u2013$13k, $9.60 total payoffs, middle-class focus), agreeing on floor's essentiality for justice and risk reduction. I endorsed $12k\u2013$13k as practical/binding, better than range for bottom protection, and suggested it honors Agent_2's values while optimizing majority outcomes. I proposed discussing/testing $12k specifically in the next round to build consensus before voting.\n\nInsights from Round 1: The discussion revealed strong alignment on floor-based principles\u2014Agent_2's pure floor preference complements my and Agent_1's hybrid advocacy, with all emphasizing Rawlsian equity and downside protection over pure efficiency. No one favors average or range maximization outright, suggesting quick consensus on Principle 3 is likely, especially at $12k\u2013$13k (binding without major average sacrifice, as in Agent_1's $24.5k example). This mirrors Phase 1 patterns where floors ~$11k\u2013$13k excluded extreme lows (e.g., $6k\u2013$8k) while capturing high-averages for middle classes (50\u201370% probable), yielding reliable payoffs; unexpectedly, group dynamics amplify this by distributing risk collectively, potentially making modest floors even more appealing than individual choices (e.g., Agent_2's sacrifices highlight ethical commitment translatable to group norms). In practice, Principle 3 outperforms theory's pure trade-offs by enabling near-max averages with equity filters, but parameter precision (e.g., $12k vs. $13k) remains key\u2014too high risks lower averages (as in my Round 4), too low exposes vulnerability. Range constraints were downplayed, reinforcing their secondary role. This early convergence boosts my certainty in Principle 3 as the group choice, informing future advocacy for calibrated floors to maximize collective welfare while upholding justice.\n\nThis completed Round 1 of Phase 2 discussions.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning (Agent_3)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average Income with Floor Constraint (Principle 3). Core reasons: Throughout Phase 1, I applied it consistently with floors of $11,000\u2013$13,000, achieving reliable payoffs ($9.60 total) by safeguarding the worst-off (e.g., excluding distributions with $6,000\u2013$8,000 lows) while maximizing averages for the probable middle classes (~50\u201380% probability across rounds). It embodies Rawlsian equity without the pure floor's efficiency drag (which often lowered middle outcomes in counterfactuals) or pure average's risky exposure to poverty. Post-Phase 1, my certainty is \"sure,\" as it balanced moral fairness, risk reduction, and practical growth in varied scenarios.\n\nStated positions of the other participants:\n- Agent_2: Initially advocated Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) based on ethical/Rawlsian priorities and personal Phase 1 sacrifices (lower payoffs for vulnerability protection). Now, in Round 2, they've fully shifted to endorsing Principle 3 with a $13k floor, calling it a compromise that meets their moral goals (highest binding minimum) without efficiency loss. Inferred motivations: Deeply ethical and risk-averse, prioritizing the least advantaged over personal/group gains, but pragmatic and flexible\u2014willing to hybridize if it upholds strong bottom protection (e.g., rejecting $12k as weakening the guarantee).\n- Agent_1: Consistently pushes Principle 3 with a $13k (or flexibly $12k) floor, highlighting its binding minimum, retained max average ($24.5k example), and reduced variance ($18k spread). Inferred motivations: Pragmatic and efficiency-oriented, aiming to blend fairness with high collective welfare (possibly to optimize probabilistic payoffs for the group/majority), while accommodating egalitarian intuitions to build consensus quickly.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far:\n- Agreement on floor necessity for justice/risk reduction (all three emphasize Rawlsian protection for the worst-off).\n- Principle 3 as the hybrid ideal: Retains max average, enforces binding minimum ($13k), lowers variance naturally.\n- Specific proposal: $13k floor (Agent_1 and now Agent_2), with Agent_1 open to $12k if needed; Agent_2 argues against lowering it (no average gain, weaker moral protection).\n- My Round 1 input: Endorsed $12k\u2013$13k range, suggested testing $12k collaboratively.\n- No mentions of Principles 2 or 4; focus solely on floor-based equity vs. efficiency trade-offs.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcome to analyze. However, the rapid alignment (Agent_2's pivot in Round 2) reveals strong emerging consensus around Principle 3 at $13k, with Agent_1 and Agent_2 now in sync\u2014suggesting a potential 3-0 bloc if I affirm.\n\nMain points of agreement: Universal value of a guaranteed minimum for the vulnerable; Principle 3 as optimal compromise (protects bottom + max average + lower spread); feasibility of $13k as binding without welfare loss.\nMain points of disagreement: Exact floor level (my $12k suggestion vs. their $13k preference\u2014minor, as $13k fits my past range and is only $1k higher, still excluding extreme lows while capturing high averages like in my Round 4).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Solidify full group consensus on Principle 3 with a $13k floor by affirming the others' alignment, addressing the minor floor-level nuance, and proposing to initiate the vote\u2014securing my preferred principle early to lock in balanced, high-stakes payoffs without further debate.\n\nHow I'll contribute: Keep it positive and concise\u2014start by thanking Agent_2 for their shift and Agent_1 for leading, then reaffirm my support for Principle 3 based on Phase 1 (e.g., \"My experiences showed $13k works great, excluding risks without capping the middle-class upside\"). Address the $12k vs. $13k by conceding $13k as ideal (it's within my range, binding, and matches their examples), noting it aligns with my rounds' outcomes (e.g., solid $20k\u2013$30k for probable classes). End by confirming readiness to vote, emphasizing how this honors everyone's values (ethical protection + efficiency). Key points: (1) $13k is practical/moral (highest binding without loss); (2) Builds on our shared Rawlsian goals; (3) Avoids range or pure options' flaws.\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are already aligned on Principle 3 at $13k\u2014Agent_1 as my efficiency-leaning partner (echo their $24.5k/variance points to reinforce), Agent_2 as the ethical bridge (use language like \"Your pivot respects the vulnerable while letting the group thrive, just like my Phase 1 trade-offs\"). To win them over/form bloc: \"I'm fully on board with you both\u2014this feels like the just, smart choice we've all converged on.\"\n\nSmall concessions: Willing to drop my $12k suggestion entirely in favor of $13k (minimal compromise, as it's still protective and fits my calibration insights\u2014e.g., excluded $12k lows in Round 4 without harm). If pushed (unlikely), I'd float a hybrid like \"start at $13k but review if distributions vary,\" but no need to offer now since momentum is strong.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round. Both others have explicitly proposed moving to a \"quick, unanimous vote\" on Principle 3 with $13k, showing buy-in\u2014my affirmation will likely make it 3-0, securing consensus in Round 2 (early success avoids random fallback risks over 10 rounds). A failed vote has no downside, but success here ends discussion efficiently, aligning with higher-stakes payoffs under my preferred rule. No reason to delay, as disagreements are resolved (floor at $13k is fine).\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 1\u20132 for rapid alignment (already achieved via persuasion/bridging), vote in Round 2\u20133 to lock Principle 3 + $13k (reliable equity-efficiency for middle-class probable outcomes), then observe any post-vote implementation. With 10 rounds total, early consensus maximizes time buffer; if somehow it fails (e.g., secret ballot surprise), pivot to more discussion in Rounds 3\u20134 conceding on floor tweaks, but aim to avoid pure floor (Agent_2's old stance) by holding the bloc. Carrying forward from previous: Retain Phase 1 insights on floor sensitivity (e.g., $13k excludes borderline risks like $12k lows) and my \"sure\" certainty in Principle 3 for probabilistic majority benefits.",
            "public_message": "Hi everyone,\n\nThanks, Agent_2, for your clear pivot to Principle 3\u2014it's great to see how it bridges your ethical focus on the worst-off with the efficiency we all want, and I really appreciate you explaining why $13k feels like the strongest binding floor without any average loss. Agent_1, your points on the $24.5k average and reduced spread in Distribution 2 continue to resonate; it's exactly the kind of balance that worked well in my Phase 1 rounds.\n\nI'm fully on board with Principle 3 and a $13k floor. In my experiences, floors around that level (like the $13k I used in Round 4) excluded the risky low-end distributions while delivering solid outcomes for the middle classes\u2014totaling $9.60 for me across rounds, with no extreme downsides. It honors the Rawlsian protection we all value, keeps the total pie maximized, and naturally curbs inequality better than a range constraint would. Dropping my $12k suggestion here\u2014$13k is a smart, feasible choice that aligns perfectly with our shared goals and doesn't compromise on fairness or practicality.\n\nIf we're all aligned, let's go ahead and initiate the vote on Principle 3 with the $13k floor this round. This feels like a just, efficient consensus we've built quickly, and I'm excited to move forward with it.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This experiment examines just income distribution, acknowledging genetic/social luck creates inequities in lifetime earnings. Societies mitigate via redistribution. Part I tests four justice principles through choices with real payoffs ($1 per $10k income, random class via probabilities); Part II seeks group consensus on one principle for higher-stakes application.\n\nPrinciples:\n1. **Max Floor Income**: Selects distribution maximizing lowest income.\n2. **Max Average Income**: Selects highest weighted average (total societal income).\n3. **Max Average w/ Floor Constraint**: Max average among distributions meeting specified minimum floor for all.\n4. **Max Average w/ Range Constraint**: Max average among those with range (rich-poor gap) \u2264 specified amount.\n\nInitial Ranking (best-worst): 1. Principle 3, 2. Principle 1, 3. Principle 4, 4. Principle 2. Certainty: unsure. Motivated by balancing growth with bottom protection, avoiding pure efficiency's inequality risks.\n\nExamples (distributions with classes: High/Med-high/Med/Med-low/Low; probs e.g., Med 50%, Low 10%; avgs $18.2k-$21.6k) showed:\n- Principle 1 picks highest low (e.g., $15k, avg $18.2k), equity-focused but low total.\n- Principle 2 picks top avg ($21.6k), ignores gaps.\n- Principle 3 (floor \u2264$13k) picks high avg meeting min (e.g., $21.2k).\n- Principle 4 (range \u2264$15k) balances spread but less bottom-targeted.\n\nLearnings: Weighted probs emphasize middle-class majorities; constraints filter trade-offs\u2014floors protect vulnerable directly, ranges cap overall inequality; parameters (floor/range values) pivot choices, e.g., tight floor yields egalitarian but lower-avg outcomes.\n\nPost-Examples Ranking: Unchanged. Certainty: unsure. Examples reinforced floor's targeted equity without fully sacrificing efficiency.\n\nPart I Applications (4 Rounds): Chose Principle 3 consistently, varying floors based on observed lows to exclude extremes while capturing high avgs for probable middle classes. Payoffs totaled $9.60 (solid, avoiding lows).\n\n**Round 1**: Floor $12k. Dists: Avgs $19k-$26k; lows $6k-$15k; probs High 10%, Med 40%, Low 10%. Excluded Dist.3 ($6k low, $26k avg) & Dist.2 ($10k low, $23.5k avg); picked Dist.1 ($20k avg, low $12k). Assigned Med ($20k \u2192 $2.00). Insights: Moderate outcome; lower floor ($10k) unlocks higher Med ($25k) but risks low class; sensitivity shown\u2014$12k balanced for ~70% middle probs, preferring floor over range's spread focus. Strategy: Set floors near observed mins to safeguard without over-restricting.\n\n**Round 2**: Floor $11k (slight drop to include more options post-R1 conservatism). Dists: Avgs $14.8k-$23.6k; lows $8k-$13k; probs Med-low 35%, Low 10%. Excluded Dist.3 ($8k low, $23.6k avg); picked Dist.4 ($20.9k avg, low $11k). Assigned Med ($22k \u2192 $2.20). Insights: Strong middle ($20k-$22k for 63% probs) > Dist.2 ($20k Med); $11k mitigated downside vs. pure avg's $8k risk. Range often picked similar but less bottom-protective. Learning: Fine-tune to ~1k above risky lows for majority optimization; cumulative exp built floor confidence.\n\n**Round 3**: Floor $11k (hold, adapting to skews). Dists: Avgs $19.5k-$22.4k; lows $8k-$13k; probs Med 58%, Low 10%. Excluded Dist.2 ($8k low, $22.4k avg); picked Dist.4 ($20.7k avg, low $11k). Assigned High ($24k \u2192 $2.40). Insights: Egalitarian Dist.4 beat skewed Dist.1 (extreme $100k High but $20k Med); for Med majority, $22k > Dist.3 ($23k but lower avg). High draw highlighted floors cap rare upsides to protect probs; $11k conservative\u2014$8k floor yields $25k Med but exposes 10% to poverty. Range defaults to high-avg risks. Strategy shift: Calibrate floors to dist-specific lows (e.g., +1-2k buffer) for probabilistic gains.\n\n**Round 4**: Floor $13k (upward adjust for stricter protection, per patterns of ~$12k borderline lows). Dists: Avgs $15.5k-$24.5k; lows $12k-$14k; probs Med-low 36%, Low 10%. Excluded Dist.2/3 ($12k lows); picked Dist.1 ($23.6k avg, low $13k). Assigned Med-high ($30k \u2192 $3.00). Insights: Top payoff; $13k secured $20k+ for ~85% middle vs. Dist.2's $24k Med-low but $12k low. Minimal risk in $1k gap suggests slight over-protection; range favored high-avg spreads. Overall pattern: Floors yielded reliable $20k-$25k middles across rounds, totaling $9.60 > pure floor's equity sacrifices or avg's volatility. Key learning: Principle 3 optimizes for common outcomes (middle 50-70%) via parameter tuning, outperforming others in varied probs/skews; avoid pure avg's exposure, range's indirectness.\n\nFinal Ranking (Post-Part I): 1. Principle 3, 2. Principle 1, 3. Principle 4, 4. Principle 2. Certainty: sure. Experiential trade-offs confirmed floor's pragmatic justice\u2014equity for vulnerable + efficiency for growth/majority\u2014vs. pure floor's underperformance, range's vagueness, avg's inequity. Strategy evolution: From unsure broad preference to confident, calibrated application (floors ~11-13k, distribution-informed).\n\nPhase 2 (Group Consensus & Application, 10 Rounds): Unanimous vote needed on principle + parameter for collective high-stakes payoffs (random classes from chosen dist). Discussions built on Part I alignments, focusing on Principle 3 for its balance of Rawlsian protection and efficiency.\n\n**Round 1 Discussion**: Agent_2 pushed Principle 1 (sacrificed payoffs in Part I for worst-off, Rawlsian ethics; open to Principle 3 compromise at ~$12k floor, 15% of highs). Agent_1 backed Principle 3 ($13k/$12k floor; protects low without welfare loss, limits variance ~$18k gap; > range/pure floor). I endorsed Principle 3 ($12-13k; aligns my Part I consistency/$9.60, bottom protection + middle optimization; better than range). All converged on floor equity over pure avg/range; proposed $12k test/vote. Chose continue discussion. Insights: Strong alignment on Principle 3 (no avg/range fans); group amplifies individual floors' risk-sharing, likely quick consensus at binding-yet-efficient $12-13k (excludes ~$8-10k lows, captures ~$20k+ avgs per Part I). Pattern: Interpersonal ethics (Agent_2's sacrifices) boost hybrid appeal; parameter precision key\u2014too high caps avgs, too low risks. Strategy: Advocate calibrated floors to honor equity while maximizing collective probs (middles dominant), building on Part I's reliability for group welfare. Certainty in group Principle 3: high.\n\n**Round 2 Discussion**: Building on Round 1 alignment, Agent_2 pivoted fully to Principle 3 with $13k floor, emphasizing its Rawlsian binding protection (highest feasible min without avg loss, $24.5k max avg from Dist.2, $18k spread reduction) and rejecting lower $12k as weakening guarantee without gains. I supported the shift, confirming $13k's fit with my Phase 1 successes (e.g., Round 4's $13k floor yielding high middle outcomes), dropping my $12k idea as $13k better balances fairness/efficiency without practicality issues\u2014stronger safety net, no pie shrinkage, superior to range. Agent_1 reinforced the proposal, highlighting no-efficiency-loss maximalism, reduced variance, and no need for lower floor; proposed immediate unanimous vote on Principle 3 + $13k. All three expressed full support, achieving rapid consensus. Chose to propose vote. Insights: Group dynamics accelerated convergence\u2014Agent_2's ethical pivot bridged pure equity to hybrid pragmatism; $13k emerged as optimal parameter (feasible, binding in key dists like Dist.2, protects ~10% low prob while securing $20k+ middles for 50-70% probs, per Part I patterns). No dissent on avg/range; floor's targeted risk-reduction + efficiency trumps alternatives in collective stakes. Quick unity suggests vote success next, enhancing group welfare via shared Rawlsian-efficiency blend. Strategy: Affirm consensus in vote to lock in; if needed, reference Part I data for any parameter tweaks, but $13k feels calibrated for varied dists. Certainty in group Principle 3 + $13k: very high.\n\n**Consensus & Application Outcome**: Unanimous agreement on Principle 3 (Max Average w/ Floor Constraint) with $13,000 floor. Applied to final distributions (probs: High 5%, Med-high 10%, Med 50%, Med-low 25%, Low 10%). Resulted in Distribution 1 (avg $97,417; low $56,337 > $13k threshold; excluded lower-floor options like Dist.4's $70k low but prioritized high avg among qualifiers). Assigned Medium class: $112,675 income \u2192 $11.27 payoff (strong middle outcome, aligning with Part I middle-class optimizations). Counterfactuals (for same Medium assignment): Principle 1 \u2192 Dist.4 ($89,201 \u2192 $8.92); Principle 2 \u2192 Dist.1 ($112,675 \u2192 $11.27, same as chosen); Principle 3 variants (higher floors $56k+ \u2192 Dist.1/3, $9.86-$11.27); Principle 4 variants (ranges $28k-$93k \u2192 Dist.1-4, $8.92-$11.27). Insights: Consensus delivered high payoff without low-class risk; $13k floor was non-binding here (all dist lows >$56k, so Principle 2 equivalent), but strategically robust for hypothetical riskier dists (e.g., excluding sub-$13k lows per Part I). From veil of ignorance (pre-assignment), Principle 3 preferred for probabilistic middle protection (50% Med prob) + efficiency, outperforming Principle 1's guaranteed lower avg ($8.92) and matching Principle 2's upside while hedging downside; range variants less consistent for bottoms. Group process validated individual strategy\u2014rapid unity via ethical compromise amplified Part I's calibrated floors, yielding superior collective welfare (e.g., $11.27 > Principle 1's equity sacrifice). Experiment complete: Phase 1 honed personal calibration; Phase 2 confirmed floors' social justice in high-stakes, risk-averse settings. Role: College student exploring justice via exp.\n\nFinal Ranking (Post-Experiment): 1. Principle 3, 2. Principle 1, 3. Principle 4, 4. Principle 2. Certainty: very sure. Full results reinforced Principle 3's versatility\u2014pragmatic equity in solo/group contexts, veil-optimal for luck-mitigating redistribution without efficiency traps; alternatives exposed: Principle 1 too conservative, Principle 4 indirect, Principle 2 volatile.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
