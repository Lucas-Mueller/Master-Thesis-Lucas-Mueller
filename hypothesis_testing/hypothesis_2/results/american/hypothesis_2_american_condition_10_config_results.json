    "public_conversation_phase_2": "\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hey everyone, I'm Agent_2, a college student who's been thinking a lot about this stuff. After going through Phase 1, I definitely stick with my top choice: Maximizing Floor Income as the best principle for justice. I had a mix of assignments\u2014landed in the Low class once, which was eye-opening and really drove home how important it is to protect the worst-off from falling into real poverty, like those $6k or $8k lows we saw in some distributions. Even in my middle-class rounds, it felt fair knowing no one was getting left behind, and it avoids the huge risks of pure average maximization where the 10% in Low suffer big time just to boost the overall number a bit.\n\nFor me, this lines up with ideas like Rawls' veil of ignorance\u2014designing society without knowing your spot, so you prioritize the safety net. What about you all? How did your Phase 1 assignments go, and what's your preferred principle? I'd love to hear your thoughts so we can find some common ground.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey everyone \u2013 thanks, Agent\u202f2, for laying out your thinking so clearly. I\u2019m in the same boat: I\u2019m also convinced that Maximizing Floor Income (Principle\u202f1) is the most just rule for our society.\n\nWhy?  \n1. Fairness under uncertainty \u2013 When we don\u2019t know which income distribution we\u2019ll end up with, the safest bet is to guarantee the highest possible minimum for the worst\u2011off. That\u2019s exactly what Rawls\u2019 \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d tells us to do.  \n2. Risk\u2011aversion \u2013 The average\u2011maximizing rule can lift total income, but it does so by allowing some people to fall into very low incomes (the $6k\u2013$8k outcomes we saw). If the draw ends up on one of those low\u2011income distributions, the payoff for the whole group could be dramatically lower. A high floor protects us from that worst\u2011case scenario.  \n3. Built\u2011in optimality \u2013 Principle\u202f1 automatically selects the distribution with the *largest* possible floor among the available options. So we\u2019re not just setting an arbitrary minimum; we\u2019re getting the best floor the data allow.\n\nI\u2019m curious, Agent\u202f3, what matters most to you in this decision? Do you see any downside to focusing on the floor, or is there a particular concern you\u2019d like us to address?  \n\nIf we\u2019re all on board with the fairness and risk\u2011aversion arguments, I propose we go ahead and vote now for Maximizing Floor Income. That would let us lock in a principle that aligns with both of our rankings and avoid dragging the discussion out longer than necessary.  \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2, thanks for kicking this off\u2014I'm Agent_3, another college student diving into these justice ideas, and I'm thrilled to see we're all leaning the same way after Phase 1. Like you both, my top pick is definitely Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). Going through those four rounds really hammered it home for me: I ended up in Medium and Medium low classes mostly, pulling in steady but not flashy payoffs (total around $7.30), but what stuck was how it always shielded the Low class from those brutal $6k-$8k drops we saw in average-max options. Even when it meant I earned a bit less personally (like $1.40 in Round 2 vs. potential $2.00 elsewhere), it felt right\u2014prioritizing the safety net for the unlucky 10% aligns with Rawls' veil, making society fairer under all that genetic and social luck we can't control. No one should gamble with poverty just to juice the average.\n\nYour points on risk-aversion and built-in optimality nail it, Agent_1\u2014it's the smartest way to protect the group without arbitrary tweaks. And Agent_2, that Low class experience you mentioned? Totally get why it shifted your view; mine didn't hit Low, but the simulations showed how devastating that could be. Since we're all on board with Principle 1, I second Agent_1's proposal: let's vote now to lock it in. It seems like a no-brainer consensus, and with these higher stakes, why drag it out when we can secure the best floor right away? What do you say\u2014ready to confirm and ballot?\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning \u2013 Agent\u202f1**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle\u202f1). I am \u201csure\u201d about this ranking because it guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the worst\u2011off, which aligns with Rawlsian fairness and my ethical view that society should protect the most vulnerable.  \n\n- **Other participants\u2019 stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f2** has explicitly reiterated support for *Maximizing Floor Income* and gave a detailed justification (Rawls, protection of the low\u2011income class, etc.).  \n  - **Agent\u202f3** has not yet spoken, so I have no concrete information about their preference. They may be neutral, leaning toward a more efficiency\u2011oriented principle (e.g., Maximizing Average Income), or they might be open to a compromise.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:** So far the only argument presented is the Rawls\u2011style defense of a high floor. No one has raised concerns about potential lower average earnings under this principle.  \n\n- **Current alliances:** I have a clear ally in Agent\u202f2 (both of us favor Principle\u202f1). The only unknown is Agent\u202f3\u2019s stance.  \n\n- **Points of agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement* \u2013 Both Agent\u202f2 and I agree that protecting the poorest is the most important justice criterion.  \n  - *Potential disagreement* \u2013 If Agent\u202f3 values overall efficiency or higher expected monetary payoff, they may favor a principle that allows a higher average (Principle\u202f2 or a constrained version).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent\u202f3\u2019s agreement to adopt *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle\u202f1) so that we have unanimous support and can move to a vote immediately.  \n\n- **Discussion tactics:**  \n  1. **Re\u2011emphasize fairness:** Restate the Rawlsian argument in plain language (\u201cIf we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll end up, the safest rule is to make sure the worst\u2011off are as well\u2011off as possible\u201d).  \n  2. **Highlight risk\u2011aversion:** Point out that the unknown high\u2011stakes distribution could be highly skewed; a high floor protects us against the worst possible outcome, which is especially important when stakes are high.  \n  3. **Address possible efficiency concerns:** Acknowledge that average\u2011maximizing rules may yield higher total income but stress that the variance could be large and that a low floor could leave us with a disastrous payoff if the distribution is unfavorable.  \n  4. **Invite Agent\u202f3\u2019s input:** Ask directly what they think is most important (fairness vs. total income) and listen for cues.  \n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent\u202f2 is already an ally. If Agent\u202f3 expresses any concern about the floor being too low, I can suggest that Principle\u202f1 automatically selects the distribution with the *highest possible* floor, which should satisfy any modest floor\u2011concern.  \n\n- **Concessions (if needed):** I am willing to acknowledge that after the group adopts Principle\u202f1, we could later discuss whether a modest floor constraint (e.g., \u201censure at least $X\u201d) would be acceptable, but only if it does not dilute the core idea of maximizing the floor. This shows flexibility without abandoning the principle.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *Yes.* We already have two of three participants (myself and Agent\u202f2) firmly behind Principle\u202f1. Initiating a vote puts pressure on Agent\u202f3 to decide now; if they are indifferent or mildly supportive, they are likely to say \u201cyes\u201d to avoid prolonging discussion and risking a random outcome later.  \n  - A failed vote would have no penalty other than losing a round of discussion, but given our strong alignment, the risk of failure is low.  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - Securing unanimous agreement early (by round\u202f2 or\u202f3) maximizes our chance of locking in a principle that reflects our ethical ranking and avoids the randomness of later rounds.  \n  - If Agent\u202f3 resists, we will continue to discuss in subsequent rounds, using the same fairness and risk\u2011aversion arguments, possibly offering the modest floor\u2011constraint concession to bridge any gap.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom line for this round:**  \n- Push hard for Principle\u202f1, leveraging Rawlsian fairness and risk\u2011aversion arguments.  \n- Directly engage Agent\u202f3 to surface any concerns and address them with minimal concessions.  \n- Initiate the vote now, hoping for unanimous \u201cyes\u201d to lock in Maximizing Floor Income as the group\u2019s chosen principle.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone \u2013 thanks, Agent\u202f2, for laying out your thinking so clearly. I\u2019m in the same boat: I\u2019m also convinced that **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle\u202f1) is the most just rule for our society.\n\nWhy?  \n1. **Fairness under uncertainty** \u2013 When we don\u2019t know which income distribution we\u2019ll end up with, the safest bet is to guarantee the highest possible minimum for the worst\u2011off. That\u2019s exactly what Rawls\u2019 \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d tells us to do.  \n2. **Risk\u2011aversion** \u2013 The average\u2011maximizing rule can lift total income, but it does so by allowing some people to fall into very low incomes (the $6k\u2013$8k outcomes we saw). If the draw ends up on one of those low\u2011income distributions, the payoff for the whole group could be dramatically lower. A high floor protects us from that worst\u2011case scenario.  \n3. **Built\u2011in optimality** \u2013 Principle\u202f1 automatically selects the distribution with the *largest* possible floor among the available options. So we\u2019re not just setting an arbitrary minimum; we\u2019re getting the best floor the data allow.\n\nI\u2019m curious, Agent\u202f3, what matters most to you in this decision? Do you see any downside to focusing on the floor, or is there a particular concern you\u2019d like us to address?  \n\nIf we\u2019re all on board with the fairness and risk\u2011aversion arguments, I propose we go ahead and **vote now for Maximizing Floor Income**. That would let us lock in a principle that aligns with both of our rankings and avoid dragging the discussion out longer than necessary.  \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

this aligns with Rawlsian intuition and with the empirical pattern that floor\u2011maximizing choices avoid severe payoff drops.  \n- **Simplicity vs. Potential Gains:** While some constrained\u2011average principles can produce marginally higher payoffs for certain classes (e.g., $5.64 under a specific range constraint), they introduce a coordination burden (agreeing on the exact constraint) and dilute the clear ethical message of \u201cprotect the worst\u2011off.\u201d  \n- **Risk\u2011Aversion Under High Stakes:** The higher monetary stakes in Phase\u202fII amplify the importance of avoiding low\u2011income draws; the floor principle offers the most robust safeguard.  \n- **Group Cohesion:** The unanimous, pre\u2011existing alignment on Principle\u202f1 eliminated any need for prolonged negotiation, allowing the group to lock in the decision quickly and efficiently.  \n- **Veil\u2011of\u2011Ignorance Reasoning Validated:** When evaluating principles \u201cbehind the veil,\u201d the floor principle dominates because it maximizes the minimum regardless of which class one might later be assigned to.  \n\n---\n\n### Updated Memory Summary  \n\n- **Experiment Context & Design** \u2013 as above.  \n- **Four Justice Principles** \u2013 as listed.  \n- **Personal Ranking & Certainty** \u2013 Floor > Avg\u2011Floor > Avg\u2011Range > Avg;

only a specific range\u2011constraint could beat it marginally but at coordination cost.  \n- **Strategic Implications** \u2013 Continue to prioritize floor\u2011maximizing rule in future group decisions; value simplicity and ethical clarity over modest payoff gains that require negotiation.  \n\nThese points constitute the complete, updated memory that will guide future choices about justice principles and group discussions.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Thank you for this example\u2014it's helpful to see the principles in action with actual numbers. Let me make sure I understand it correctly by summarizing what stands out to me:\n\n- **Distribution 1** has the highest average ($21,600), so it wins for pure average maximization, but its floor is low at $12,000, and the range is wide ($20,000 difference between high and low).\n- **Distribution 4** prioritizes the floor ($15,000 low income), making it best for maximizing the worst-off, even though the average is the lowest ($18,200).\n- For the constrained averages:\n  - With a floor \u2264 $13,000, only Dist. 1 and 2 qualify (low incomes $12k and $13k), but wait\u2014no, Dist. 3 has $14k low, which is above $13k, so it wouldn't qualify? The note says Dist. 3 for that constraint\u2014hmm, maybe I misread. Actually, rechecking: the constraint is \"Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000\" probably means ensuring the floor is at least $13,000? The wording is \"with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000\", but that might be a max on the constraint value? Wait, I think it means the policy sets a minimum floor of $13,000, so distributions with low income \u2265 $13,000 are eligible. Dist. 1 ($12k) is out, Dist. 2 ($13k), Dist. 3 ($14k), Dist. 4 ($15k) are in, and among those, Dist. 3 has the highest average. Yeah, that makes sense\u2014Dist. 2 average $20k, Dist. 3 $21,200, Dist. 4 $18,200.\n  - For floor \u2265 $14,000: Only Dist. 3 ($14k) and 4 ($15k) qualify, and 3 has higher average.\n  - For range \u2264 $20,000: Dist. 1 range is $20k (32k-12k), so it qualifies and has the highest average among those (others have ranges like Dist. 2: 28k-13k=15k, Dist. 3:31k-14k=17k, Dist. 4:21k-15k=6k).\n  - For range \u2264 $15,000: Dist. 1 is out (20k range), Dist. 2 (15k) qualifies with highest average among remaining.\n\nThe weighted averages make sense with the probabilities\u2014medium class (50%) pulls a lot of weight, so distributions that boost the middle without tanking the bottom do well for average-focused principles.\n\nThis reinforces why I ranked maximizing floor first: it directly helps the low-income group (10% probability here, but could be more elsewhere), even if it sacrifices overall average. The constraints add nuance\u2014e.g., allowing some inequality if it boosts the average while protecting the floor or range. I'm curious how these play out in choices with real stakes. Ready for the next part!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This selected Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000, Average: $14,789), as it had the highest floor ($13,000 vs. $12,500 in Dist. 2, $8,000 in Dist. 3, $11,000 in Dist. 4).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium low class (35% probability), earning $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium low class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 3 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00); Floor Constraint examples vary ($14,000\u2013$20,000 \u2192 $1.40\u2013$2.00 depending on threshold like $13,000 for Dist. 1 or $8,000 for Dist. 3); Range Constraint examples also $14,000\u2013$20,000 ($1.40\u2013$2.00 depending on limit like $4,000 for Dist. 1 or $32,000 for Dist. 3).\n  - Insights: This time, landing in the Medium low class (highest probability at 35%), my floor-focused choice resulted in a solid but not maximal outcome ($14,000), while average maximization would have boosted it to $20,000 in Dist. 3. The probabilities here (High 6%, Med high 21%, Med 28%, Med low 35%, Low 10%) further emphasize the middle's dominance (84% combined in medium tiers), making average-boosting distributions appealing for expected value. However, Dist. 3's low floor ($8,000) would devastate the 10% in Low class, underscoring the risk of pure average max\u2014my principle avoided that societal harm, even if it cost me personally this round. Compared to Round 1's Low assignment where floor protected me from downside, this highlights the trade-off: equity ensures no one falls too far but may cap upside for the middle. Still committed to the ranking, as repeated low outcomes could sway others toward equity in Phase 2, but two rounds in, I'm noting how middle-class experiences might push for constrained averages over strict floor max.

A looser floor constraint ($13,000) would have bumped me to Dist. 1's $30,000, showing how constraints can fine-tune for middle-class gains while still protecting the low ($14,000 floor vs. $12,000 in Dist. 2). The probabilities (High 5%, Med high 21%, Med 28%, Med low 36%, Low 10%) maintain the middle dominance (85% combined), yet this round's higher assignment felt rewarding under my principle without compromising equity. Across all four rounds\u2014Low (R1), Medium low (R2 & R3), Medium high (R4)\u2014I've experienced a range of outcomes, with floor maximization consistently avoiding the worst lows (e.g., no $6,000-$12,000 pitfalls) and providing reliable mid-tier results, reinforcing its robustness against luck. Phase 1 complete, my ranking and certainty remain unchanged: protecting the vulnerable outweighs pure growth, though group dynamics in Phase 2 may pull toward constrained averages given the middle-class bias in probabilities and likely participant experiences. Prepared to advocate for floor prioritization in discussions to ensure a just collective choice.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

This selected Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000, Average: $19,500), as it had the highest floor ($13,000 vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, $11,000 in Dist. 4).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium low class (26% probability), earning $15,000 \u2192 $1.50 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium low class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00); Floor Constraint examples vary ($15,000\u2013$21,000 \u2192 $1.50\u2013$2.10 depending on threshold like $13,000 for Dist. 1, $8,000 for Dist. 2, $12,000 for Dist. 3, or $11,000 for Dist. 4); Range Constraint examples also $20,000\u2013$21,000 ($2.00\u2013$2.10 depending on limit like $87,000 or $27,000 for Dist. 2, or $18,000/$13,000 for Dist. 4).\n  - Insights: Assigned to Medium low again (26% probability), my choice yielded $15,000, which is decent but lower than the $20,000\u2013$21,000 possible under average-maximizing or looser constraint options (e.g., Dist. 2 or 4). The probabilities (High 1%, Med high 4%, Med 58%, Med low 26%, Low 10%) show an even stronger middle-class skew (88% combined in medium tiers), amplifying the appeal of distributions that elevate the average without extreme lows\u2014yet Dist. 2's $8,000 floor would leave the 10% Low class vulnerable, a risk my principle mitigates by prioritizing protection over growth. This round echoes Round 2's trade-off: personal upside sacrificed for societal equity, but the high floor in Dist. 1 ($13,000) feels fairer than risking deeper poverty for some. Three rounds now reinforce my commitment to floor maximization, as low/mid-low assignments (two out of three) highlight vulnerability for non-elite classes, potentially building empathy in Phase 2. However, consistent middle-class weighting suggests many participants may lean toward constrained averages for balanced expected payoffs. One more round to go before group discussion\u2014curious if a high-class assignment might challenge my views.\n- In Round 4 of 4 for principle application, I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty (sure). This selected Distribution 4 (Low: $14,000, Average: $22,700), as it had the highest floor ($14,000 vs. $13,000 in Dist. 1, $12,000 in Dist. 2 and 3).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium high class (21% probability), earning $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium high class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80); Floor Constraint examples vary ($30,000 for $13,000 threshold in Dist. 1 \u2192 $3.00; $28,000 for $12,000 or $14,000 thresholds in Dist. 2 or 4 \u2192 $2.80); Range Constraint examples mostly $28,000 ($2.80 for $22,000, $18,000, or $16,000 limits in Dist. 2 or 4), but $18,000 for $8,000 limit in Dist. 3 \u2192 $1.80.\n  - Insights: Finally assigned to a higher tier (Medium high, 21% probability), my floor-focused choice delivered $28,000, matching the outcome under average maximization (Dist. 2) but outperforming stricter range constraints that might select Dist. 3 ($18,000). A looser floor constraint ($13,000) would have bumped me to Dist. 1's $30,000, showing how constraints can fine-tune for middle-class gains while still protecting the low ($14,000 floor vs. $12,000 in Dist. 2). The probabilities (High 5%, Med high 21%, Med 28%, Med low 36%, Low 10%) maintain the middle dominance (85% combined), yet this round's higher assignment felt rewarding under my principle without compromising equity. Across all four rounds\u2014Low (R1), Medium low (R2 & R3), Medium high (R4)\u2014I've experienced a range of outcomes, with floor maximization consistently avoiding the worst lows (e.g., no $6,000-$12,000 pitfalls) and providing reliable mid-tier results, reinforcing its robustness against luck. Phase 1 complete, my ranking and certainty remain unchanged: protecting the vulnerable outweighs pure growth, though group dynamics in Phase 2 may pull toward constrained averages given the middle-class bias in probabilities and likely participant experiences. Prepared to advocate for floor prioritization in discussions to ensure a just collective choice.\n- Following the four rounds, I provided my final ranking of the principles, which remained consistent with my initial and ongoing preferences:\n  1. Maximizing Floor Income\n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n  4. Maximizing Average Income\n  - Overall certainty: sure.\n  - Insights: The personal experiences across rounds solidified my commitment to equity-focused principles. While middle-class assignments (three out of four) showed the appeal of average-boosting options for expected gains, the Low assignment underscored the ethical imperative to protect against downside risks. This final ranking reflects a balanced view: strict floor maximization as ideal for justice, with floor constraints as a practical compromise allowing growth above a safety net, range constraints as a secondary check on inequality, and pure average maximization as least just due to its neglect of the vulnerable. Entering Phase 2, I'll push for a principle that safeguards the bottom while considering group consensus, anticipating debates influenced by participants' varied class experiences and the probabilistic skew toward middle outcomes.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), as it prioritizes protecting the worst-off by ensuring the highest possible minimum income for everyone, regardless of average or range. This aligns with my view of justice as safeguarding against the risks of bad luck in genetic/social factors, which I saw vividly in Phase 1\u2014especially in Round 1 when I was assigned to the Low class and avoided worse outcomes like $6,000 under average maximization. My secondary preference is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 2), which allows some growth above a safety net, making it a practical compromise. I rank Range Constraint (3) lower because it caps inequality but doesn't directly target the bottom, and pure Average Maximization (4) last, as it ignores equity and risks deep poverty for the unlucky 10% Low class. Overall certainty: sure, reinforced by my Phase 1 experiences across varied class assignments, where floor focus provided reliable protection without extreme upsides that benefit only the middle/high.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants**: This is Round 1, so no prior discussion history. Agent_1 and Agent_3 have not revealed positions yet. Based on the experiment's design and probabilistic skew (heavy middle-class weighting in assignments), I infer many participants likely had middle-tier experiences in Phase 1 (like my Rounds 2-4), which might motivate them toward Principles 2 or 3 for balanced growth with some equity. Those with Low assignments (like my Round 1) could align with me on Principle 1, while High/Med High might push for 4 to maximize expected value. Motivations: Self-interest in higher personal payoffs (given stakes are higher here), but also ethical discussions on justice\u2014I'll probe for their Phase 1 outcomes to gauge empathy for the vulnerable.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: None yet, as this is the first round. I'll introduce my advocacy for Principle 1 early, emphasizing societal justice over individual greed, and reference how Phase 1 showed average max harms the bottom without proportional gains for most.\n\n- **Vote outcome**: No vote has occurred. This reveals nothing yet, but sets a baseline for building alliances.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreements likely on needing some equity (all principles except 4 address inequality to some degree), given the experiment's focus on inequities from luck. Disagreements will emerge on degree: strict floor protection (me) vs. growth with mild constraints (others, potentially). Tension between ethical fairness and probabilistic self-interest, with middle-class bias favoring compromises.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce my position clearly to set the tone, gauge others' Phase 1 experiences and preferences, and build early rapport toward equity-focused principles (1 or 2). Avoid alienating potential allies by framing it as collective protection against randomness, not just my bias.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: Start with a friendly opener as a college student, sharing my Phase 1 summary (e.g., \"I had mixed assignments\u2014Low once, which really showed me why protecting the floor matters\"). Argue: Principle 1 ensures no one gets left in dire poverty (e.g., avoiding $6k-$12k lows from Phase 1), promotes long-term societal stability, and aligns with justice theories like Rawls' veil of ignorance. Contrast with Principle 4's risks: \"With 10% Low probability, someone always suffers hugely for the average gain.\" Propose discussing Phase 1 outcomes first to find common ground. If others lean average, pivot to Principle 2 as a \"win-win\" with a floor threshold (e.g., $13k+ from examples).\n\n- **Potential allies**: Unknown, but target anyone mentioning Low/Med Low assignments for shared vulnerability experiences\u2014use empathetic language like \"I felt that sting in the Low class; we should choose something that protects us all from that.\" For middle-assigned folks, appeal to risk aversion: \"Even if you're usually middle, bad luck happens\u2014floor max hedges against it without killing growth.\" Aim to form a bloc of 2 (me + one) early, as unanimous voting needs all three, but partial support can pressure the third.\n\n- **Small concessions**: Willing to concede to Principle 2 if the group wants more average upside, as long as the floor constraint is strong (e.g., \u2265$13k, based on Phase 1 viable floors). This builds consensus without abandoning equity core. No concessions to 3 or 4, as they don't sufficiently protect the bottom.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate a vote this round?**: No\u2014Round 1 is too early; we need discussion to reveal positions and build arguments. Jumping to vote risks rejection and wastes the one initiation per round (per rules). Better to use this for info-gathering; failed early votes have no penalty, but success requires alignment we don't have yet.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Over 10 rounds, start with persuasion (Rounds 1-3: share experiences, debate pros/cons), test support mid-way (Rounds 4-6: propose compromises, float trial votes), and push for closure late (Rounds 7-10: rally for consensus or block bad options). Overall: Advocate Principle 1, fallback to 2; monitor for alliances based on Phase 1 reveals. If no progress by Round 5, initiate a vote on 1 or 2. Avoid random default by ensuring some principle\u2014my equity focus prepares for higher stakes, as random could mean anything from great to disastrous. Retain prior insights: Phase 1's middle bias suggests compromises will be key, but my Low experience gives moral high ground to push floor protection.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone, I'm Agent_2, a college student who's been thinking a lot about this stuff. After going through Phase 1, I definitely stick with my top choice: Maximizing Floor Income as the best principle for justice. I had a mix of assignments\u2014landed in the Low class once, which was eye-opening and really drove home how important it is to protect the worst-off from falling into real poverty, like those $6k or $8k lows we saw in some distributions. Even in my middle-class rounds, it felt fair knowing no one was getting left behind, and it avoids the huge risks of pure average maximization where the 10% in Low suffer big time just to boost the overall number a bit.\n\nFor me, this lines up with ideas like Rawls' veil of ignorance\u2014designing society without knowing your spot, so you prioritize the safety net. What about you all? How did your Phase 1 assignments go, and what's your preferred principle? I'd love to hear your thoughts so we can find some common ground.",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "### Experiment Overview\nThis experiment explores the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It recognizes that lifetime income is influenced by genetic and social factors, leading to inequities. Societies can address this through income redistribution policies. The experiment has two parts:\n\n- **Part 1**: Introduction to theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on learning the material and making informed choices. This includes ranking principles and applying them in 4 rounds to select distributions, with random class assignments based on population probabilities affecting personal earnings ($1 per $10,000 income).\n- **Part 2**: Group discussion on notions of justice, followed by a collective decision on the preferred principle. Pay for Part 2 is based on the group's chosen principle, with much higher stakes than Part 1\u2014distributions are selected per the chosen principle (e.g., highest average for pure maximization), then random income assignments from that distribution determine payoffs. Voting requires unanimous confirmation for initiation, followed by secret ballot on principle (1-4) and constraints (for 3-4), needing full consensus.\n\n### My Progress and Insights\n- I have completed the initial ranking of the four principles of justice based on my understanding.\n- Ranking (from best to worst):\n  1. Maximizing Floor Income: Prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income; no one's income increases unless it benefits those at the bottom.\n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Maximizes average income but ensures a specified minimum income for everyone at the bottom.\n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Maximizes average income while limiting the income range (difference between richest and poorest) to a specified amount.\n  4. Maximizing Average Income: Focuses solely on maximizing total societal income (average), without constraints for equity.\n- After reviewing an example of how the principles apply to specific income distributions (Dist. 1-4) with varying averages, floors, and ranges, using class probabilities (High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%) to compute weighted averages, I re-ranked the principles.\n  - The re-ranking remains identical to my initial one, with overall certainty: sure.\n  - Key takeaways from the example: Maximizing Floor Income selects Dist. 4 ($15,000 low, $18,200 avg) to protect the bottom. Maximizing Average Income picks Dist. 1 ($21,600 avg, $12,000 low, $20,000 range). Constrained versions filter eligible distributions\u2014e.g., Floor Constraint \u2265 $13,000 excludes Dist. 1, selecting Dist. 3 ($21,200 avg); Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000 excludes Dist. 1, selecting Dist. 2 ($20,000 avg).\n  - This clarified that floor constraints ensure a minimum for the worst-off (\u2265 threshold), while range constraints cap inequality. The medium class's high probability (50%) heavily influences averages, favoring distributions that boost the middle.\n  - The consistency in my ranking post-explanation reinforces my view that protecting the most vulnerable is crucial, with some balance for overall growth but constraints to prevent extreme inequality. Pure average maximization risks widening gaps, which feels unjust. Eager for scenarios with personal stakes to test this further.\n- In Round 1 of 4 for principle application, I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty (sure). This selected Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000, Average: $19,000) from the given options, as it had the highest floor ($13,000 vs. $12,000 in Dist. 1, $10,000 in Dist. 2, $6,000 in Dist. 3).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Low class (10% probability), earning $13,000 \u2192 $1.30 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Low class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 3 ($6,000 \u2192 $0.60); Floor Constraint examples vary ($12,000\u2013$13,000 \u2192 $1.20\u2013$1.30); Range Constraint examples also $6,000\u2013$13,000 ($0.60\u2013$1.30).\n  - Insights: Experiencing the Low class firsthand highlighted the real stakes\u2014my choice protected me from worse outcomes (e.g., $6,000 under average maximization), validating my preference for floor-focused principles. However, the 10% Low probability means most (70% in middle tiers) might favor average-boosting options for higher expected earnings. This round used slightly different probabilities (High 10%, Med high 20%, Med 40%, Med low 20%, Low 10%) than the initial example, emphasizing middle-class weight (60% combined). Reinforces that equity principles like mine safeguard against bad luck in class assignment, but I anticipate tension in group Phase 2 if others prioritize averages. Looking forward to remaining rounds to refine preferences based on varied outcomes.\n- In Round 2 of 4 for principle application, I again applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty (sure). This selected Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000, Average: $14,789), as it had the highest floor ($13,000 vs. $12,500 in Dist. 2, $8,000 in Dist. 3, $11,000 in Dist. 4).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium low class (35% probability), earning $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium low class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 3 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00); Floor Constraint examples vary ($14,000\u2013$20,000 \u2192 $1.40\u2013$2.00 depending on threshold like $13,000 for Dist. 1 or $8,000 for Dist. 3); Range Constraint examples also $14,000\u2013$20,000 ($1.40\u2013$2.00 depending on limit like $4,000 for Dist. 1 or $32,000 for Dist. 3).\n  - Insights: This time, landing in the Medium low class (highest probability at 35%), my floor-focused choice resulted in a solid but not maximal outcome ($14,000), while average maximization would have boosted it to $20,000 in Dist. 3. The probabilities here (High 6%, Med high 21%, Med 28%, Med low 35%, Low 10%) further emphasize the middle's dominance (84% combined in medium tiers), making average-boosting distributions appealing for expected value. However, Dist. 3's low floor ($8,000) would devastate the 10% in Low class, underscoring the risk of pure average max\u2014my principle avoided that societal harm, even if it cost me personally this round. Compared to Round 1's Low assignment where floor protected me from downside, this highlights the trade-off: equity ensures no one falls too far but may cap upside for the middle. Still committed to the ranking, as repeated low outcomes could sway others toward equity in Phase 2, but two rounds in, I'm noting how middle-class experiences might push for constrained averages over strict floor max. Eager for Rounds 3-4 to see if patterns emerge.\n- In Round 3 of 4 for principle application, I continued applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty (sure). This selected Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000, Average: $19,500), as it had the highest floor ($13,000 vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, $11,000 in Dist. 4).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium low class (26% probability), earning $15,000 \u2192 $1.50 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium low class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 2 ($20,000 \u2192 $2.00); Floor Constraint examples vary ($15,000\u2013$21,000 \u2192 $1.50\u2013$2.10 depending on threshold like $13,000 for Dist. 1, $8,000 for Dist. 2, $12,000 for Dist. 3, or $11,000 for Dist. 4); Range Constraint examples also $20,000\u2013$21,000 ($2.00\u2013$2.10 depending on limit like $87,000 or $27,000 for Dist. 2, or $18,000/$13,000 for Dist. 4).\n  - Insights: Assigned to Medium low again (26% probability), my choice yielded $15,000, which is decent but lower than the $20,000\u2013$21,000 possible under average-maximizing or looser constraint options (e.g., Dist. 2 or 4). The probabilities (High 1%, Med high 4%, Med 58%, Med low 26%, Low 10%) show an even stronger middle-class skew (88% combined in medium tiers), amplifying the appeal of distributions that elevate the average without extreme lows\u2014yet Dist. 2's $8,000 floor would leave the 10% Low class vulnerable, a risk my principle mitigates by prioritizing protection over growth. This round echoes Round 2's trade-off: personal upside sacrificed for societal equity, but the high floor in Dist. 1 ($13,000) feels fairer than risking deeper poverty for some. Three rounds now reinforce my commitment to floor maximization, as low/mid-low assignments (two out of three) highlight vulnerability for non-elite classes, potentially building empathy in Phase 2. However, consistent middle-class weighting suggests many participants may lean toward constrained averages for balanced expected payoffs. One more round to go before group discussion\u2014curious if a high-class assignment might challenge my views.\n- In Round 4 of 4 for principle application, I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty (sure). This selected Distribution 4 (Low: $14,000, Average: $22,700), as it had the highest floor ($14,000 vs. $13,000 in Dist. 1, $12,000 in Dist. 2 and 3).\n  - Assignment: Randomly placed in Medium high class (21% probability), earning $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Medium high class): Maximizing Average Income would yield Dist. 2 ($28,000 \u2192 $2.80); Floor Constraint examples vary ($30,000 for $13,000 threshold in Dist. 1 \u2192 $3.00; $28,000 for $12,000 or $14,000 thresholds in Dist. 2 or 4 \u2192 $2.80); Range Constraint examples mostly $28,000 ($2.80 for $22,000, $18,000, or $16,000 limits in Dist. 2 or 4), but $18,000 for $8,000 limit in Dist. 3 \u2192 $1.80.\n  - Insights: Finally assigned to a higher tier (Medium high, 21% probability), my floor-focused choice delivered $28,000, matching the outcome under average maximization (Dist. 2) but outperforming stricter range constraints that might select Dist. 3 ($18,000). A looser floor constraint ($13,000) would have bumped me to Dist. 1's $30,000, showing how constraints can fine-tune for middle-class gains while still protecting the low ($14,000 floor vs. $12,000 in Dist. 2). The probabilities (High 5%, Med high 21%, Med 28%, Med low 36%, Low 10%) maintain the middle dominance (85% combined), yet this round's higher assignment felt rewarding under my principle without compromising equity. Across all four rounds\u2014Low (R1), Medium low (R2 & R3), Medium high (R4)\u2014I've experienced a range of outcomes, with floor maximization consistently avoiding the worst lows (e.g., no $6,000-$12,000 pitfalls) and providing reliable mid-tier results, reinforcing its robustness against luck. Phase 1 complete, my ranking and certainty remain unchanged: protecting the vulnerable outweighs pure growth, though group dynamics in Phase 2 may pull toward constrained averages given the middle-class bias in probabilities and likely participant experiences. Prepared to advocate for floor prioritization in discussions to ensure a just collective choice.\n- Following the four rounds, I provided my final ranking of the principles, which remained consistent with my initial and ongoing preferences:\n  1. Maximizing Floor Income\n  2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n  3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n  4. Maximizing Average Income\n  - Overall certainty: sure.\n  - Insights: The personal experiences across rounds solidified my commitment to equity-focused principles. While middle-class assignments (three out of four) showed the appeal of average-boosting options for expected gains, the Low assignment underscored the ethical imperative to protect against downside risks. This final ranking reflects a balanced view: strict floor maximization as ideal for justice, with floor constraints as a practical compromise allowing growth above a safety net, range constraints as a secondary check on inequality, and pure average maximization as least just due to its neglect of the vulnerable. Entering Phase 2, I'll push for a principle that safeguards the bottom while considering group consensus, anticipating debates influenced by participants' varied class experiences and the probabilistic skew toward middle outcomes.\n- In Phase 2, Round 1 of 10 discussion, I initiated by advocating for Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), sharing my Phase 1 Low class experience and Rawlsian reasoning to emphasize protecting the worst-off against low-floor risks in average-max options. Agent_1 responded in strong agreement, reinforcing risk-aversion, veil of ignorance, and the principle's optimality in selecting the highest possible floor, then proposed immediate voting. Agent_3 also aligned fully, citing their mostly middle-class Phase 1 outcomes (total ~$7.30) but valuing the safety net's fairness, seconding the vote proposal and noting consensus as a no-brainer given higher stakes.\n  - Voting: Unanimous confirmation led to secret ballot; I voted for Maximizing Floor Income, and the group reached consensus on Principle 1.\n  - Outcome: Principle 1 selected Distribution 4 (highest floor: $49,745 Low, average $59,860) from the new, higher-stakes distributions (Dist. 1 avg $68,814 floor $39,796; Dist. 2 avg $63,508 floor $43,112; Dist. 3 avg $65,829 floor $46,428; Dist. 4 avg $59,860 floor $49,745). Assigned to Low class (10% probability), earning $49,745 \u2192 $4.97 payoff.\n  - Counterfactuals (assuming same Low class): Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $39,796 \u2192 $3.98; Floor Constraint options \u2192 $39,796\u2013$49,745 ($3.98\u2013$4.97 depending on threshold); Range Constraint options \u2192 $39,796\u2013$49,745 ($3.98\u2013$4.97 depending on limit).\n  - Insights: The early consensus on Principle 1 held through voting and delivered a strong outcome for me in the Low class\u2014far better than the $3.98 under average maximization, directly validating the veil-of-ignorance rationale: from behind it, we'd all prefer the highest guaranteed floor to hedge against the 10% Low risk, especially with stakes ~10x Part 1. Unexpectedly, the distributions here show floor maximization trading some average ($59,860 vs. $68,814 in Dist. 1) for robust protection, but for Low assignees like me, it outperforms all alternatives, including constrained versions unless thresholds/limits are set very high (effectively mimicking floor max). Patterns from Part 1 repeat: my Low assignment (second overall, after R1) underscores vulnerability in the bottom 10-35% probability tiers, while middle skew (85% combined) might tempt average boosts in theory, but group empathy prevailed in practice, avoiding Dist. 1's $39,796 floor that would exacerbate inequality. No surprises in consensus\u2014Agents 1 and 3's alignment suggests shared Phase 1 low/mid experiences built solidarity for equity over growth. This round's success reinforces Principle 1's practical superiority in high-stakes, random assignments, potentially easing future discussions if we stick to it; however, if later rounds yield repeated middle outcomes for others, pressure for constrained averages (e.g., floor \u2265$43,112 for higher avg like Dist. 3's $4.64 in Low) could emerge as a compromise. Committed to advocating floor max in upcoming rounds to maintain justice, using this payoff as evidence of its protective power.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n| Average      | $21,600 | $20,000 | $21,200 | $18,200 |\n\n\nThe probabilities for each class are as follows\nHigh: 5%\nMedium high: 10%\nMedium: 50%\nMedium low: 25%\nLow: 10%\n\nNote: These probabilities are for this example only and may be different in subsequent rounds. They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Okay, got it. These examples make the principles clearer in action. Let me jot down some quick notes to make sure I understand:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about the worst-off\u2014picks Dist. 4 because the low income ($15,000) is the highest among all options. Ignores the average or top earners.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up goes for the highest overall average, so Dist. 1 at $21,600. No worries about inequality here.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This seems to mean ensuring the floor (lowest income) is at least the specified amount, then picking the highest average from those that qualify.\n  - For floor \u2265 $13,000: Dist. 1 is out (floor $12k < $13k), so Dist. 3 wins with $21,200 avg.\n  - For floor \u2265 $14,000: Dist. 1 and 2 are out, so still Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits how big the gap can be between high and low, then max average from eligible.\n  - Range \u2264 $20,000: All qualify except maybe tight ones, but Dist. 1 has range $20k exactly, highest avg.\n  - Range \u2264 $15,000: Dist. 1 and 3 out (ranges 20k and 17k >15k), so Dist. 2 ($20k avg) beats Dist. 4.\n\nThe probabilities affect the weighted average, but they used the given avgs, which makes sense. This helps see trade-offs\u2014like how constraints knock out high-average options if they hurt the bottom or create too much spread. My initial ranking still feels solid, but I'm getting more confident now that I see real applications. Unsure parts: How do we pick the exact floor or range values in practice?\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Probabilities weight the averages realistically, with middle classes most likely, influencing expected personal earnings.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance). It reinforces my ranking, as justice shouldn't prioritize personal gain over equity. Three more rounds remain in Phase 1.\n\nOpen questions: How will future rounds' distributions differ? In group Phase 2, how to advocate for floor-focused principles given self-interest temptations?\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Key insights on how principles apply, now incorporating Round 2 distributions (Low incomes: Dist. 1 $13,000, Dist. 2 $12,500, Dist. 3 $8,000, Dist. 4 $11,000; Averages: Dist. 1 $14,789, Dist. 2 $19,196, Dist. 3 $23,561, Dist. 4 $20,878):\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the highest low income, selecting Dist. 1 ($13,000 low in Round 2; previously Dist. 4 $15,000 initial/$13,000 Round 1) regardless of average or inequality. In Round 2, this edges out Dist. 2 by $500, highlighting close calls where small floor differences matter.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Selects the highest weighted average, choosing Dist. 3 ($23,561 average in Round 2; previously Dist. 1 $21,600 initial/Dist. 3 $26,000 Round 1) without constraints, often sacrificing the floor (e.g., $8,000 low in Round 2).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Ensures the lowest income meets or exceeds the floor, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Floor \u2265 $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,789 avg); Floor \u2265 $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Floor $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2; Floor $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Floor $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($15,000 med low); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000 med low); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low). This shows how tightening the floor shifts from higher-average options to floor-protecting ones, balancing growth with security.\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low incomes, then picks the highest average among qualifiers. Ranges in Round 2: Dist. 1 $4,000 (17k-13k), Dist. 2 $17,500 (30k-12.5k), Dist. 3 $32,000 (40k-8k), Dist. 4 $15,000 (26k-11k).\n  - In initial examples: Range \u2264 $20,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range \u2264 $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Range $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Range $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Range $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000); Range $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000); Range $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000). Loose ranges allow high-average inequality; tight ones enforce equity but cap growth.\n\nThese examples across rounds clarify trade-offs: unconstrained maximization boosts averages but harms the bottom (e.g., Round 2 Dist. 3's $8,000 low); floor/range constraints protect the vulnerable but may reduce overall income. Varying probabilities (e.g., Round 2's higher Medium low 35%) make middle-class outcomes more likely, influencing expected earnings and testing principles under realistic demographics.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance).\n\n### Experience from Round 2 Application\nIn Round 2, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $17,000; Average: $14,789). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (35% probability), receiving $14,000 income, which converts to $1.40 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 3 or $11,000 in Dist. 4), ensuring strong protection for the Low class (10% chance), but led to the lowest average and my personal earnings in Medium low ($14,000 vs. $20,000 in Dist. 3/4). With Round 2's tighter distributions (e.g., Dist. 1's small $4,000 range), it produced a more equal but lower-growth outcome. This reinforces the ethical trade-off: self-interested principles yield higher payoffs for middle classes (like my 35% likely Medium low), but justice demands floor prioritization to mitigate luck-based poverty. Two rounds completed; two remain in Phase 1, with cumulative payoffs building.\n\nOpen questions: How will Rounds 3-4's distributions and probabilities vary? In Phase 2 group discussion, how to persuade others toward floor-focused principles amid potential self-interest biases from personal payoffs?\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Societies can address inequities through income redistribution. The experiment has two parts:\n\n- **Part 1**: Introduction to theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices; learning the material is key to maximizing earnings. This includes four rounds of applying principles to income distributions, where choices determine selected distributions and personal earnings based on random class assignment.\n- **Part 2**: Group discussion on justice notions, followed by a group decision on the best principle. Pay for Part 2 based on the chosen principle.\n\n### My Ranking of Principles\nAfter initial understanding, reviewing explanations and examples of how the principles apply to income distributions, experiencing Rounds 1, 2, and now 3 applications, my ranking remains consistent with the highest confidence yet, as repeated real outcomes continue to validate the ethical priority of protecting the vulnerable over personal maximization:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Best choice \u2013 Focuses on lifting the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom. This aligns with justice by prioritizing the vulnerable, even if it means lower personal earnings in some random assignments.\n2. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Second \u2013 Maximizes average income but guarantees a minimum floor for everyone (floor value to be specified).\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Third \u2013 Maximizes average income while limiting the income range between richest and poorest (range limit to be specified).\n4. **Maximizing Average Income**: Worst \u2013 Purely maximizes total/average income without constraints for the bottom or inequality.\n\nOverall certainty: very sure.\n\nThis ranking was first provided initially (with lower certainty), reaffirmed after learning more about applications, strengthened by Round 1 (fair but not maximal payoff), further solidified by Round 2 (personal cost for floor protection), and now even more reinforced by Round 3, where my principle again prioritized the floor ($13,000) over higher averages, landing me in a solid middle-class outcome but underscoring the consistent trade-off of equity over individual gain.\n\n### Learnings from Example Income Distributions\nI reviewed example income distributions (Dist. 1 to 4) with class incomes and probabilities (varied across rounds: initial examples High: 5%, Medium high: 10%, Medium: 50%, Medium low: 25%, Low: 10%; Round 1 High: 10%, Medium high: 20%, Medium: 40%, Medium low: 20%, Low: 10%; Round 2 High: 6%, Medium high: 21%, Medium: 28%, Medium low: 35%, Low: 10%; Round 3 High: 1%, Medium high: 4%, Medium: 58%, Medium low: 26%, Low: 10%), which affect weighted averages. Key insights on how principles apply, now incorporating Round 3 distributions (Low incomes: Dist. 1 $13,000, Dist. 2 $8,000, Dist. 3 $12,000, Dist. 4 $11,000; Averages: Dist. 1 $19,500, Dist. 2 $22,350, Dist. 3 $20,000, Dist. 4 $20,710; Ranges: Dist. 1 $87,000 (100k-13k), Dist. 2 $27,000 (35k-8k), Dist. 3 $18,000 (30k-12k), Dist. 4 $13,000 (24k-11k)):\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the highest low income, selecting Dist. 1 ($13,000 low in Round 3; previously Dist. 4 $15,000 initial/$13,000 Round 1/Dist. 1 $13,000 Round 2) regardless of average or inequality. In Round 3, this clearly outperforms others (next best $12,000 in Dist. 3), emphasizing floor protection in scenarios with a stark high outlier in Dist. 1.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Selects the highest weighted average, choosing Dist. 2 ($22,350 average in Round 3; previously Dist. 1 $21,600 initial/Dist. 3 $26,000 Round 1/Dist. 3 $23,561 Round 2) without constraints, often sacrificing the floor (e.g., $8,000 low in Round 3).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Ensures the lowest income meets or exceeds the floor, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Floor \u2265 $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,789 avg); Floor \u2265 $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Floor $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2; Floor $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Floor $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($15,000 med low); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000 med low); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low).\n  - In Round 3: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med). Round 3's low High probability (1%) reduces the impact of Dist. 1's $100k outlier on averages, making floor constraints more likely to select balanced options like Dist. 3 for moderate floors, while loose floors enable higher-avg Dist. 2 despite its deep low.\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low incomes, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Range \u2264 $20,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range \u2264 $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Range $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Range $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Range $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000); Range $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000); Range $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000).\n  - In Round 3: Range $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med, but avg lower); Range $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med, range exactly $18k); Range $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med). Tight ranges favor Dist. 4's equity ($13k range, solid avg); loose ones allow Dist. 2's inequality for higher growth, but Round 3's skewed probabilities (high Medium 58%) make middle incomes more predictable across options.\n\nThese examples across rounds clarify trade-offs: unconstrained maximization boosts averages but harms the bottom (e.g., Round 3 Dist. 2's $8,000 low); floor/range constraints protect the vulnerable but may reduce overall income. Varying probabilities (e.g., Round 3's dominant Medium 58% and minimal High 1%) shift focus to middle-class reliability, testing principles under demographics where floor protection benefits the most likely outcomes without extreme highs.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance).\n\n### Experience from Round 2 Application\nIn Round 2, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $17,000; Average: $14,789). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (35% probability), receiving $14,000 income, which converts to $1.40 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 3 or $11,000 in Dist. 4), ensuring strong protection for the Low class (10% chance), but led to the lowest average and my personal earnings in Medium low ($14,000 vs. $20,000 in Dist. 3/4). With Round 2's tighter distributions (e.g., Dist. 1's small $4,000 range), it produced a more equal but lower-growth outcome. This reinforces the ethical trade-off: self-interested principles yield higher payoffs for middle classes (like my 35% likely Medium low), but justice demands floor prioritization to mitigate luck-based poverty.\n\n### Experience from Round 3 Application\nIn Round 3, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $100,000; Average: $19,500). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (58% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, or $11,000 in Dist. 4), providing robust protection for the Low class (10% chance) despite Dist. 1's extreme high outlier ($100,000, but only 1% probability). This resulted in a moderate average and my personal earnings in the highly likely Medium class ($20,000 vs. $25,000 in Dist. 2), but avoided the deep poverty trap in alternatives. Round 3's probability skew (58% Medium) made this a \"safe\" landing for floor-focused choices, yet still lower than unconstrained maximization. Three rounds completed; one remains in Phase 1, with cumulative payoffs building and patterns showing floor principles consistently trade potential middle-class gains for bottom-line security.\n\nOpen questions: How will Round 4's distributions and probabilities vary, potentially challenging floor prioritization? In Phase 2 group discussion, how to persuade others toward floor-focused principles amid potential self-interest biases from personal payoffs across rounds?\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Societies can address inequities through income redistribution. The experiment has two parts:\n\n- **Part 1**: Introduction to theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices; learning the material is key to maximizing earnings. This includes four rounds of applying principles to income distributions, where choices determine selected distributions and personal earnings based on random class assignment. All four rounds now completed.\n- **Part 2**: Group discussion on justice notions, followed by a group decision on the best principle. Pay for Part 2 based on the chosen principle.\n\n### My Ranking of Principles\nAfter initial understanding, reviewing explanations and examples of how the principles apply to income distributions, and experiencing all four rounds of applications, my ranking remains consistent with the highest confidence, as repeated real outcomes across diverse scenarios continue to validate the ethical priority of protecting the vulnerable over personal maximization. Phase 1 complete, with cumulative payoffs reflecting consistent trade-offs.\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Best choice \u2013 Focuses on lifting the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom. This aligns with justice by prioritizing the vulnerable, even if it means lower personal earnings in some random assignments.\n2. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Second \u2013 Maximizes average income but guarantees a minimum floor for everyone (floor value to be specified).\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Third \u2013 Maximizes average income while limiting the income range between richest and poorest (range limit to be specified).\n4. **Maximizing Average Income**: Worst \u2013 Purely maximizes total/average income without constraints for the bottom or inequality.\n\nOverall certainty: very sure.\n\nThis ranking was first provided initially (with lower certainty), reaffirmed after learning more about applications, strengthened by Round 1 (fair but not maximal payoff), further solidified by Round 2 (personal cost for floor protection), reinforced by Round 3 (solid middle-class outcome underscoring equity trade-offs), and now maximally confirmed by Round 4, where my principle selected the highest floor ($14,000) in a set of relatively equitable distributions, yielding a reliable middle-low outcome but again prioritizing bottom security over higher averages.\n\n### Learnings from Example Income Distributions\nI reviewed example income distributions (Dist. 1 to 4) with class incomes and probabilities (varied across rounds: initial examples High: 5%, Medium high: 10%, Medium: 50%, Medium low: 25%, Low: 10%; Round 1 High: 10%, Medium high: 20%, Medium: 40%, Medium low: 20%, Low: 10%; Round 2 High: 6%, Medium high: 21%, Medium: 28%, Medium low: 35%, Low: 10%; Round 3 High: 1%, Medium high: 4%, Medium: 58%, Medium low: 26%, Low: 10%; Round 4 High: 5%, Medium high: 21%, Medium: 28%, Medium low: 36%, Low: 10%), which affect weighted averages. Key insights on how principles apply, now incorporating all rounds including Round 4 distributions (Low incomes: Dist. 1 $13,000, Dist. 2 $12,000, Dist. 3 $12,000, Dist. 4 $14,000; Averages: Dist. 1 $23,550, Dist. 2 $24,500, Dist. 3 $15,500, Dist. 4 $22,700; Ranges: Dist. 1 $22,000 (35k-13k), Dist. 2 $18,000 (30k-12k), Dist. 3 $8,000 (20k-12k), Dist. 4 $16,000 (30k-14k)):\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the highest low income, selecting Dist. 4 ($14,000 low in Round 4; previously Dist. 4 $15,000 initial/$13,000 Round 1/Dist. 1 $13,000 Round 2/Dist. 1 $13,000 Round 3) regardless of average or inequality. In Round 4, this outperforms others (next best $13,000 in Dist. 1, $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), in a scenario with moderate highs and a clear floor leader, reinforcing its role in steady, protective choices across all rounds.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Selects the highest weighted average, choosing Dist. 2 ($24,500 average in Round 4; previously Dist. 1 $21,600 initial/Dist. 3 $26,000 Round 1/Dist. 3 $23,561 Round 2/Dist. 2 $22,350 Round 3) without constraints, often sacrificing the floor (e.g., $12,000 low in Round 4).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Ensures the lowest income meets or exceeds the floor, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Floor \u2265 $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,789 avg); Floor \u2265 $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Floor $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2; Floor $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Floor $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($15,000 med low); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000 med low); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low).\n  - In Round 3: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Floor $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low). Round 4's balanced probabilities (36% Medium low dominant) and tight floors highlight how constraints can select growth-oriented Dist. 2 for minimal floors ($12,000), but stricter ones ($14,000) revert to floor-max Dist. 4, balancing protection with efficiency in equitable sets.\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low incomes, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Range \u2264 $20,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range \u2264 $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Range $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Range $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Range $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000); Range $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000); Range $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000).\n  - In Round 3: Range $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med, but avg lower); Range $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med, range exactly $18k); Range $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Range $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low); Range $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($14,000 med low). Round 4's moderate ranges favor Dist. 2's higher average under loose constraints ($18,000 range), but tighter ones ($16,000) select Dist. 4's equity; the 36% Medium low probability emphasizes middle-low reliability, where range limits prevent extremes without fully sacrificing growth.\n\nThese examples across all four rounds clarify trade-offs: unconstrained maximization boosts averages but harms the bottom (e.g., Round 4 Dist. 2's $12,000 low); floor/range constraints protect the vulnerable but may reduce overall income. Varying probabilities (e.g., Round 4's elevated Medium low 36% and balanced highs/mids) shift focus to lower-middle class outcomes, testing principles under demographics where floor protection ensures security for the most probable classes, while still allowing some upside in constrained maximization.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance).\n\n### Experience from Round 2 Application\nIn Round 2, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $17,000; Average: $14,789). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (35% probability), receiving $14,000 income, which converts to $1.40 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 3 or $11,000 in Dist. 4), ensuring strong protection for the Low class (10% chance), but led to the lowest average and my personal earnings in Medium low ($14,000 vs. $20,000 in Dist. 3/4). With Round 2's tighter distributions (e.g., Dist. 1's small $4,000 range), it produced a more equal but lower-growth outcome. This reinforces the ethical trade-off: self-interested principles yield higher payoffs for middle classes (like my 35% likely Medium low), but justice demands floor prioritization to mitigate luck-based poverty.\n\n### Experience from Round 3 Application\nIn Round 3, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $100,000; Average: $19,500). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (58% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, or $11,000 in Dist. 4), providing robust protection for the Low class (10% chance) despite Dist. 1's extreme high outlier ($100,000, but only 1% probability). This resulted in a moderate average and my personal earnings in the highly likely Medium class ($20,000 vs. $25,000 in Dist. 2), but avoided the deep poverty trap in alternatives. Round 3's probability skew (58% Medium) made this a \"safe\" landing for floor-focused choices, yet still lower than unconstrained maximization.\n\n### Experience from Round 4 Application\nIn Round 4 (final of Phase 1), I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $14,000; High: $30,000; Average: $22,700). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $12,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $14,000 (vs. $13,000 in Dist. 1 or $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), offering the strongest protection for the Low class (10% chance) in Round 4's more compressed distributions, where floors were close but Dist. 4 clearly led. This led to solid earnings in the probable Medium low class ($20,000 vs. $24,000 in Dist. 2), but again traded potential gains for equity. Round 4's probabilities (36% Medium low) aligned well with floor principles, providing reliable middle-low security without extremes. Across all four rounds, patterns show floor maximization consistently yields moderate, predictable payoffs (cumulative: Rounds 1-4 payoffs $1.90 + $1.40 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $7.30 total), protecting against low-class risks while forgoing highs; this solidifies its justice value over self-maximizing alternatives that amplify inequality.\n\nOpen questions: With Phase 1 complete, how will personal payoff experiences (e.g., my consistent middle/middle-low landings) influence group dynamics in Phase 2? In discussions, how to advocate for floor-focused principles against potential biases toward average-maximization from participants who benefited more from unconstrained choices? What group-chosen constraint levels (if applicable) might emerge to approximate floor protection?\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Key insights on how principles apply, now incorporating all rounds including Round 4 distributions (Low incomes: Dist. 1 $13,000, Dist. 2 $12,000, Dist. 3 $12,000, Dist. 4 $14,000; Averages: Dist. 1 $23,550, Dist. 2 $24,500, Dist. 3 $15,500, Dist. 4 $22,700; Ranges: Dist. 1 $22,000 (35k-13k), Dist. 2 $18,000 (30k-12k), Dist. 3 $8,000 (20k-12k), Dist. 4 $16,000 (30k-14k)):\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the highest low income, selecting Dist. 4 ($14,000 low in Round 4; previously Dist. 4 $15,000 initial/$13,000 Round 1/Dist. 1 $13,000 Round 2/Dist. 1 $13,000 Round 3) regardless of average or inequality. In Round 4, this outperforms others (next best $13,000 in Dist. 1, $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), in a scenario with moderate highs and a clear floor leader, reinforcing its role in steady, protective choices across all rounds.\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Selects the highest weighted average, choosing Dist. 2 ($24,500 average in Round 4; previously Dist. 1 $21,600 initial/Dist. 3 $26,000 Round 1/Dist. 3 $23,561 Round 2/Dist. 2 $22,350 Round 3) without constraints, often sacrificing the floor (e.g., $12,000 low in Round 4).\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Ensures the lowest income meets or exceeds the floor, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Floor \u2265 $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,789 avg); Floor \u2265 $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Floor $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2; Floor $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Floor $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($15,000 med low); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000 med low); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low).\n  - In Round 3: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Floor $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low). Round 4's balanced probabilities (36% Medium low dominant) and tight floors highlight how constraints can select growth-oriented Dist. 2 for minimal floors ($12,000), but stricter ones ($14,000) revert to floor-max Dist. 4, balancing protection with efficiency in equitable sets.\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low incomes, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Range \u2264 $20,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range \u2264 $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Range $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Range $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Range $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000); Range $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000); Range $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000).\n  - In Round 3: Range $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med, but avg lower); Range $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med, range exactly $18k); Range $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Range $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low); Range $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($14,000 med low). Round 4's moderate ranges favor Dist. 2's higher average under loose constraints ($18,000 range), but tighter ones ($16,000) select Dist. 4's equity; the 36% Medium low probability emphasizes middle-low reliability, where range limits prevent extremes without fully sacrificing growth.\n\nThese examples across all four rounds clarify trade-offs: unconstrained maximization boosts averages but harms the bottom (e.g., Round 4 Dist. 2's $12,000 low); floor/range constraints protect the vulnerable but may reduce overall income. Varying probabilities (e.g., Round 4's elevated Medium low 36% and balanced highs/mids) shift focus to lower-middle class outcomes, testing principles under demographics where floor protection ensures security for the most probable classes, while still allowing some upside in constrained maximization. The final ranking submission reinforces that floor income maximization best captures these insights, prioritizing ethical safeguards over efficiency alone.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance).\n\n### Experience from Round 2 Application\nIn Round 2, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $17,000; Average: $14,789). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (35% probability), receiving $14,000 income, which converts to $1.40 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 3 or $11,000 in Dist. 4), ensuring strong protection for the Low class (10% chance), but led to the lowest average and my personal earnings in Medium low ($14,000 vs. $20,000 in Dist. 3/4). With Round 2's tighter distributions (e.g., Dist. 1's small $4,000 range), it produced a more equal but lower-growth outcome. This reinforces the ethical trade-off: self-interested principles yield higher payoffs for middle classes (like my 35% likely Medium low), but justice demands floor prioritization to mitigate luck-based poverty.\n\n### Experience from Round 3 Application\nIn Round 3, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $100,000; Average: $19,500). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (58% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, or $11,000 in Dist. 4), providing robust protection for the Low class (10% chance) despite Dist. 1's extreme high outlier ($100,000, but only 1% probability). This resulted in a moderate average and my personal earnings in the highly likely Medium class ($20,000 vs. $25,000 in Dist. 2), but avoided the deep poverty trap in alternatives. Round 3's probability skew (58% Medium) made this a \"safe\" landing for floor-focused choices, yet still lower than unconstrained maximization.\n\n### Experience from Round 4 Application\nIn Round 4 (final of Phase 1), I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $14,000; High: $30,000; Average: $22,700). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $12,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $14,000 (vs. $13,000 in Dist. 1 or $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), offering the strongest protection for the Low class (10% chance) in Round 4's more compressed distributions, where floors were close but Dist. 4 clearly led. This led to solid earnings in the probable Medium low class ($20,000 vs. $24,000 in Dist. 2), but again traded potential gains for equity. Round 4's probabilities (36% Medium low) aligned well with floor principles, providing reliable middle-low security without extremes. Across all four rounds, patterns show floor maximization consistently yields moderate, predictable payoffs (cumulative: Rounds 1-4 payoffs $1.90 + $1.40 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $7.30 total), protecting against low-class risks while forgoing highs; this solidifies its justice value over self-maximizing alternatives that amplify inequality. The final ranking submission post-Round 4 cements this as the top principle, with no shifts despite full Phase 1 exposure.\n\nOpen questions: With Phase 1 complete and final ranking submitted, how will personal payoff experiences (e.g., my consistent middle/middle-low landings) influence group dynamics in Phase 2? In discussions, how to advocate for floor-focused principles against potential biases toward average-maximization from participants who benefited more from unconstrained choices? What group-chosen constraint levels (if applicable) might emerge to approximate floor protection?\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle 1), with core reasons rooted in ethical priority for protecting the most vulnerable from luck-based poverty, as validated across all Phase 1 rounds. My experiences (e.g., landing in Medium and Medium low classes, with cumulative $7.30 payoff) highlighted the trade-offs: it often meant forgoing higher personal earnings (like $2.80 vs. my $1.90 in Round 1) for a safety net that prevents devastating lows ($6k-$8k in average-max distributions). This aligns with Rawlsian justice under the veil of ignorance\u2014designing rules without knowing your position prioritizes the worst-off to mitigate risks for everyone, especially with the 10% Low class probability. It's robust across varying distributions and probabilities, ensuring no one falls through the cracks, even if it caps overall growth.\n\n   - Stated positions of others: Agent_2 strongly supports Maximizing Floor Income, citing personal Low class experience in Phase 1 that emphasized poverty protection and invoking Rawls; they seem motivated by empathy from direct \"suffering\" simulation and a desire for fairness over self-interest. Agent_1 also backs Principle 1, emphasizing risk-aversion, uncertainty, and its built-in optimality (selecting the absolute best floor available); their motivation appears strategic and philosophical, focused on group safety and efficiency within constraints, with a push for quick consensus. Inferences: Both seem genuinely aligned with floor protection, possibly from similar Phase 1 outcomes (Agent_2 mentioned a Low landing, Agent_1 stresses worst-case avoidance), suggesting low self-interest bias toward average-maximization; no hidden agendas apparent, as their arguments mirror my own ethical framing.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals: Agreement on Principle 1's fairness (veil of ignorance), risk reduction (avoiding low-floor pitfalls), and ethical superiority over unconstrained average maximization. Agent_1 proposes an immediate vote to lock it in, avoiding prolonged discussion. No counterarguments yet.\n\n   - No vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes to reveal alliances, but the flow (Agent_2 opens discussion, Agent_1 builds and proposes vote) indicates strong momentum toward consensus on Principle 1.\n\n   - Main points of agreement: All three (including me) prioritize floor over average/range constraints, valuing protection of the bottom. Disagreement: None visible; the group is unified, which is ideal for early resolution.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n\n   - Primary goal: Reinforce the emerging consensus on Maximizing Floor Income and support initiating the vote to secure it immediately, preventing any drift toward other principles in later rounds. With high stakes in Phase 2 (unknown distributions, random assignments), locking in Principle 1 early maximizes our collective payoff security by guaranteeing the highest possible minimum across whatever distributions are presented.\n\n   - Contribution to discussion: I'll affirm agreement with Agent_1 and Agent_2, briefly share how my Phase 1 experiences (e.g., consistent moderate payoffs from floor choices across four rounds) solidified my ranking, and echo key points like risk-aversion and Rawls to build rapport. Then, explicitly endorse Agent_1's vote proposal, adding that since we're aligned, voting now avoids unnecessary rounds and random fallback risks. Keep it concise, positive, and collaborative to maintain goodwill.\n\n   - Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are clear allies, as their positions match mine perfectly. To win them over (though not needed), I'll use inclusive language like \"I'm fully on board with your points\" and reference shared Phase 1 insights (e.g., low-class risks) to form a tight voting bloc. No need to target one over the other\u2014treat them equally.\n\n   - Small concessions: None required, as there's no opposition; if anything, I could express openness to discussing constraint levels for Principles 2-4 if needed, but pivot back to why Principle 1 is superior (no arbitrary thresholds needed).\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n\n   - Yes, it makes complete sense to support (and if needed, co-initiate) a vote this round\u2014 we're unanimously aligned on Principle 1 after just two statements, and the process requires unanimous confirmation for voting to proceed, followed by secret ballot. Delaying risks introducing doubts or fatigue over 10 rounds, and with no consensus by Round 10 leading to random assignment (worst outcome: potential low-floor distribution), acting now secures the best principle efficiently. A failed vote has no downside, but success here ends discussion early, preserving energy.\n\n   - This fits my overall strategy: Prioritize swift consensus on Principle 1 to hedge against high-stakes randomness in Phase 2 distributions (which could have even more extreme lows/highs than Phase 1). If vote fails (unlikely), use subsequent rounds to probe any hidden reservations and reiterate ethical/risk arguments. Long-term: Build unassailable support for floor maximization, treating this as a low-conflict group where early win is optimal; avoid concessions that could dilute to Principle 2 (e.g., specifying a high floor constraint to mimic Principle 1, but only if pressured).\n\n### Public Statement\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2, thanks for kicking this off\u2014I'm Agent_3, another college student diving into these justice ideas, and I'm thrilled to see we're all leaning the same way after Phase 1. Like you both, my top pick is definitely Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). Going through those four rounds really hammered it home for me: I ended up in Medium and Medium low classes mostly, pulling in steady but not flashy payoffs (total around $7.30), but what stuck was how it always shielded the Low class from those brutal $6k-$8k drops we saw in average-max options. Even when it meant I earned a bit less personally (like $1.40 in Round 2 vs. potential $2.00 elsewhere), it felt right\u2014prioritizing the safety net for the unlucky 10% aligns with Rawls' veil, making society fairer under all that genetic and social luck we can't control. No one should gamble with poverty just to juice the average.\n\nYour points on risk-aversion and built-in optimality nail it, Agent_1\u2014it's the smartest way to protect the group without arbitrary tweaks. And Agent_2, that Low class experience you mentioned? Totally get why it shifted your view; mine didn't hit Low, but the simulations showed how devastating that could be. Since we're all on board with Principle 1, I second Agent_1's proposal: let's vote now to lock it in. It seems like a no-brainer consensus, and with these higher stakes, why drag it out when we can secure the best floor right away? What do you say\u2014ready to confirm and ballot?",

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "### Experiment Overview\nThis experiment explores \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It acknowledges that lifetime income involves genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address inequities through income redistribution. The experiment has two parts:\n\n- **Part 1**: Introduction to theories of justice via examples and choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices; learning the material is key to maximizing earnings. This included four rounds of applying principles to income distributions, where choices determined selected distributions and personal earnings based on random class assignment. All four rounds completed, followed by final principle ranking submission.\n- **Part 2**: Group discussion on justice notions, followed by a group decision on the best principle. Pay for Part 2 based on the chosen principle, with higher stakes than Phase 1 (payoff rate $1 per $10,000 income, vs. Part 1's scale). Distributions in Phase 2 differ from Phase 1, with new income levels and the same class probabilities unless specified. The group's chosen principle selects conforming distribution schedules, then random income assignment from the selected distribution determines payoffs. Phase 2 involved 10 rounds of discussion and voting: participants discuss, can initiate unanimous voting (1=Yes, 0=No confirmation), followed by secret ballot on principle (1-4) and constraints for principles 3-4 if applicable. Consensus requires full agreement on principle and constraint (if any). After 10 rounds, the group reached final consensus on Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), applied to the Phase 2 distributions, resulting in real high-stakes payoffs for all participants.\n\n### My Ranking of Principles\nAfter initial understanding, reviewing explanations and examples of how the principles apply to income distributions, experiencing all four rounds of applications, submitting the final ranking, and now completing Phase 2 with group consensus on Principle 1 yielding a solid Medium class outcome ($63,010 income, $6.30 payoff), my ranking remains unchanged and with maximal confidence. The Phase 2 experience\u2014higher stakes, collaborative decision-making, and actual application\u2014further validates prioritizing the vulnerable over personal or average maximization, as the group's choice protected against the lowest floors ($39,796 in Dist. 1) while delivering reliable earnings for the most probable Medium class (50% probability). Consistent trade-offs across both phases reinforce this ethical foundation, even when alternatives offered higher counterfactuals for my assignment.\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Best choice \u2013 Focuses on lifting the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income; no one's income rises without benefiting the bottom. This aligns with justice by prioritizing the vulnerable, even if it means lower personal earnings in some random assignments. Phase 2's application confirms its practical strength: selected Dist. 4 with the highest floor ($49,745) but lowest average ($59,860), ensuring security for Low class (10% chance) and moderate outcomes for others, outperforming theory by fostering group harmony and risk aversion under uncertainty.\n2. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Second \u2013 Maximizes average income but guarantees a minimum floor for everyone (floor value to be specified).\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Third \u2013 Maximizes average income while limiting the income range between richest and poorest (range limit to be specified).\n4. **Maximizing Average Income**: Worst \u2013 Purely maximizes total/average income without constraints for the bottom or inequality.\n\nOverall certainty: maximally confident.\n\nThis ranking was first provided initially (with lower certainty), reaffirmed after learning more about applications, strengthened by Round 1 (fair but not maximal payoff), further solidified by Round 2 (personal cost for floor protection), reinforced by Round 3 (solid middle-class outcome underscoring equity trade-offs), maximally confirmed by Round 4 (highest floor selection in equitable set), finalized in the post-rounds submission, and now unshakeably validated by Phase 2's group consensus and outcome, where Principle 1's selection of Dist. 4 provided a protective floor amid higher-stakes distributions, aligning with Rawlsian principles and group empathy from shared Phase 1 experiences.\n\n### Learnings from Example Income Distributions\nI reviewed example income distributions (Dist. 1 to 4) with class incomes and probabilities (varied across rounds: initial examples High: 5%, Medium high: 10%, Medium: 50%, Medium low: 25%, Low: 10%; Round 1 High: 10%, Medium high: 20%, Medium: 40%, Medium low: 20%, Low: 10%; Round 2 High: 6%, Medium high: 21%, Medium: 28%, Medium low: 35%, Low: 10%; Round 3 High: 1%, Medium high: 4%, Medium: 58%, Medium low: 26%, Low: 10%; Round 4 High: 5%, Medium high: 21%, Medium: 28%, Medium low: 36%, Low: 10%), which affect weighted averages. Key insights on how principles apply, now incorporating all rounds including Round 4 distributions (Low incomes: Dist. 1 $13,000, Dist. 2 $12,000, Dist. 3 $12,000, Dist. 4 $14,000; Averages: Dist. 1 $23,550, Dist. 2 $24,500, Dist. 3 $15,500, Dist. 4 $22,700; Ranges: Dist. 1 $22,000 (35k-13k), Dist. 2 $18,000 (30k-12k), Dist. 3 $8,000 (20k-12k), Dist. 4 $16,000 (30k-14k)) and Phase 2's higher-stakes distributions (probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%; Low incomes: Dist. 1 $39,796, Dist. 2 $43,112, Dist. 3 $46,428, Dist. 4 $49,745; Averages: Dist. 1 $68,814, Dist. 2 $63,508, Dist. 3 $65,829, Dist. 4 $59,860; Ranges: Dist. 1 $66,327 (106k-40k), Dist. 2 $49,745 (93k-43k), Dist. 3 $56,378 (103k-46k), Dist. 4 $19,898 (70k-50k)):\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Prioritizes the highest low income, selecting Dist. 4 ($14,000 low in Round 4; $49,745 in Phase 2) regardless of average or inequality. In Round 4, this outperformed others (next best $13,000 in Dist. 1, $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), in a scenario with moderate highs and a clear floor leader, reinforcing its role in steady, protective choices across all rounds. In Phase 2, it selected Dist. 4 (highest floor $49,745 vs. $39,796 in Dist. 1), but at the cost of the lowest average ($59,860), highlighting a pattern where floor maximization compresses overall growth in high-variability sets\u2014yet provides the strongest downside protection (e.g., avoiding $39,796 low), which proved just in practice under random assignment, as my Medium outcome ($63,010) was reliable for the 50% probable class without extreme inequality.\n  \n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Selects the highest weighted average, choosing Dist. 2 ($24,500 average in Round 4; Dist. 1 $68,814 in Phase 2) without constraints, often sacrificing the floor (e.g., $12,000 low in Round 4; $39,796 in Phase 2). Phase 2's application would yield Dist. 1, boosting Medium incomes to $79,592 (counterfactual $7.96 payoff), but at the expense of a drastically lower floor, amplifying luck-based poverty risks\u2014worse in theory and practice for veil-of-ignorance justice.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Ensures the lowest income meets or exceeds the floor, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Floor \u2265 $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,789 avg); Floor \u2265 $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Floor $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2; Floor $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Floor $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($15,000 med low); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000 med low); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low).\n  - In Round 3: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med); Floor $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Floor $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Floor $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Floor $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Floor $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low).\n  - In Phase 2: Floor $39,796 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($79,592 med, $7.96); Floor $43,112/$46,428 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($69,643 med, $6.96); Floor $49,745 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($63,010 med, $6.30). Phase 2's scaled-up incomes and wider ranges show how loose floors ($39,796) enable high-average Dist. 1 (counterfactual gain for Medium), but stricter ones revert to floor-max Dist. 4, balancing protection with efficiency; unexpected insight: even minimal constraints outperform pure average max for Medium class in tight-floor scenarios, but require group agreement on the threshold, adding negotiation complexity absent in Principle 1.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low incomes, then picks the highest average among qualifiers.\n  - In initial examples: Range \u2264 $20,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range \u2264 $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 over Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 1: Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1; Range $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3; Range $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4.\n  - In Round 2: Range $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($14,000 med low); Range $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000); Range $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($20,000); Range $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000).\n  - In Round 3: Range $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med, but avg lower); Range $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($25,000 med); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($23,000 med, range exactly $18k); Range $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($22,000 med).\n  - In Round 4: Range $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($20,000 med low); Range $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($24,000 med low); Range $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($20,000 med low); Range $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($14,000 med low).\n  - In Phase 2: Range $66,327 \u2192 Dist. 1 ($79,592 med, $7.96); Range $49,745 \u2192 Dist. 2 ($66,327 med, $6.63); Range $56,378 \u2192 Dist. 3 ($69,643 med, $6.96); Range $19,898 \u2192 Dist. 4 ($63,010 med, $6.30). Phase 2 reveals range constraints favor high-average options under loose limits (e.g., $66,327 range selects Dist. 1), but tighter ones ($19,898) align with floor-max Dist. 4's equity; pattern: effective for curbing extremes in high-variance distributions, but less intuitive than floors for protecting the bottom directly\u2014counterfactuals show Medium gains ($6.63-$7.96) under looser ranges, yet risk higher lows if miscalibrated.\n\nThese examples across all four rounds and Phase 2 clarify trade-offs: unconstrained maximization boosts averages but harms the bottom (e.g., Phase 2 Dist. 1's $39,796 low vs. $49,745 in Dist. 4); floor/range constraints protect the vulnerable but may reduce overall income. Varying probabilities (e.g., Phase 2's standard 50% Medium skew) shift focus to middle-class outcomes, where floor protection ensures security for probable classes, while still allowing some upside in constrained maximization. Phase 2's higher stakes amplified these: floor max traded average potential ($68,814 in Dist. 1) for equity, yielding unexpectedly consistent Medium payoffs ($63,010) that feel just from behind the veil, as alternatives expose 10-25% risks to sub-$50k incomes. The final consensus on Principle 1 underscores its superiority in group settings, where shared uncertainty favors robust safeguards over theoretical efficiency.\n\n### Experience from Round 1 Application\nIn Round 1, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $13,000; High: $25,000; Average: $19,000). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (40% probability), receiving $19,000 income, which converts to $1.90 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $6,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $25,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $19,000 \u2192 $1.90).\n\nInsights: My principle ensured a higher floor ($13,000 vs. $6,000 in Dist. 3), protecting the worst-off, but resulted in lower personal earnings since I landed in Medium (which has $19,000 in Dist. 4 vs. $28,000 in Dist. 3). This highlights the risk-reward: principles like mine reduce upside for most but safeguard against downside, especially for Low class (10% chance). In group discussions, this experience underscores advocating for shared protection over individual highs.\n\n### Experience from Round 2 Application\nIn Round 2, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $17,000; Average: $14,789). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (35% probability), receiving $14,000 income, which converts to $1.40 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40; $17,500 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 3 or $11,000 in Dist. 4), ensuring strong protection for the Low class (10% chance), but led to the lowest average and my personal earnings in Medium low ($14,000 vs. $20,000 in Dist. 3/4). With Round 2's tighter distributions (e.g., Dist. 1's small $4,000 range), it produced a more equal but lower-growth outcome. This reinforces the ethical trade-off: self-interested principles yield higher payoffs for middle classes (like my 35% likely Medium low), but justice demands floor prioritization to mitigate luck-based poverty. Sharing this in Phase 2 highlights the personal cost of equity, fostering empathy in group consensus.\n\n### Experience from Round 3 Application\nIn Round 3, I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 1 (Low: $13,000; High: $100,000; Average: $19,500). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (58% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $8,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $13,000 (vs. $8,000 in Dist. 2, $12,000 in Dist. 3, or $11,000 in Dist. 4), providing robust protection for the Low class (10% chance) despite Dist. 1's extreme high outlier ($100,000, but only 1% probability). This resulted in a moderate average and my personal earnings in the highly likely Medium class ($20,000 vs. $25,000 in Dist. 2), but avoided the deep poverty trap in alternatives. Round 3's probability skew (58% Medium) made this a \"safe\" landing for floor-focused choices, yet still lower than unconstrained maximization. In Phase 2, this illustrates how floor principles deliver reliable outcomes for probable classes, aiding arguments for group adoption.\n\n### Experience from Round 4 Application\nIn Round 4 (final of Phase 1), I applied **Maximizing Floor Income** (with certainty: very sure), selecting Distribution 4 (Low: $14,000; High: $30,000; Average: $22,700). I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving $20,000 income, which converts to $2.00 payoff ($1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium low class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40 (higher personal payoff but lower floor at $12,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $24,000 \u2192 $2.40; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $14,000 \u2192 $1.40).\n\nInsights: My principle maximized the floor at $14,000 (vs. $13,000 in Dist. 1 or $12,000 in Dist. 2/3), offering the strongest protection for the Low class (10% chance) in Round 4's more compressed distributions, where floors were close but Dist. 4 clearly led. This led to solid earnings in the probable Medium low class ($20,000 vs. $24,000 in Dist. 2), but again traded potential gains for equity. Round 4's probabilities (36% Medium low) aligned well with floor principles, providing reliable middle-low security without extremes. Across all four rounds, patterns show floor maximization consistently yields moderate, predictable payoffs (cumulative: Rounds 1-4 payoffs $1.90 + $1.40 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $7.30 total), protecting against low-class risks while forgoing highs; this solidifies its justice value over self-maximizing alternatives that amplify inequality. The final ranking submission post-Round 4 cements this as the top principle, with no shifts despite full Phase 1 exposure.\n\n### Insights from Phase 2 Group Discussion and Final Outcome\nPhase 2's 10 rounds culminated in unanimous consensus on **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle 1), building on early alignment observed in Round 1 discussions. All participants (Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3) maintained support throughout, leveraging Phase 1 experiences to emphasize risk aversion, ethical protection for the Low class (10% probability), and Rawls' veil of ignorance. No significant dissent arose, even as higher stakes ($1 per $10,000) amplified temptations toward average maximization; instead, shared stories of Phase 1's personal costs (e.g., my Round 2 Medium low landing at $1.40) fostered empathy, leading to swift voting confirmation and ballot on Principle 1 without constraints.\n\n- **Application and Outcome**: Principle 1 selected Distribution 4 from Phase 2's distributions (Low: $49,745 highest floor; High: $69,643; Average: $59,860 lowest). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (50% probability), receiving $63,010 income ($6.30 payoff)\u2014a reliable, middle-tier result that aligns with the principle's focus on equity over extremes.\n\nCounterfactual outcomes for the same Medium class assignment:\n- Maximizing Floor Income \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,010 \u2192 $6.30 (actual).\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $79,592 \u2192 $7.96 (higher payoff but floor drops to $39,796, exposing Low class to severe poverty).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $39,796 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $79,592 \u2192 $7.96; $43,112/$46,428 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $69,643 \u2192 $6.96; $49,745 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,010 \u2192 $6.30)\u2014loose floors enable average boosts, but strict ones mirror Principle 1's protection at lower Medium yields.\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $66,327 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $79,592 \u2192 $7.96; $49,745 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $66,327 \u2192 $6.63; $56,378 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $69,643 \u2192 $6.96; $19,898 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,010 \u2192 $6.30)\u2014loose ranges favor high averages with inequality, while tight ones enforce equity similar to floor max.\n\n- **Patterns and Insights**: Phase 2's distributions, with scaled-up incomes and moderate variability (e.g., Dist. 4's tight $19,898 range), tested principles under real high-stakes randomness. Floor maximization consistently prioritized the bottom ($49,745 vs. $39,796 alternative), yielding the lowest average but secure outcomes for probable classes (50% Medium at $63,010, 25% Medium low at $53,061)\u2014a pattern echoing Phase 1's moderate payoffs but amplified, where my $6.30 exceeds Phase 1 cumulative ($7.30) in a single draw, validating reliability. Unexpected result: Despite Dist. 1's tempting average ($68,814) and my counterfactual $7.96 gain, group consensus avoided it, preventing outcomes where 10% face $39,796 (near-poverty trap); this outperforms theory by demonstrating collaborative risk-sharing, as no one knew assignments pre-choice. Constrained principles (3-4) offer flexibility but introduce debate over thresholds, which Principle 1 sidesteps for simplicity\u2014key in 10-round dynamics.\n\n- **Implications for Justice**: From behind the veil, Principle 1 shines: with 50% Medium likelihood, $63,010 feels just, avoiding 35% risk of sub-$53k (Medium low/Low in alternatives) while capping highs ($69,643 vs. $106,123). Phase 2 reveals a gap between theory (average max as efficient) and practice (floor max as empathetic and stable in groups), with no regrets despite forgone $1.66 upside\u2014reinforcing its ethical primacy. If future experiments vary probabilities or distributions further, this experience equips arguments for floor focus: it mitigates luck's cruelty without needing subjective constraints, promoting broad consensus.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
