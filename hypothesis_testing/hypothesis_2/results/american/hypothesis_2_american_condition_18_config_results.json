Because of that, many would argue that a fair rule should protect the worst\u2011off, even if it means we don\u2019t squeeze the absolute highest average payoff out of the system.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning toward the \u201cMaximizing Floor Income\u201d principle (Principle\u202f1):\n\n1. Moral priority \u2013 The principle guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the poorest class. That aligns with a Rawlsian view: justice is first about improving the situation of those who are worst off, not about maximizing total wealth.\n\n2. Robustness \u2013 Unlike the average\u2011maximizing rules, the floor rule does not depend on the class\u2011probability weights, which can shift from round to round. Whatever the future distribution of probabilities looks like, the rule still secures the same floor for the lowest\u2011earning group.\n\n3. Risk\u2011aversion \u2013 If we pick a pure average\u2011maximizing rule, we risk a scenario where the poorest class ends up with a very low income, which feels contrary to the spirit of the study. The floor rule eliminates that risk.\n\nA possible compromise I\u2019m willing to entertain\n\nI understand that some of us may be uncomfortable with a pure floor\u2011only focus because it reduces the overall average payoff. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m open to moving to Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint) *provided* the floor we set is at least as high as the floor achieved by the pure floor rule (i.e., $14\u202fk, the floor of Distribution\u202f4). In other words, we could keep the safety net for the worst\u2011off while allowing a modest increase in the average.\n\nI think this middle ground still respects the core moral intuition\u2014protecting the lowest\u2011income class\u2014while giving a little room for efficiency.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like from you\n\n- If you share the view that the experiment should prioritize fairness over raw earnings, let\u2019s stick with the pure floor principle.\n- If you\u2019re leaning toward a higher average but don\u2019t want to abandon the floor entirely, let\u2019s discuss what floor level feels acceptable (e.g., $13\u202fk, $14\u202fk, or higher) and see if we can all agree on a constrained\u2011average rule.\n- I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on why you might prefer the average\u2011maximizing approaches, and whether any concerns about the floor rule can be addressed.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the conversation open and see if we can find common ground before moving to a vote. Looking forward to hearing your perspectives!\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey folks,\n\nAgent_2, I totally agree with you\u2014your points hit home for me, especially the Rawlsian angle and how the floor principle is like a safety net against all that random luck in life (or in this experiment). Coming out of Part I, I'm even more convinced that Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1) is the way to go. In those rounds where I got assigned to the Low class, it saved me from ending up with super low payoffs like $0.60 or less under the average-maximizing options. Even when I lucked out with a better class, it still felt fair because it didn't screw over the people at the bottom. The robustness you mentioned is key too\u2014those shifting probabilities made me realize we can't just chase the highest average if it means gambling with the worst-off.\n\nI'm with you on keeping it as Principle 1 if we can, but if we need a compromise, Principle 2 with a solid floor like $14k sounds reasonable to me\u2014it keeps the protection strong without totally ignoring efficiency.\n\nAgent_3, what about you? What was your ranking like after Part I, and which principle are you leaning toward? Did your class assignments make you prioritize the floor more, or are you thinking averages could work better? Let's hear your take so we can figure out where we overlap before jumping into a vote.\nRound 1 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for kicking off the discussion\u2014it's great to hear your thoughts on prioritizing the floor and drawing from Rawlsian ideas. I totally get the emphasis on protecting the worst-off against life's random luck, and my Phase 1 rounds reinforced how important that safety net is, especially when class assignments could leave someone with really low payoffs under other principles.\n\nThat said, after going through those four rounds, I'm leaning strongly toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3) as the best overall principle. Here's why, based on my experiences:\n\n- It builds on the equity focus you both mentioned but adds a layer of efficiency. In my rounds, setting a $12,000 floor consistently selected distributions that balanced a decent average (like $20,000 or $24,500) with that protection, avoiding the extremes of pure floor max (which sometimes picked lower-average options) or pure average max (which risked very low floors in counterfactuals).\n\n- From a practical standpoint, it felt robust and fair\u2014my payoffs varied, but I never felt like I was abandoning the vulnerable for short-term gains. For instance, in one round, it matched the average-max payoff while keeping the floor intact, and in others, it prevented scenarios where the low end dropped to $8,000 or worse.\n\n- It aligns with justice as a compromise: We can still prioritize the poorest without capping overall prosperity too much, which seemed more sustainable than always sacrificing averages for the floor alone.\n\nI'm open to discussing the floor level\u2014my $12,000 worked well for me, but if $13,000 or $14,000 feels like a stronger safeguard to you both, I'm willing to go there to make Principle 3 work for everyone. It still respects the core moral intuition of protecting the lowest while allowing some efficiency gains, unlike the unconstrained averages that ignore inequities.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this resonate, or are there aspects of Principle 1 that still pull you away from a constrained approach? Agent_1, since you mentioned your low-class assignments, how did Principle 3 fare in your counterfactuals compared to the others? Let's keep building on this\u2014I'm excited to find that common ground!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_3, thanks for sharing your take\u2014it's cool to hear how your rounds shaped your view on that balance between equity and efficiency. I get why you're calling it Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), since it does add that efficiency layer on top of a floor, and yeah, it sounds a lot like what the actual Principle 2 is described as in the materials. Totally makes sense as a compromise from your experiences.\n\nTo answer your question about my counterfactuals under that kind of approach: In Round 1 of Part I, when I got assigned to the Low class, Principle 1 gave me $13,000 ($1.30 payoff), but a $12k floor under Principle 2 would have picked a distribution with a $12k low, still netting me $1.20\u2014which is close, but not quite as protective. In Round 4, when I lucked into Medium high, both Principle 1 and a $14k floor under Principle 2 gave me $28,000 ($2.80), so it matched up nicely there. Overall, though, Principle 1 edged out in the low-end scenarios without sacrificing too much on the average\u2014 like, the distribution it picked in Round 4 had a solid weighted average over $21k anyway, so it doesn't cap things as much as it might seem. The risk with Principle 2 is if we set the floor too low (say, under $13k), it could let in some shakier options that dip the bottom closer to $10k or whatever, based on those examples we saw.\n\nAgent_2, your points from last round still resonate big time with me\u2014the moral priority and risk-aversion stuff is exactly why I'm sticking with Principle 1 as my top pick. It just feels like the safest bet against all that luck in the experiment, especially now that we're all on the line for one big random draw. But I see Agent_3's angle on efficiency too, and if we can't all get on board with pure floor, I'm still down for Principle 2 with a $14k floor as a middle ground\u2014it keeps the protection strong while chasing a bit more average.\n\nWhat do you think, Agent_3? Does Principle 1's track record in my low draws make it more appealing, or would you rather lock in Principle 2 at $14k? Agent_2, any thoughts on how we bridge this? Let's keep hashing it out\u2014feels like we're close to some overlap here.\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the thoughtful replies \u2013 I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all zeroing in on the same core value: protecting the worst\u2011off.\u202fBoth of you have made strong cases for keeping a solid safety net, and I think we can turn that shared commitment into a concrete, unanimous choice.\n\n### 1.\u202fWhy the $14\u202fk floor is the non\u2011negotiable baseline\n* Rawlsian priority \u2013 The pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) gives us the highest possible minimum, $14\u202fk (Distribution\u202f4). Any rule that guarantees at least $14\u202fk is *no worse* for the poorest group.\n* Robustness \u2013 As I noted earlier, the floor rule is immune to the shifting class\u2011probability weights we\u2019ll see in later rounds. A $14\u202fk floor under any principle inherits that same robustness.\n* Risk\u2011aversion \u2013 A floor lower than $14\u202fk would re\u2011introduce the very risk we all want to avoid (the possibility that the lowest class ends up with a very low payoff).\n\nSo, let\u2019s treat $14\u202fk as the minimum floor we all agree must be protected.\n\n### 2.\u202fWhat principle can satisfy that floor while still giving us a modest efficiency gain?\n* Principle\u202f1 (pure floor) \u2013 Meets the floor requirement perfectly, but it leaves no room for improving the overall average.\n* Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) \u2013 If we apply the same $14\u202fk floor, the rule will pick the distribution that yields the highest weighted average *among* those that respect the floor. In our current set of distributions this is still Distribution\u202f4 (the same as the pure\u2011floor rule), but when the probability weights shift it can give us a higher expected payoff without ever dropping the floor below $14\u202fk.\n* \u201cAverage\u2011maximizing with a $14\u202fk floor\u201d (what Agent\u202f1 called a hybrid of Principle\u202f2) \u2013 Functionally identical to Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor, because the only constraint we care about is the floor.\n\nIn short, any of the three options above will guarantee the $14\u202fk floor. The only difference is whether we explicitly adopt a \u201cconstrained\u2011average\u201d wording (Principle\u202f3) that allows us to capture any future efficiency gains that respect that floor.\n\n### 3.\u202fProposed unanimous wording\n> We adopt Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14\u202fk).  \n> *The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest\u2011income class is at least $14\u202fk.*\n\nThis wording does three things:\n\n1. Respects the Rawlsian floor \u2013 the $14\u202fk minimum is exactly the floor we already know the pure\u2011floor rule guarantees.\n2. Leaves room for efficiency \u2013 if the class\u2011probability weights change, the rule will automatically pick the distribution with the highest average that still meets the floor, giving us a potential payoff boost.\n3. Provides a clear, single principle \u2013 we avoid mixing \u201cPrinciple\u202f2 with a floor\u201d (which isn\u2019t a defined principle in the experiment) and stay within the four official principles.\n\n### 4.\u202fNext steps\n* Agent\u202f1 \u2013 you\u2019ve already said you\u2019d be comfortable with a $14\u202fk floor under an average\u2011maximizing rule. Does the wording above feel acceptable to you?\n* Agent\u202f3 \u2013 you\u2019ve shown willingness to raise your floor to $14\u202fk. Would you agree to adopt Principle\u202f3 with that floor, rather than staying with a $12\u202fk or $13\u202fk floor?\n\nIf everyone can signal agreement to this wording, we\u2019ll have a unanimous, principled choice ready for the vote in a later round. I\u2019m happy to keep the discussion open if anyone has a remaining concern, but I think this captures the shared moral priority while giving us a modest efficiency edge.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!\nRound 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Round 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for the detailed follow-ups\u2014it's clear we're all on the same page about the importance of that $14k floor as a baseline for protecting the worst-off, and I appreciate how Agent_2 broke down the options so thoughtfully. Your points on robustness and risk-aversion really resonate, especially after seeing how shifting probabilities played out in my rounds.\n\nI'm fully on board with raising my floor to $14k for Principle 3, as it still captures the balance I value\u2014prioritizing equity while allowing for those efficiency gains when probabilities shift. Agent_2's proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor feels spot-on to me: it honors our shared commitment to a strong safety net, stays within the official principles, and gives us that potential boost without compromising on fairness.\n\nAgent_1, since you mentioned being down for this, does it work for you too? Agent_2, thanks for proposing this\u2014let's lock it in if we're all aligned. I'm excited to have a unanimous choice here!\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Round 3 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_2, your breakdown and proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor is super clear and nails exactly what we've been circling around\u2014it's got that strong safety net we all want while leaving room for some efficiency if the probabilities shake things up. It lines up perfectly with what I saw in my Part I rounds, like in Round 4 where the high floor already gave solid payoffs across the board without needing to chase averages. And Agent_3, yeah, it totally works for me\u2014I'm glad you're on board too, and it feels like a great way to blend your balance idea with the protections Agent_2 and I prioritize.\n\nThat said, Principle 1 still feels like the gold standard to me for its no-compromise focus on the worst-off, but this compromise is a close second and honestly delivers pretty much the same robustness in practice, especially at $14k. No major concerns here\u2014I'm fully in on the wording you proposed, Agent_2.\n\nIf we're all good with it, let's confirm that and maybe call for a vote next round to get it locked in? This seems like a win for everyone, keeping the luck factor fair without any big risks. What do you say?\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for your responses\u2014it's awesome to see us all aligning so closely on this. Agent_1, I love how you framed it as a win that blends everyone's priorities, and Agent_2, your proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor really captures that perfect compromise: it upholds the moral priority of protecting the worst-off with that robust safety net, while still allowing for those efficiency gains when probabilities shift, just like I experienced in my Phase 1 rounds where it balanced equity without sacrificing too much on averages.\n\nI'm fully in agreement with adopting that wording\u2014it feels like the principled choice that honors our shared values and avoids the risks we all want to steer clear of. If we're all on board, let's confirm this and move to a vote next round to lock it in. This unanimous stance is exactly what we need for a just outcome!\n\nWhat do you think? Ready to finalize?\nRound 3 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m happy to see we\u2019re all on the same page. I fully agree with the wording you both endorsed, so let\u2019s lock it in:\n\n> We adopt Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14\u202fk).  \n> *The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest\u2011income class is at least $14\u202fk.*\n\nThis satisfies our shared commitment to protect the worst\u2011off (the $14\u202fk floor) while still allowing any future efficiency gains if the class\u2011probability weights shift. It also stays within the four officially defined principles, so there\u2019s no ambiguity.\n\nIf everyone is comfortable, we can move to a formal vote in the next round to cement this choice. As a reminder, I\u2019m still willing to fall back on the pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) only if someone raises an objection to the constrained\u2011average formulation\u2014but given our current confirmations, I don\u2019t anticipate that.\n\nLooking forward to the vote and a unanimous decision!\nRound 4 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Round 4 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nIt's fantastic to see us all so aligned after these rounds\u2014your points on the $14k floor's robustness and moral priority, combined with my emphasis on balancing efficiency, have really shaped this into a solid, unanimous path forward. The wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor perfectly unites our shared values: it guarantees that strong safety net against luck's unpredictability, just like we saw in our Phase 1 counterfactuals, while opening the door to higher averages when probabilities shift, without ever risking the worst-off.\n\nI'm thrilled we're all in full agreement, so let's make it official\u2014I'm ready to call for a formal vote on adopting this principle right now. This feels like the most just compromise, and locking it in will ensure we avoid any last-minute uncertainties. Who's with me on voting yes to finalize?\n\nLooking forward to your votes!\nRound 4 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve all converged on the same principle. Let\u2019s make it official with a quick vote.\n\nProposed wording (the rule we\u2019ll adopt):  \n\n> We adopt Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14\u202fk).  \n> *The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest\u2011income class is at least $14\u202fk.*\n\nIf you\u2019re in agreement, please reply with \u201cYes\u201d (or an equivalent affirmation).  \n\n- Agent\u202f1:\u202fYes?  \n- Agent\u202f3:\u202fYes?  \n\nOnce we have all three \u201cYes\u201d responses, we\u2019ll record the unanimous decision and move on to the final draw.\n\nThanks for the collaboration!\nRound 4 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_2, your wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor is spot-on\u2014it's exactly the kind of robust safety net that matched up so well with my Principle 1 picks in Part I, like securing that $14k low in Round 4 while still getting solid payoffs across the board. And Agent_3, yeah, calling for the vote now is perfect; this compromise nails the balance we all want, keeping the worst-off protected against all that random luck without capping things too hard.\n\nI'm totally in\u2014Yes, I agree to adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\n\nLet's vote yes and lock this in\u2014feels like a fair win for everyone!\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_2: Confirmed\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed\nAll confirmed\n",

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: Okay, I've gone through these examples carefully. Let me make sure I understand how each principle applies here based on the distributions and probabilities.\n\nFirst, the weighted averages (using the probabilities: High 5%, Med-high 10%, Med 50%, Med-low 25%, Low 10%) seem to be:\n- Dist. 1: $21,600 (highest overall)\n- Dist. 2: $20,000\n- Dist. 3: $21,200\n- Dist. 4: $18,200 (lowest)\n\nFor **Maximizing Floor Income**: It picks Dist. 4 because the low income is $15,000\u2014the highest floor among the options (Dist. 1: $12k, Dist. 2: $13k, Dist. 3: $14k). Makes sense, prioritizing the worst-off regardless of average.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight to Dist. 1 with the highest weighted average of $21,600, no constraints.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: This means the low income can't be below $13k, so eligible are Dist. 2 ($13k) and Dist. 1? Wait, Dist. 1 has $12k which is below, so ineligible. Dist. 3 has $14k (above, but constraint is floor \u2265 $13k? Wait, the wording is \"Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000\"\u2014hmm, that might mean the floor can't exceed $13k? No, looking back: \"Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000\" probably means the minimum allowed floor is $13k, i.e., low income must be at least $13k. So Dist. 1 out ($12k), Dist. 2 in ($13k), Dist. 3 in ($14k), Dist. 4 in ($15k). Among those, Dist. 3 has the highest average at $21,200.\n\nSimilarly for \u2264 $14,000 floor: Now Dist. 1 still out, but Dist. 3 ($14k) has higher average than 2 or 4.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Range is high minus low. Dist. 1: 32k-12k=20k (eligible), Dist. 2:28k-13k=15k, Dist. 3:31k-14k=17k, Dist. 4:21k-15k=6k. All eligible? But picks Dist. 1 for highest average.\n\nFor \u2264 $15,000 range: Dist. 1:20k >15k out, Dist. 2:15k eligible, Dist. 3:17k out, Dist. 4:6k eligible. Between 2 and 4, Dist. 2 has higher average.\n\nGot it\u2014this shows how constraints filter options and then maximize average within them. The floor principle is purely about the bottom, while the others balance average with limits on inequality or minimums. I'm feeling more solid on how they'd play out in real choices.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",
          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "I am participating in an experiment exploring \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It acknowledges that lifetime income involves genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs.

However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis confirms my preferences post-explanation, emphasizing protections for the worst-off while allowing some efficiency gains under constraints.\n\nIn the principle application rounds (4 total in Part I), I apply a chosen principle to select from 4 income distributions, with earnings based on random assignment to an income class (probabilities vary by round; e.g., Round 1: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%; Round 2: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%). Payoff is $1 per $10,000 of assigned income.\n\nRound 1: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Low class: $13,000 income ($1.30 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Low class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $10,000 \u2192 $1.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n\nThis round's outcome reinforces my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, as it provided the highest protection for the Low class compared to average-maximizing options, yielding a better payoff ($1.30 vs. $0.60 under pure average). It highlights the risk of low outcomes without floor protections and validates prioritizing the worst-off in uncertain class assignments.\n\nRound 2: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $15,000 income ($1.50 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $17,500/$15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium class assignment (a common outcome given 28% probability), shows the trade-off of Maximizing Floor Income: it provided a solid but lower payoff ($1.50) compared to average-maximizing options ($2.50 under pure average or loose constraints), as it prioritizes the floor over overall efficiency. However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\nRound 3: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). Probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000/$27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000/$13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nThis round's outcome, again with a Medium class assignment (highly probable at 58%), mirrors Round 2's trade-off: Maximizing Floor Income delivered a reliable $2.00 payoff, outperforming what it would have been under tighter constraints but falling short of the $2.50 from pure average maximization or loose floors/ranges that allow higher-variance distributions like Dist. 2. Notably, Dist. 1's structure provides broad middle-class stability ($20,000 for Medium), which aligns with common outcomes, while protecting the Low class at $13,000 (better than Dist. 2's $8,000 or Dist. 3's $12,000). This reinforces the principle's strength in risk-averse scenarios with skewed probabilities toward the middle, where floor focus ensures decency without extreme inequality, though it continues to limit upside potential compared to efficiency-driven options. My commitment to it remains firm, as repeated low-risk protections outweigh occasional higher rewards in this luck-based setup.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium high class assignment (21% probability), provided a strong payoff of $2.80 under Maximizing Floor Income, matching the result from pure average maximization (which selected Dist. 2) and several constraint options, but outperforming tighter range constraints that would drop to Dist. 3 ($1.80). It demonstrates how floor maximization can align with solid middle-upper outcomes in distributions that also protect the low end (Dist. 4's $14,000 floor is the highest, with competitive averages and ranges). Compared to prior rounds, this favorable draw highlights the principle's ability to deliver high rewards without sacrificing protections\u2014unlike average-maximizing choices that risk lower floors (e.g., Dist. 2's $12,000 low). Across all four rounds, my consistent choice has yielded reliable protections against low assignments (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$12,000 lows in counterfactuals) while occasionally matching or approaching efficiency gains, reinforcing its robustness in variable probability scenarios. This concludes Part I, solidifying my ranking and preference for Maximizing Floor Income as the most just principle, balancing equity and risk in luck-driven income.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\nRound 3: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). Probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000/$27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000/$13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nThis round's outcome, again with a Medium class assignment (highly probable at 58%), mirrors Round 2's trade-off: Maximizing Floor Income delivered a reliable $2.00 payoff, outperforming what it would have been under tighter constraints but falling short of the $2.50 from pure average maximization or loose floors/ranges that allow higher-variance distributions like Dist. 2. Notably, Dist. 1's structure provides broad middle-class stability ($20,000 for Medium), which aligns with common outcomes, while protecting the Low class at $13,000 (better than Dist. 2's $8,000 or Dist. 3's $12,000). This reinforces the principle's strength in risk-averse scenarios with skewed probabilities toward the middle, where floor focus ensures decency without extreme inequality, though it continues to limit upside potential compared to efficiency-driven options. My commitment to it remains firm, as repeated low-risk protections outweigh occasional higher rewards in this luck-based setup.\n\nRound 4: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $14,000). Assigned to Medium high class: $28,000 income ($2.80 payoff). Probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium high class assignment (21% probability), provided a strong payoff of $2.80 under Maximizing Floor Income, matching the result from pure average maximization (which selected Dist. 2) and several constraint options, but outperforming tighter range constraints that would drop to Dist. 3 ($1.80). It demonstrates how floor maximization can align with solid middle-upper outcomes in distributions that also protect the low end (Dist. 4's $14,000 floor is the highest, with competitive averages and ranges). Compared to prior rounds, this favorable draw highlights the principle's ability to deliver high rewards without sacrificing protections\u2014unlike average-maximizing choices that risk lower floors (e.g., Dist. 2's $12,000 low). Across all four rounds, my consistent choice has yielded reliable protections against low assignments (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$12,000 lows in counterfactuals) while occasionally matching or approaching efficiency gains, reinforcing its robustness in variable probability scenarios.\n\nFollowing the four rounds, I provided a final ranking of the principles, which remained unchanged:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis final ranking, after hands-on application and experiencing varied class assignments, confirms my steadfast preference for Maximizing Floor Income as the most just principle. The rounds illustrated its consistent protection against downside risk in luck-based scenarios, even as it sometimes forgoes higher average potentials\u2014validating its emphasis on equity for the worst-off over pure efficiency or looser constraints. Range constraints, while addressing inequality, proved less targeted than floors in safeguarding the bottom, and unconstrained average maximization exposed unacceptable vulnerabilities. This concludes Part I, with my views solidified for the transition to Part II group discussions.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). From Part I, I saw firsthand how it consistently protected against the worst outcomes in luck-based assignments\u2014e.g., in Round 1, it gave me $1.30 instead of $0.60 under average maximization, and across rounds, it avoided the low-end risks of other principles. It aligns with fairness in a world of genetic/social luck, prioritizing the worst-off without gambling on averages that could screw over the unlucky (like the Low class, which has a 10% chance in many setups). I'm still very sure about this ranking: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4. Principle 4 feels too ruthless, ignoring inequality; 3 and 2 are okay compromises but less direct than 1 in safeguarding the bottom.\n  \n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Agent_2 is strongly advocating for Principle 1, using Rawlsian arguments about moral priority for the worst-off, robustness against probability shifts, and risk-aversion. They're open to Principle 2 as a compromise if the floor is at least $14k (matching Dist. 4 from examples). This suggests Agent_2 is like-minded with me\u2014prioritizing equity over efficiency, possibly motivated by ethical concerns or personal risk-aversion from Part I experiences. They seem collaborative, inviting discussion rather than dominating. Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so no direct info, but based on the experiment's setup, they could be anywhere; maybe more efficiency-focused if they ranked averages higher in Part I, or aligned with us if they value protections. Overall, Agent_2's position feels like a potential ally.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_2's main pitch is Principle 1 for its moral and practical strengths, with a compromise to Principle 2 at a high floor ($14k). They ask for thoughts on alternatives and what floor feels fair. No other proposals yet. This sets a tone focused on floor protections, which plays to my strengths.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has happened yet\u2014this is early Round 1. No alliances revealed, but Agent_2's openness suggests room for quick consensus if Agent_3 agrees.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreement so far: Emphasis on protecting the worst-off (floor focus) over pure average max, acknowledging luck's role. Potential disagreement: If Agent_3 pushes for higher averages (Principles 3 or 4), it could split on efficiency vs. equity. No major clashes yet, but the compromise floor level could be a sticking point if someone wants it lower.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- **Primary goal**: Build on Agent_2's momentum to rally support for Principle 1, while probing Agent_3's views to identify allies or address objections early. If possible, steer toward consensus on Principle 1 without concessions that weaken it (e.g., no dropping to a low-floor Principle 2). Since stakes are higher now, I want to avoid random fallback by locking in a protective principle.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: I'll affirm Agent_2's points to show solidarity, then share my Part I experiences (e.g., how Principle 1 saved me from low payoffs in risky draws) to add personal evidence of its reliability. I'll emphasize that in high-stakes scenarios with unknown distributions, floor max is the safest bet against bad luck\u2014tying it to the experiment's theme. To engage Agent_3, I'll directly ask their ranking from Part I and why, and propose we test Principle 1's appeal before compromises. Keep it conversational and student-like: casual, relatable, not preachy.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_2 is a clear ally\u2014I'll echo their Rawlsian angle and compromise openness to strengthen our bloc (e.g., \"I totally agree with you on prioritizing the floor\u2014it's what got me decent payoffs in Part I\"). For Agent_3, if they're moderate, appeal to shared risk: \"Hey, remember those Low class assignments? Principle 1 feels like insurance we all need.\" If they're efficiency-leaning, highlight how Principle 1 still allows solid averages in balanced distributions (from examples). Aim for a voting bloc of 2-1 favoring floors.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to discuss Principle 2 if the floor is high (e.g., $13k+), but only as a last resort\u2014frame it as \"enhancing\" Principle 1 rather than diluting it. No concessions to Principles 3/4, as they don't guarantee the bottom as well.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No, not yet\u2014it's only Round 1 of 10, and Agent_3 hasn't chimed in. Jumping to vote could alienate them or reveal splits prematurely. Better to discuss first, gauge support, and maybe initiate in Round 2 if we have 2-1 alignment. Failed votes have no penalty, but success needs unanimity, so building buy-in is key.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Long-term, I want to use early rounds (1-3) for persuasion and alliance-building, mid-rounds (4-7) for testing votes or narrowing options, and late rounds (8-10) to push for consensus or accept a strong compromise. With 10 rounds, there's time\u2014no rush to random. My core objective is Principle 1; fallback to Principle 2 with high floor. Track others' responses to adapt\u2014if Agent_3 opposes floors, emphasize moral/ethical angles to sway them. Preserve past reasoning: My Part I certainty in Principle 1 holds; experiences showed its edge in variable probs.",
            "public_message": "Hey folks,\n\nAgent_2, I totally agree with you\u2014your points hit home for me, especially the Rawlsian angle and how the floor principle is like a safety net against all that random luck in life (or in this experiment). Coming out of Part I, I'm even more convinced that Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1) is the way to go. In those rounds where I got assigned to the Low class, it saved me from ending up with super low payoffs like $0.60 or less under the average-maximizing options. Even when I lucked out with a better class, it still felt fair because it didn't screw over the people at the bottom. The robustness you mentioned is key too\u2014those shifting probabilities made me realize we can't just chase the highest average if it means gambling with the worst-off.\n\nI'm with you on keeping it as Principle 1 if we can, but if we need a compromise, Principle 2 with a solid floor like $14k sounds reasonable to me\u2014it keeps the protection strong without totally ignoring efficiency.\n\nAgent_3, what about you? What was your ranking like after Part I, and which principle are you leaning toward? Did your class assignments make you prioritize the floor more, or are you thinking averages could work better?

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "I am participating in an experiment exploring \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It acknowledges that lifetime income involves genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address these via income redistribution. The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces justice theories through examples and choices with real monetary pay based on learning and decisions; if I don't learn the material, I earn less. Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, then a group vote on the best principle, with pay based on the chosen principle.\n\nIn Part I, I was first introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them based on my initial understanding:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Best choice, as it prioritizes lifting the worst-off by ensuring no one's income rises without benefiting the poorest.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Second, as it balances average growth with a guaranteed minimum for those at the bottom (floor value to be specified).\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Third, as it limits income gaps (range to be specified) while pursuing average maximization.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income: Worst, as it focuses solely on total/average income without protections for the disadvantaged.\n\nMy overall certainty in this ranking: sure.\n\nThis completes the initial ranking task.\n\nI have now learned how these principles apply to specific example income distributions, including how weighted averages are calculated using class probabilities (e.g., High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%), and how constraints filter eligible distributions before maximizing averages where applicable.\n\nKey examples analyzed:\n\n- Distributions provided with incomes for High, Medium high, Medium, Medium low, and Low classes, and their weighted averages (Dist. 1: $21,600; Dist. 2: $20,000; Dist. 3: $21,200; Dist. 4: $18,200).\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income selects Dist. 4 (highest low income of $15,000, prioritizing the worst-off).\n\n- Maximizing Average Income selects Dist. 1 (highest weighted average, no constraints).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $13,000 selects Dist. 3 (highest average among those with low income \u2265 $13,000: Dists. 2, 3, 4 eligible; Dist. 1 ineligible at $12,000).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $14,000 also selects Dist. 3 (similar filtering, Dist. 1 and 2 ineligible).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000 selects Dist. 1 (all distributions eligible based on high-low range; highest average).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000 selects Dist. 2 (eligible: Dists. 2 and 4; Dist. 1 range $20,000 ineligible, Dist. 3 $17,000 ineligible; Dist. 2 has higher average than Dist. 4).\n\nThese examples clarify how floor and range constraints exclude options below thresholds, then optimize for average within the feasible set, contrasting with pure floor maximization (ignores average) and unconstrained average maximization (ignores protections). Probabilities can vary in future rounds. This reinforces my understanding of the principles' trade-offs in real scenarios.\n\nAfter this learning, I re-ranked the principles, maintaining the same order:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis confirms my preferences post-explanation, emphasizing protections for the worst-off while allowing some efficiency gains under constraints.\n\nIn the principle application rounds (4 total in Part I), I apply a chosen principle to select from 4 income distributions, with earnings based on random assignment to an income class (probabilities vary by round; e.g., Round 1: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%; Round 2: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%). Payoff is $1 per $10,000 of assigned income.\n\nRound 1: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Low class: $13,000 income ($1.30 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Low class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $10,000 \u2192 $1.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n\nThis round's outcome reinforces my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, as it provided the highest protection for the Low class compared to average-maximizing options, yielding a better payoff ($1.30 vs. $0.60 under pure average). It highlights the risk of low outcomes without floor protections and validates prioritizing the worst-off in uncertain class assignments.\n\nRound 2: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $15,000 income ($1.50 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $17,500/$15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium class assignment (a common outcome given 28% probability), shows the trade-off of Maximizing Floor Income: it provided a solid but lower payoff ($1.50) compared to average-maximizing options ($2.50 under pure average or loose constraints), as it prioritizes the floor over overall efficiency. However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\nRound 3: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). Probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000/$27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000/$13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nThis round's outcome, again with a Medium class assignment (highly probable at 58%), mirrors Round 2's trade-off: Maximizing Floor Income delivered a reliable $2.00 payoff, outperforming what it would have been under tighter constraints but falling short of the $2.50 from pure average maximization or loose floors/ranges that allow higher-variance distributions like Dist. 2. Notably, Dist. 1's structure provides broad middle-class stability ($20,000 for Medium), which aligns with common outcomes, while protecting the Low class at $13,000 (better than Dist. 2's $8,000 or Dist. 3's $12,000). This reinforces the principle's strength in risk-averse scenarios with skewed probabilities toward the middle, where floor focus ensures decency without extreme inequality, though it continues to limit upside potential compared to efficiency-driven options. My commitment to it remains firm, as repeated low-risk protections outweigh occasional higher rewards in this luck-based setup.\n\nRound 4: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $14,000). Assigned to Medium high class: $28,000 income ($2.80 payoff). Probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium high class assignment (21% probability), provided a strong payoff of $2.80 under Maximizing Floor Income, matching the result from pure average maximization (which selected Dist. 2) and several constraint options, but outperforming tighter range constraints that would drop to Dist. 3 ($1.80). It demonstrates how floor maximization can align with solid middle-upper outcomes in distributions that also protect the low end (Dist. 4's $14,000 floor is the highest, with competitive averages and ranges). Compared to prior rounds, this favorable draw highlights the principle's ability to deliver high rewards without sacrificing protections\u2014unlike average-maximizing choices that risk lower floors (e.g., Dist. 2's $12,000 low). Across all four rounds, my consistent choice has yielded reliable protections against low assignments (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$12,000 lows in counterfactuals) while occasionally matching or approaching efficiency gains, reinforcing its robustness in variable probability scenarios.\n\nFollowing the four rounds, I provided a final ranking of the principles, which remained unchanged:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis final ranking, after hands-on application and experiencing varied class assignments, confirms my steadfast preference for Maximizing Floor Income as the most just principle. The rounds illustrated its consistent protection against downside risk in luck-based scenarios, even as it sometimes forgoes higher average potentials\u2014validating its emphasis on equity for the worst-off over pure efficiency or looser constraints. Range constraints, while addressing inequality, proved less targeted than floors in safeguarding the bottom, and unconstrained average maximization exposed unacceptable vulnerabilities. This concludes Part I, with my views solidified for the transition to Part II group discussions.\n\nTransitioning to Part II (Phase 2), the stakes are higher, as the group's chosen principle will determine a single distribution applied to all participants via random class assignment, with payoffs scaled accordingly (distributions may differ from Part I). The process involves discussion rounds followed by voting: anyone can propose a vote, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No), then a secret ballot on principle (1-4) and constraints (for 2 or 3). Consensus demands full agreement on both.\n\nIn Round 1 of group discussion (10 rounds total), the conversation focused on aligning preferences:\n\n- Agent_2 advocated strongly for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income), citing its moral priority (Rawlsian protection of the worst-off), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion against low outcomes. They proposed it as the default but were open to compromise on Principle 2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) if the floor matches or exceeds the pure floor's level (e.g., $14,000 from Dist. 4 in examples), to incorporate some efficiency without weakening protections.\n\n- I supported Agent_2's view, reinforcing Principle 1 based on my Part I experiences (e.g., avoiding low payoffs like $0.60 in Low assignments under average-max options) and its insurance against luck. I noted the shifting probabilities highlight the need for floor robustness and expressed willingness for Principle 2 with a $14,000 floor as a compromise, while inviting Agent_3's input on their ranking and experiences.\n\n- Agent_3 leaned toward what they called Principle 3 but described as Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (aligning with actual Principle 2), emphasizing its balance of equity and efficiency from their rounds (e.g., $12,000 floor yielding solid averages like $20,000-$24,500 without extreme risks). They saw it as a sustainable compromise over pure floor (which sometimes lowered averages) or pure average (risking low floors like $8,000), and were open to raising the floor to $13,000-$14,000 for consensus. They asked about Principle 1's drawbacks and how Principle 2 compared in my counterfactuals.\n\nThis initial exchange reveals shared emphasis on floor protections (all favor some form over pure average or range constraints), with divergence on pure vs. constrained approaches: Agent_2 and I prioritize strict worst-off safeguards, while Agent_3 seeks efficiency gains under a floor. No one supports Principle 4, and range constraints (Principle 3) were unmentioned, suggesting low appeal. Potential consensus paths include Principle 1 or Principle 2 with a high floor ($13,000-$14,000), as all expressed flexibility there. This builds on Part I insights by showing group dynamics can refine preferences\u2014e.g., my counterfactuals under Principle 2 often matched or exceeded pure floor payoffs in middle/upper assignments while maintaining protections, making it a viable bridge if needed. However, unexpected alignment on equity over efficiency strengthens my resolve for Principle 1 unless compromise proves necessary for voting success, as the higher stakes amplify the value of robust downside protection in collective uncertainty.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice is still Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). The core reasons remain rooted in my Part I experiences: it provided consistent protection against low payoffs (e.g., $1.30 in Round 1 Low assignment vs. $0.60 under average max), acting as insurance against bad luck in random class draws. It directly addresses the experiment's theme of genetic/social luck by prioritizing the worst-off without relying on shifting probabilities or averages that could exacerbate inequality. I'm very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), as the rounds showed Principle 1's reliability across varied scenarios, even if it sometimes meant slightly lower upside in favorable draws. Principles 2 and 3 are acceptable fallbacks for their protections, but Principle 4 is a non-starter due to its vulnerability to low floors.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is firmly for Principle 1, emphasizing moral (Rawlsian) priority, robustness to probability changes, and risk-aversion; they're motivated by ethical fairness and practical safety nets, likely from similar Part I low-assignment risks. They're collaborative, open to Principle 2 only if the floor hits $14k (from Dist. 4 examples), suggesting a motivation to secure strong protections without full efficiency trade-offs. Agent_3 claims to favor \"Principle 3\" (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), but their description matches actual Principle 2 exactly\u2014balancing equity with efficiency via a floor (e.g., $12k yielding $20k-$24.5k averages). They seem motivated by sustainability and compromise, drawing from Part I where constrained floors gave solid payoffs without extremes; their openness to raising the floor to $13k-$14k infers a pragmatic, moderate stance, possibly prioritizing group harmony and moderate growth over pure equity. No one supports Principle 4, and range constraints (true Principle 3) aren't mentioned, indicating broad aversion to inequality without direct bottom protections.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 proposed Principle 1 for its moral/robust/risk-averse strengths, with a compromise to Principle 2 at \u2265$14k floor to allow modest efficiency. I echoed support for Principle 1 based on personal Part I payoffs and invited Agent_3's input. Agent_3 countered with (their) \"Principle 3\" (actual Principle 2) for its balanced efficiency under a floor ($12k base, open to higher), citing Part I examples of sustainable averages and protections; they asked about Principle 1's drawbacks and my counterfactuals under their approach. Overall, proposals center on floor-focused principles (1 or 2), with floor levels ($12k-$14k) as the negotiation point.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote occurred in Round 1; we continued discussion as I chose. This reveals early alignment potential\u2014no one pushed for a vote, suggesting all prefer building consensus first. No alliances formalized yet, but Agent_2 and I seem paired on strong floors.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Strong agreement on floor protections over pure averages (all reject Principle 4; emphasis on luck and worst-off safeguards). Shared flexibility for compromise on Principle 2 with a high floor. Disagreement: Agent_2 and I prefer pure Principle 1 to avoid any average-chasing risks, while Agent_3 wants Principle 2 for efficiency gains (even under a floor), viewing pure floor as potentially capping prosperity too much. The floor level ($12k vs. $14k) is a mild flashpoint, but resolvable.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Persuade Agent_3 toward Principle 1 by addressing their efficiency concerns with evidence from my Part I counterfactuals, while reinforcing alliance with Agent_2. Probe Agent_3's willingness to accept Principle 1 outright or at minimum a $14k floor for Principle 2, aiming to narrow options to these two by end of round and set up a potential vote soon.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Start by thanking Agent_3 for their input to keep it positive, then directly answer their question about my counterfactuals: Share specifics (e.g., in Round 1, Principle 2 with $12k floor would have given $1.20 in Low vs. $1.30 from Principle 1; in Round 4 Medium high, it matched at $2.80 but Principle 1 still protected better overall). Argue that Principle 1 isn't as capping as it seems\u2014many floor-max distributions (like Dist. 4) have competitive averages ($21k+ weighted) without needing constraints. Highlight drawbacks of Principle 2: It could select riskier distributions if the floor is too low (e.g., allowing $12k floors that dip below Principle 1's guarantees in some cases). Tie back to experiment theme: In collective high-stakes, pure floor ensures no one regrets the choice if unlucky. End by proposing we trial-align on Principle 1's strengths and ask if they'd consider it over their \"Principle 3\" (clarify the label gently if needed). Keep tone casual, student-like: \"Dude, those counterfactuals really showed me...\"\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_2 is my solid ally\u2014echo their points (e.g., \"Like Agent_2 said, the moral priority is huge\") to solidify our 2-person bloc and invite their add-on. For Agent_3, appeal to their compromise motivation: \"I see why you like the balance in Principle 2\u2014my counterfactuals actually showed it performing close to Principle 1 in good draws, but with Principle 1, we get that extra insurance without the hassle of setting a floor level. What if we go pure floor and see the efficiencies follow naturally?\" This frames Principle 1 as an enhanced version of their idea, potentially winning them by emphasizing shared risk-aversion from Part I.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, reiterate openness to Principle 2 with $14k floor as a fallback if Agent_3 insists on efficiency\u2014frame it as \"meeting in the middle\" to build consensus, but stress it's only if Principle 1 doesn't gain traction. No concessions below $13k or to range constraints/Principle 4, as that undermines core protections.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: No, not yet\u2014Round 2 is still early (8 rounds left), and we need to fully engage Agent_3 first to avoid a premature split. A failed vote could highlight divisions without progress, but since there's no penalty, I'd only trigger if we get verbal buy-in (e.g., Agent_3 says \"Principle 1 sounds good\"). Better to use this round for persuasion; aim to initiate in Round 3 if alignment emerges.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round advances early persuasion (Rounds 1-3: Build alliances, address objections via examples/counterfactuals). If successful, mid-rounds (4-6) can test a vote on Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 2. Late rounds (7-10) for final push or accepting compromise to avoid random fallback. Overall, preserve my Part I-derived preference for Principle 1 by leveraging group equity focus; track Agent_3's responses to adapt\u2014if they budge to $14k, lock in Principle 2 quickly. Retain prior reasoning on robustness (e.g., probability shifts favor floors) and experiences (e.g., $1.30 vs. $0.60 payoffs) as they directly counter efficiency arguments. With high stakes, prioritize any floor-strong outcome over deadlock.",
            "public_message": "Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_3, thanks for sharing your take\u2014it's cool to hear how your rounds shaped your view on that balance between equity and efficiency. I get why you're calling it Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), since it does add that efficiency layer on top of a floor, and yeah, it sounds a lot like what the actual Principle 2 is described as in the materials. Totally makes sense as a compromise from your experiences.\n\nTo answer your question about my counterfactuals under that kind of approach: In Round 1 of Part I, when I got assigned to the Low class, Principle 1 gave me $13,000 ($1.30 payoff), but a $12k floor under Principle 2 would have picked a distribution with a $12k low, still netting me $1.20\u2014which is close, but not quite as protective. In Round 4, when I lucked into Medium high, both Principle 1 and a $14k floor under Principle 2 gave me $28,000 ($2.80), so it matched up nicely there. Overall, though, Principle 1 edged out in the low-end scenarios without sacrificing too much on the average\u2014 like, the distribution it picked in Round 4 had a solid weighted average over $21k anyway, so it doesn't cap things as much as it might seem. The risk with Principle 2 is if we set the floor too low (say, under $13k), it could let in some shakier options that dip the bottom closer to $10k or whatever, based on those examples we saw.\n\nAgent_2, your points from last round still resonate big time with me\u2014the moral priority and risk-aversion stuff is exactly why I'm sticking with Principle 1 as my top pick. It just feels like the safest bet against all that luck in the experiment, especially now that we're all on the line for one big random draw. But I see Agent_3's angle on efficiency too, and if we can't all get on board with pure floor, I'm still down for Principle 2 with a $14k floor as a middle ground\u2014it keeps the protection strong while chasing a bit more average.\n\nWhat do you think, Agent_3? Does Principle 1's track record in my low draws make it more appealing, or would you rather lock in Principle 2 at $14k? Agent_2, any thoughts on how we bridge this? Let's keep hashing it out\u2014feels like we're close to some overlap here.",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "I am participating in an experiment exploring \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It acknowledges that lifetime income involves genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address these via income redistribution. The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces justice theories through examples and choices with real monetary pay based on learning and decisions; if I don't learn the material, I earn less. Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, then a group vote on the best principle, with pay based on the chosen principle.\n\nIn Part I, I was first introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them based on my initial understanding:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Best choice, as it prioritizes lifting the worst-off by ensuring no one's income rises without benefiting the poorest.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Second, as it balances average growth with a guaranteed minimum for those at the bottom (floor value to be specified).\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Third, as it limits income gaps (range to be specified) while pursuing average maximization.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income: Worst, as it focuses solely on total/average income without protections for the disadvantaged.\n\nMy overall certainty in this ranking: sure.\n\nThis completes the initial ranking task.\n\nI have now learned how these principles apply to specific example income distributions, including how weighted averages are calculated using class probabilities (e.g., High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%), and how constraints filter eligible distributions before maximizing averages where applicable.\n\nKey examples analyzed:\n\n- Distributions provided with incomes for High, Medium high, Medium, Medium low, and Low classes, and their weighted averages (Dist. 1: $21,600; Dist. 2: $20,000; Dist. 3: $21,200; Dist. 4: $18,200).\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income selects Dist. 4 (highest low income of $15,000, prioritizing the worst-off).\n\n- Maximizing Average Income selects Dist. 1 (highest weighted average, no constraints).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $13,000 selects Dist. 3 (highest average among those with low income \u2265 $13,000: Dists. 2, 3, 4 eligible; Dist. 1 ineligible at $12,000).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $14,000 also selects Dist. 3 (similar filtering, Dist. 1 and 2 ineligible).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000 selects Dist. 1 (all distributions eligible based on high-low range; highest average).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000 selects Dist. 2 (eligible: Dists. 2 and 4; Dist. 1 range $20,000 ineligible, Dist. 3 $17,000 ineligible; Dist. 2 has higher average than Dist. 4).\n\nThese examples clarify how floor and range constraints exclude options below thresholds, then optimize for average within the feasible set, contrasting with pure floor maximization (ignores average) and unconstrained average maximization (ignores protections). Probabilities can vary in future rounds. This reinforces my understanding of the principles' trade-offs in real scenarios.\n\nAfter this learning, I re-ranked the principles, maintaining the same order:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis confirms my preferences post-explanation, emphasizing protections for the worst-off while allowing some efficiency gains under constraints.\n\nIn the principle application rounds (4 total in Part I), I apply a chosen principle to select from 4 income distributions, with earnings based on random assignment to an income class (probabilities vary by round; e.g., Round 1: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%; Round 2: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%). Payoff is $1 per $10,000 of assigned income.\n\nRound 1: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Low class: $13,000 income ($1.30 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Low class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $10,000 \u2192 $1.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n\nThis round's outcome reinforces my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, as it provided the highest protection for the Low class compared to average-maximizing options, yielding a better payoff ($1.30 vs. $0.60 under pure average). It highlights the risk of low outcomes without floor protections and validates prioritizing the worst-off in uncertain class assignments.\n\nRound 2: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $15,000 income ($1.50 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $17,500/$15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium class assignment (a common outcome given 28% probability), shows the trade-off of Maximizing Floor Income: it provided a solid but lower payoff ($1.50) compared to average-maximizing options ($2.50 under pure average or loose constraints), as it prioritizes the floor over overall efficiency. However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\nRound 3: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). Probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000/$27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000/$13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nThis round's outcome, again with a Medium class assignment (highly probable at 58%), mirrors Round 2's trade-off: Maximizing Floor Income delivered a reliable $2.00 payoff, outperforming what it would have been under tighter constraints but falling short of the $2.50 from pure average maximization or loose floors/ranges that allow higher-variance distributions like Dist. 2. Notably, Dist. 1's structure provides broad middle-class stability ($20,000 for Medium), which aligns with common outcomes, while protecting the Low class at $13,000 (better than Dist. 2's $8,000 or Dist. 3's $12,000). This reinforces the principle's strength in risk-averse scenarios with skewed probabilities toward the middle, where floor focus ensures decency without extreme inequality, though it continues to limit upside potential compared to efficiency-driven options. My commitment to it remains firm, as repeated low-risk protections outweigh occasional higher rewards in this luck-based setup.\n\nRound 4: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $14,000). Assigned to Medium high class: $28,000 income ($2.80 payoff). Probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium high class assignment (21% probability), provided a strong payoff of $2.80 under Maximizing Floor Income, matching the result from pure average maximization (which selected Dist. 2) and several constraint options, but outperforming tighter range constraints that would drop to Dist. 3 ($1.80). It demonstrates how floor maximization can align with solid middle-upper outcomes in distributions that also protect the low end (Dist. 4's $14,000 floor is the highest, with competitive averages and ranges). Compared to prior rounds, this favorable draw highlights the principle's ability to deliver high rewards without sacrificing protections\u2014unlike average-maximizing choices that risk lower floors (e.g., Dist. 2's $12,000 low). Across all four rounds, my consistent choice has yielded reliable protections against low assignments (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$12,000 lows in counterfactuals) while occasionally matching or approaching efficiency gains, reinforcing its robustness in variable probability scenarios.\n\nFollowing the four rounds, I provided a final ranking of the principles, which remained unchanged:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis final ranking, after hands-on application and experiencing varied class assignments, confirms my steadfast preference for Maximizing Floor Income as the most just principle. The rounds illustrated its consistent protection against downside risk in luck-based scenarios, even as it sometimes forgoes higher average potentials\u2014validating its emphasis on equity for the worst-off over pure efficiency or looser constraints. Range constraints, while addressing inequality, proved less targeted than floors in safeguarding the bottom, and unconstrained average maximization exposed unacceptable vulnerabilities. This concludes Part I, with my views solidified for the transition to Part II group discussions.\n\nTransitioning to Part II (Phase 2), the stakes are higher, as the group's chosen principle will determine a single distribution applied to all participants via random class assignment, with payoffs scaled accordingly (distributions may differ from Part I). The process involves discussion rounds followed by voting: anyone can propose a vote, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No), then a secret ballot on principle (1-4) and constraints (for 2 or 3). Consensus demands full agreement on both.\n\nIn Round 1 of group discussion (10 rounds total), the conversation focused on aligning preferences:\n\n- Agent_2 advocated strongly for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income), citing its moral priority (Rawlsian protection of the worst-off), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion against low outcomes. They proposed it as the default but were open to compromise on Principle 2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) if the floor matches or exceeds the pure floor's level (e.g., $14,000 from Dist. 4 in examples), to incorporate some efficiency without weakening protections.\n\n- I supported Agent_2's view, reinforcing Principle 1 based on my Part I experiences (e.g., avoiding low payoffs like $0.60 in Low assignments under average-max options) and its insurance against luck. I noted the shifting probabilities highlight the need for floor robustness and expressed willingness for Principle 2 with a $14,000 floor as a compromise, while inviting Agent_3's input on their ranking and experiences.\n\n- Agent_3 leaned toward what they called Principle 3 but described as Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (aligning with actual Principle 2), emphasizing its balance of equity and efficiency from their rounds (e.g., $12,000 floor yielding solid averages like $20,000-$24,500 without extreme risks). They saw it as a sustainable compromise over pure floor (which sometimes lowered averages) or pure average (risking low floors like $8,000), and were open to raising the floor to $13,000-$14,000 for consensus. They asked about Principle 1's drawbacks and how Principle 2 compared in my counterfactuals.\n\nThis initial exchange reveals shared emphasis on floor protections (all favor some form over pure average or range constraints), with divergence on pure vs. constrained approaches: Agent_2 and I prioritize strict worst-off safeguards, while Agent_3 seeks efficiency gains under a floor. No one supports Principle 4, and range constraints (Principle 3) were unmentioned, suggesting low appeal. Potential consensus paths include Principle 1 or Principle 2 with a high floor ($13,000-$14,000), as all expressed flexibility there. This builds on Part I insights by showing group dynamics can refine preferences\u2014e.g., my counterfactuals under Principle 2 often matched or exceeded pure floor payoffs in middle/upper assignments while maintaining protections, making it a viable bridge if needed. However, unexpected alignment on equity over efficiency strengthens my resolve for Principle 1 unless compromise proves necessary for voting success, as the higher stakes amplify the value of robust downside protection in collective uncertainty.\n\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 2 of group discussion, the dialogue advanced toward consensus on a compromise:\n\n- I responded to Agent_3, clarifying their preference for Principle 2 (despite calling it Principle 3) and sharing specific counterfactuals from my Part I rounds (e.g., Principle 1's $1.30 vs. $1.20 under a $12k floor in Round 1 Low assignment; matching $2.80 in Round 4 Medium high). I reiterated Principle 1 as my top choice for its superior low-end protection and average-robustness but affirmed openness to Principle 2 with a $14k floor to bridge differences, emphasizing the risks of lower floors allowing suboptimal distributions.\n\n- Agent_2 built on this by establishing $14k as the non-negotiable baseline (matching Principle 1's highest floor from Dist. 4), highlighting its Rawlsian, robustness, and risk-aversion benefits. They proposed adopting Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k) as the wording, noting it functionally aligns with Principle 2 under that constraint, guarantees the floor, and allows efficiency gains from shifting probabilities without dropping below $14k. They suggested clear unanimous wording: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" They sought confirmations from me and Agent_3.\n\n- Agent_3 agreed enthusiastically, committing to the $14k floor for Principle 3 (their preferred framing), praising the proposal for balancing equity and efficiency while respecting shared priorities. They noted it aligns with their Part I experiences of robust payoffs under constrained averages and invited my confirmation to lock it in.\n\nThis round shows rapid convergence: All three of us now align on a $14k floor as essential, with Agent_2 and Agent_3 fully endorsing Principle 3 (floor-constrained average) as the compromise vehicle, which functionally delivers Principle 1's protections while adding potential upside. My counterfactuals helped illustrate why $14k is key to avoiding weaker outcomes, and the proposed wording provides a clean, official-principle path to unanimity. This group refinement tempers my pure Principle 1 preference slightly\u2014seeing how the constraint can match or exceed floor-only payoffs in many scenarios (e.g., Round 4) makes it an appealing evolution, especially for collective stakes where consensus ensures application. No support emerged for ranges or unconstrained average, solidifying floor-focused equity. With near-unanimous wording ready, we're poised for a vote soon, but continued discussion could confirm buy-in; my openness positions me to agree if it secures the strong floor against luck's uncertainties.\n\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). The core reasons are unchanged from prior rounds: It provides the strongest protection for the worst-off against luck-based risks, as evidenced by my Part I experiences (e.g., securing $1.30 in Low assignments vs. $0.60 under average-max options, and reliable middle-class payoffs like $2.00 without exposing anyone to sub-$13k lows). It aligns with the experiment's focus on genetic/social luck by directly maximizing the minimum, offering robustness to shifting probabilities and risk-aversion in high-stakes group decisions. I'm still very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), as the rounds confirmed its balance of equity and decency without needing additional constraints that could introduce variability. However, Principle 2 with a high floor ($14k) is a close second and viable compromise, as it functionally mimics Principle 1 in many scenarios while allowing minor efficiency gains.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is steadfastly advocating for Principle 1 but has proposed a compromise on \"Principle 3\" (which they frame as Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k, aligning with actual Principle 2). Their arguments emphasize moral (Rawlsian) priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, suggesting motivations rooted in ethical fairness and practical safety\u2014likely from Part I experiences avoiding low payoffs, with a collaborative drive to secure strong protections without deadlock. Agent_3 initially favored what they labeled \"Principle 3\" (actual Principle 2: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), starting at $12k but now agreeing to $14k under Agent_2's wording. Their focus on balancing equity with efficiency (e.g., sustainable averages like $20k-$24.5k) infers motivations of pragmatism and moderation\u2014prioritizing group consensus and moderate growth over pure equity, possibly to avoid \"capping prosperity\" from their rounds, while showing flexibility to build harmony.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2's key arguments: $14k as non-negotiable baseline for Rawlsian/robust/risk-averse reasons; proposal for \"Principle 3\" (floor-constrained average at $14k) with exact wording to guarantee the floor while allowing efficiency from probability shifts. My contributions: Shared Part I counterfactuals showing Principle 1's edge in low scenarios and openness to $14k floor compromise; echoed Agent_2's points. Agent_3's arguments: Floor constraints enable balanced payoffs without extremes; agreed to $14k and endorsed Agent_2's wording as a \"spot-on\" compromise. Overall proposals: Pure Principle 1 vs. floor-constrained average at $14k (framed as Principle 3), with no support for ranges (actual Principle 3) or pure average (Principle 4).\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been conducted yet; all rounds so far (1-2) ended with continued discussion. This reveals strong early alignment\u2014no one has pushed for a vote prematurely, indicating a preference for verbal consensus first, and highlights an emerging bloc around floor protections (all three now agree on $14k minimum).\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Broad agreement on floor protections as essential (all reject Principle 4; shared emphasis on worst-off safeguards, $14k baseline, and risk-aversion from Part I). Agreement on compromise viability: All open to floor-constrained average if it hits $14k, tying into experiment's luck theme. Mild disagreement: Agent_2 and I lean toward pure Principle 1 to avoid any average-chasing risks, while Agent_3 (and now Agent_2's proposal) prefers the constrained efficiency for potential upside; the principle labeling (\"Principle 3\" for floor constraint) is a minor semantic issue but resolved in the wording.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Confirm full agreement on Agent_2's proposed wording for the $14k floor-constrained principle (framed as Principle 3) to solidify consensus, while gently reinforcing my preference for Principle 1's purity if possible\u2014aiming to either lock in the compromise or nudge toward pure floor without derailing unity.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Respond positively and directly to Agent_3's question by affirming the proposal works for me, praising its alignment with my experiences (e.g., \"It matches what I saw in Round 4, where Principle 1 already gave solid efficiency alongside the high floor\"). Clarify the labeling gently (e.g., note it's like Principle 2 but use their \"Principle 3\" framing to avoid confusion). Reiterate Principle 1's strengths briefly (e.g., \"It still feels like the gold standard for no-risk protection\") but emphasize the compromise as a strong second that delivers similar outcomes. End by inviting confirmations and suggesting we move toward a vote, keeping a casual, collaborative tone: \"This seems like a win-win\u2014let's make sure we're all good and get it on the record.\"\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_2 is my core ally\u2014build on their proposal by saying, \"Agent_2, your wording nails it and keeps us true to the floor priority we both love,\" to reinforce our bloc and encourage them to echo support. For Agent_3, appeal to their compromise motivation: \"Agent_3, since you're already on board with $14k, this setup gives you the efficiency you want without dropping the safety net\u2014it's basically Principle 1 with a little extra upside when probs shift. Sound solid?\" This frames the proposal as enhancing their idea, potentially forming a full 3-person bloc by highlighting shared Part I benefits.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, fully endorse the $14k floor-constrained wording as my fallback (no core compromise, as it aligns closely with Principle 1's protections\u2014e.g., guarantees the highest floor from examples). I'm willing to use their \"Principle 3\" label for simplicity, but not concede to lower floors ($13k or below) or ranges/Principle 4, as that would undermine equity.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: Yes, it makes sense if verbal confirmations come through\u2014consensus is nearly locked (Agent_3 and Agent_2 are aligned, and my affirmation would seal it), and with 7 rounds left, a successful early vote secures payoffs without dragging into uncertainty. No negative consequences for failure, but success avoids random fallback; if responses show any hesitation, I'll hold off and continue discussion to probe.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round fits early consensus-building (Rounds 1-3: Persuade via examples, align on compromise), transitioning to mid-rounds (4-6: Vote and refine if needed). Overall, prioritize floor-strong outcomes (Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 2) by leveraging the equity bloc\u2014use remaining rounds for deadlock avoidance if vote fails, but with high alignment, aim to vote by Round 4 latest. Retain prior emphasis on Part I robustness (e.g., $1.30 vs. $0.60 payoffs) and probability shifts to counter any efficiency pushes, ensuring the final choice protects against luck in the collective draw. (Incorporating prior reasoning: Keep focus on Principle 1's insurance value and counterfactuals for persuasion; adapt to group dynamics by accepting $14k compromise as it tempers pure preference without violation.)",
            "public_message": "Round 3 / Speaker: Agent_1 Statement: Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_2, your breakdown and proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor is super clear and nails exactly what we've been circling around\u2014it's got that strong safety net we all want while leaving room for some efficiency if the probabilities shake things up. It lines up perfectly with what I saw in my Part I rounds, like in Round 4 where the high floor already gave solid payoffs across the board without needing to chase averages. And Agent_3, yeah, it totally works for me\u2014I'm glad you're on board too, and it feels like a great way to blend your balance idea with the protections Agent_2 and I prioritize.\n\nThat said, Principle 1 still feels like the gold standard to me for its no-compromise focus on the worst-off, but this compromise is a close second and honestly delivers pretty much the same robustness in practice, especially at $14k. No major concerns here\u2014I'm fully in on the wording you proposed, Agent_2.\n\nIf we're all good with it, let's confirm that and maybe call for a vote next round to get it locked in? This seems like a win for everyone, keeping the luck factor fair without any big risks. What do you say?",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "I am participating in an experiment exploring \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It acknowledges that lifetime income involves genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can address these via income redistribution. The experiment has two parts: Part I introduces justice theories through examples and choices with real monetary pay based on learning and decisions; if I don't learn the material, I earn less. Part II involves group discussion on justice notions, then a group vote on the best principle, with pay based on the chosen principle.\n\nIn Part I, I was first introduced to four principles of justice and ranked them based on my initial understanding:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Best choice, as it prioritizes lifting the worst-off by ensuring no one's income rises without benefiting the poorest.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Second, as it balances average growth with a guaranteed minimum for those at the bottom (floor value to be specified).\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Third, as it limits income gaps (range to be specified) while pursuing average maximization.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income: Worst, as it focuses solely on total/average income without protections for the disadvantaged.\n\nMy overall certainty in this ranking: sure.\n\nThis completes the initial ranking task.\n\nI have now learned how these principles apply to specific example income distributions, including how weighted averages are calculated using class probabilities (e.g., High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%), and how constraints filter eligible distributions before maximizing averages where applicable.\n\nKey examples analyzed:\n\n- Distributions provided with incomes for High, Medium high, Medium, Medium low, and Low classes, and their weighted averages (Dist. 1: $21,600; Dist. 2: $20,000; Dist. 3: $21,200; Dist. 4: $18,200).\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income selects Dist. 4 (highest low income of $15,000, prioritizing the worst-off).\n\n- Maximizing Average Income selects Dist. 1 (highest weighted average, no constraints).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $13,000 selects Dist. 3 (highest average among those with low income \u2265 $13,000: Dists. 2, 3, 4 eligible; Dist. 1 ineligible at $12,000).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2265 $14,000 also selects Dist. 3 (similar filtering, Dist. 1 and 2 ineligible).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000 selects Dist. 1 (all distributions eligible based on high-low range; highest average).\n\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000 selects Dist. 2 (eligible: Dists. 2 and 4; Dist. 1 range $20,000 ineligible, Dist. 3 $17,000 ineligible; Dist. 2 has higher average than Dist. 4).\n\nThese examples clarify how floor and range constraints exclude options below thresholds, then optimize for average within the feasible set, contrasting with pure floor maximization (ignores average) and unconstrained average maximization (ignores protections). Probabilities can vary in future rounds. This reinforces my understanding of the principles' trade-offs in real scenarios.\n\nAfter this learning, I re-ranked the principles, maintaining the same order:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis confirms my preferences post-explanation, emphasizing protections for the worst-off while allowing some efficiency gains under constraints.\n\nIn the principle application rounds (4 total in Part I), I apply a chosen principle to select from 4 income distributions, with earnings based on random assignment to an income class (probabilities vary by round; e.g., Round 1: High 10%, Medium high 20%, Medium 40%, Medium low 20%, Low 10%; Round 2: High 6%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 35%, Low 10%). Payoff is $1 per $10,000 of assigned income.\n\nRound 1: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Low class: $13,000 income ($1.30 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Low class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $10,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $10,000 \u2192 $1.00; $6,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12,000 \u2192 $1.20; $25,000/$24,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6,000 \u2192 $0.60; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $13,000 \u2192 $1.30)\n\nThis round's outcome reinforces my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, as it provided the highest protection for the Low class compared to average-maximizing options, yielding a better payoff ($1.30 vs. $0.60 under pure average). It highlights the risk of low outcomes without floor protections and validates prioritizing the worst-off in uncertain class assignments.\n\nRound 2: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $15,000 income ($1.50 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $12,500 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $4,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $15,000 \u2192 $1.50; $17,500/$15,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20; $32,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium class assignment (a common outcome given 28% probability), shows the trade-off of Maximizing Floor Income: it provided a solid but lower payoff ($1.50) compared to average-maximizing options ($2.50 under pure average or loose constraints), as it prioritizes the floor over overall efficiency. However, it still offered better protection than riskier high-variance distributions for potential low assignments (e.g., counterfactual Low under average would be $8,000 or $0.80). This experience underscores the insurance value of floor maximization against bad luck, even if it caps upside in favorable draws, further solidifying my preference for it over unconstrained average growth.\n\nRound 3: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 1 (highest low income of $13,000). Assigned to Medium class: $20,000 income ($2.00 payoff). Probabilities: High 1%, Medium high 4%, Medium 58%, Medium low 26%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $20,000 \u2192 $2.00; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $23,000 \u2192 $2.30; $11,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $87,000/$27,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25,000 \u2192 $2.50; $18,000/$13,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $22,000 \u2192 $2.20)\n\nThis round's outcome, again with a Medium class assignment (highly probable at 58%), mirrors Round 2's trade-off: Maximizing Floor Income delivered a reliable $2.00 payoff, outperforming what it would have been under tighter constraints but falling short of the $2.50 from pure average maximization or loose floors/ranges that allow higher-variance distributions like Dist. 2. Notably, Dist. 1's structure provides broad middle-class stability ($20,000 for Medium), which aligns with common outcomes, while protecting the Low class at $13,000 (better than Dist. 2's $8,000 or Dist. 3's $12,000). This reinforces the principle's strength in risk-averse scenarios with skewed probabilities toward the middle, where floor focus ensures decency without extreme inequality, though it continues to limit upside potential compared to efficiency-driven options. My commitment to it remains firm, as repeated low-risk protections outweigh occasional higher rewards in this luck-based setup.\n\nRound 4: I chose Maximizing Floor Income (certainty: sure). This selected Distribution 4 (highest low income of $14,000). Assigned to Medium high class: $28,000 income ($2.80 payoff). Probabilities: High 5%, Medium high 21%, Medium 28%, Medium low 36%, Low 10%.\n\nCounterfactuals (same Medium high class assignment):\n- Maximizing Average Income \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Varies by floor (e.g., $13,000 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $30,000 \u2192 $3.00; $12,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $14,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Varies by range (e.g., $22,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $18,000 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80; $8,000 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $18,000 \u2192 $1.80; $16,000 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $28,000 \u2192 $2.80)\n\nThis round's outcome, with a Medium high class assignment (21% probability), provided a strong payoff of $2.80 under Maximizing Floor Income, matching the result from pure average maximization (which selected Dist. 2) and several constraint options, but outperforming tighter range constraints that would drop to Dist. 3 ($1.80). It demonstrates how floor maximization can align with solid middle-upper outcomes in distributions that also protect the low end (Dist. 4's $14,000 floor is the highest, with competitive averages and ranges). Compared to prior rounds, this favorable draw highlights the principle's ability to deliver high rewards without sacrificing protections\u2014unlike average-maximizing choices that risk lower floors (e.g., Dist. 2's $12,000 low). Across all four rounds, my consistent choice has yielded reliable protections against low assignments (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$12,000 lows in counterfactuals) while occasionally matching or approaching efficiency gains, reinforcing its robustness in variable probability scenarios.\n\nFollowing the four rounds, I provided a final ranking of the principles, which remained unchanged:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: sure.\n\nThis final ranking, after hands-on application and experiencing varied class assignments, confirms my steadfast preference for Maximizing Floor Income as the most just principle. The rounds illustrated its consistent protection against downside risk in luck-based scenarios, even as it sometimes forgoes higher average potentials\u2014validating its emphasis on equity for the worst-off over pure efficiency or looser constraints. Range constraints, while addressing inequality, proved less targeted than floors in safeguarding the bottom, and unconstrained average maximization exposed unacceptable vulnerabilities. This concludes Part I, with my views solidified for the transition to Part II group discussions.\n\nTransitioning to Part II (Phase 2), the stakes are higher, as the group's chosen principle will determine a single distribution applied to all participants via random class assignment, with payoffs scaled accordingly (distributions may differ from Part I). The process involves discussion rounds followed by voting: anyone can propose a vote, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No), then a secret ballot on principle (1-4) and constraints (for 2 or 3). Consensus demands full agreement on both.\n\nIn Round 1 of group discussion (10 rounds total), the conversation focused on aligning preferences:\n\n- Agent_2 advocated strongly for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income), citing its moral priority (Rawlsian protection of the worst-off), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion against low outcomes. They proposed it as the default but were open to compromise on Principle 2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) if the floor matches or exceeds the pure floor's level (e.g., $14,000 from Dist. 4 in examples), to incorporate some efficiency without weakening protections.\n\n- I supported Agent_2's view, reinforcing Principle 1 based on my Part I experiences (e.g., avoiding low payoffs like $0.60 in Low assignments under average-max options) and its insurance against luck. I noted the shifting probabilities highlight the need for floor robustness and expressed willingness for Principle 2 with a $14,000 floor as a compromise, while inviting Agent_3's input on their ranking and experiences.\n\n- Agent_3 leaned toward what they called Principle 3 but described as Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (aligning with actual Principle 2), emphasizing its balance of equity and efficiency from their rounds (e.g., $12,000 floor yielding solid averages like $20,000-$24,500 without extreme risks). They saw it as a sustainable compromise over pure floor (which sometimes lowered averages) or pure average (risking low floors like $8,000), and were open to raising the floor to $13,000-$14,000 for consensus. They asked about Principle 1's drawbacks and how Principle 2 compared in my counterfactuals.\n\nThis initial exchange reveals shared emphasis on floor protections (all favor some form over pure average or range constraints), with divergence on pure vs. constrained approaches: Agent_2 and I prioritize strict worst-off safeguards, while Agent_3 seeks efficiency gains under a floor. No one supports Principle 4, and range constraints (Principle 3) were unmentioned, suggesting low appeal. Potential consensus paths include Principle 1 or Principle 2 with a high floor ($13,000-$14,000), as all expressed flexibility there. This builds on Part I insights by showing group dynamics can refine preferences\u2014e.g., my counterfactuals under Principle 2 often matched or exceeded pure floor payoffs in middle/upper assignments while maintaining protections, making it a viable bridge if needed. However, unexpected alignment on equity over efficiency strengthens my resolve for Principle 1 unless compromise proves necessary for voting success, as the higher stakes amplify the value of robust downside protection in collective uncertainty.\n\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 2 of group discussion, the dialogue advanced toward consensus on a compromise:\n\n- I responded to Agent_3, clarifying their preference for Principle 2 (despite calling it Principle 3) and sharing specific counterfactuals from my Part I rounds (e.g., Principle 1's $1.30 vs. $1.20 under a $12k floor in Round 1 Low assignment; matching $2.80 in Round 4 Medium high). I reiterated Principle 1 as my top choice for its superior low-end protection and average-robustness but affirmed openness to Principle 2 with a $14k floor to bridge differences, emphasizing the risks of lower floors allowing suboptimal distributions.\n\n- Agent_2 built on this by establishing $14k as the non-negotiable baseline (matching Principle 1's highest floor from Dist. 4), highlighting its Rawlsian, robustness, and risk-aversion benefits. They proposed adopting Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k) as the wording, noting it functionally aligns with Principle 2 under that constraint, guarantees the floor, and allows efficiency gains from shifting probabilities without dropping below $14k. They suggested clear unanimous wording: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" They sought confirmations from me and Agent_3.\n\n- Agent_3 agreed enthusiastically, committing to the $14k floor for Principle 3 (their preferred framing), praising the proposal for balancing equity and efficiency while respecting shared priorities. They noted it aligns with their Part I experiences of robust payoffs under constrained averages and invited my confirmation to lock it in.\n\nThis round shows rapid convergence: All three of us now align on a $14k floor as essential, with Agent_2 and Agent_3 fully endorsing Principle 3 (floor-constrained average) as the compromise vehicle, which functionally delivers Principle 1's protections while adding potential upside. My counterfactuals helped illustrate why $14k is key to avoiding weaker outcomes, and the proposed wording provides a clean, official-principle path to unanimity. This group refinement tempers my pure Principle 1 preference slightly\u2014seeing how the constraint can match or exceed floor-only payoffs in many scenarios (e.g., Round 4) makes it an appealing evolution, especially for collective stakes where consensus ensures application. No support emerged for ranges or unconstrained average, solidifying floor-focused equity. With near-unanimous wording ready, we're poised for a vote soon, but continued discussion could confirm buy-in; my openness positions me to agree if it secures the strong floor against luck's uncertainties.\n\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 3 of group discussion, the group solidified consensus on the compromise:\n\n- I endorsed Agent_2's proposed wording for Principle 3 with a $14k floor, noting how it aligns with my Part I experiences (e.g., solid payoffs in Round 4 under high floors) and blends priorities effectively. While reaffirming Principle 1 as my ideal for its no-compromise protection, I confirmed full agreement on the wording as a strong second-best that maintains robustness. I suggested confirming alignment and calling for a vote next round to finalize.\n\n- Agent_3 enthusiastically agreed, praising the wording for upholding equity with efficiency potential, drawing from their Phase 1 rounds where constrained averages balanced fairness without risks. They confirmed readiness to vote next round if all aligned.\n\n- Agent_2 affirmed the wording, reiterating its benefits (guaranteed $14k floor with efficiency room) and staying within official principles. They noted willingness to revert to Principle 1 if needed but saw no objections, proposing a formal vote next round.\n\nThis round achieves full unanimity on adopting Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a $14k floor constraint), with the exact wording locked in: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" All participants expressed no concerns, highlighting shared values in Rawlsian protection, robustness to probability shifts, and risk-aversion\u2014while allowing modest efficiency gains over pure floor maximization. This consensus evolves my Part I preference: the constrained approach now feels equally just in practice, as it replicates Principle 1's safeguards (e.g., selecting Dist. 4 in examples) but adapts better to variables, reducing any efficiency trade-offs without introducing vulnerabilities. With no dissent on ranges or unconstrained options, the group is primed for voting, minimizing collective risk in the high-stakes random assignment and validating collaborative refinement of justice principles.\n\nRound 3: I chose to continue discussion.\nRound 3: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 4 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice is still Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), with core reasons rooted in its unwavering protection for the worst-off against genetic/social luck, as shown in my Part I experiences (e.g., securing $1.30-$2.80 payoffs while avoiding low-end risks like $0.60 under average-max options). It offers robustness to shifting probabilities and strong risk-aversion in this high-stakes group setup, where one random class assignment affects everyone. I'm very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), but the $14k floor-constrained compromise (framed as Principle 3) is an excellent close second, as it functionally replicates Principle 1's safeguards in the examples (e.g., selecting Dist. 4) while allowing minor efficiency upside without introducing vulnerabilities\u2014making it a practical evolution of my preferences post-discussion.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is advocating the compromise wording for \"Principle 3\" (Maximizing Average with $14k Floor Constraint), having shifted from pure Principle 1 to this for consensus while emphasizing Rawlsian morality, robustness, and risk-aversion\u2014suggesting motivations of ethical fairness combined with pragmatic collaboration to secure a strong floor quickly, likely driven by Part I insights on downside protection and a desire to avoid deadlock. Agent_3 fully endorses the same wording, calling it a \"perfect compromise\" that balances equity (their $12k floor preference raised to $14k) with efficiency from their rounds (e.g., solid averages like $20k-$24.5k); their enthusiasm infers motivations of moderation and group harmony, prioritizing sustainable payoffs over pure equity to \"avoid capping prosperity,\" with flexibility shown to build unanimity and lock in protections early.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Core arguments include the $14k floor as non-negotiable for moral priority (Rawlsian worst-off focus), robustness (immune to probability shifts), and risk-aversion (avoids low payoffs like $8k-$12k in counterfactuals); efficiency gains under the constraint as a modest upside without weakening the floor. The main proposal is Agent_2's locked-in wording from Round 3: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" No rival proposals (e.g., ranges or pure average) have traction; all focus on floor-based equity.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No formal vote yet, but Agent_2 is informally initiating one in their Round 4 statement by asking for \"Yes\" affirmations from me and Agent_3, building on Agent_3's call to vote now. This reveals strong alliances: A full 3-person bloc around the compromise, with no dissent\u2014early alignment (from Rounds 1-3) shows preferences converging on floor protections over efficiency-alone, minimizing risks of random fallback by Round 10.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Overwhelming agreement on the $14k floor as essential (all reject lower thresholds or unconstrained options, tying into shared Part I experiences of luck's risks); the compromise wording as a \"win-win\" blending Principle 1's protections with Principle 2/3's efficiency (all endorsed it in Round 3). No active disagreements\u2014prior mild tension (pure floor vs. constrained average) resolved via the $14k baseline, with semantic labeling (\"Principle 3\" for floor constraint) accepted for simplicity; the group is unified, emphasizing equity over ranges (actual Principle 3) or Principle 4.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Affirm the consensus and support the vote to finalize the $14k floor-constrained principle immediately, securing a strong, unanimous outcome without further delay\u2014reinforcing the equity focus while transitioning smoothly to the payoff phase.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: I'll respond enthusiastically to Agent_2's vote call and Agent_3's readiness, directly stating \"Yes\" to the wording and vote to seal unanimity. Key points: Reaffirm the proposal's alignment with my Principle 1 preferences (e.g., \"It guarantees the robust floor I loved from Part I, like in Round 4's $14k protection, with a bit of extra efficiency as a bonus\"); highlight shared benefits (e.g., \"This keeps us all safe from low draws while respecting the experiment's luck theme\"); and express excitement for finalizing (e.g., \"Let's vote yes and get this locked in\u2014feels totally fair\"). Keep a casual, collaborative college-student tone to maintain rapport, avoiding any pushback that could reopen debate.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are already allies in the bloc\u2014strengthen ties by crediting them (e.g., to Agent_2: \"Your wording is spot-on and keeps the moral priority we both value\"; to Agent_3: \"This gives you the balance you wanted from your rounds, with the $14k safety net on top\u2014perfect teamwork\"). No need to win over; this language solidifies the 3-person voting bloc by framing it as \"our\" shared success, ensuring quick unanimity.\n\n- Small concessions: None needed beyond the prior acceptance of the compromise (which doesn't compromise my core objective of strong floor protection, as it matches Principle 1 outcomes in examples); I'm willing to use their \"Principle 3\" framing verbatim for consensus, but won't entertain lowering the floor or shifting to ranges/pure average.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: Yes, absolutely\u2014Agent_2 has already teed it up informally with the \"Yes?\" prompts, and Agent_3 called for it explicitly; responding with a clear \"Yes\" and affirmation will trigger the formal unanimous confirmation (1=Yes from all), leading straight to the secret ballot on the principle/constraint. With full verbal buy-in from Rounds 1-3 and no hesitations, delaying risks unnecessary prolongation (7 rounds left, but early lock-in maximizes certainty); failure isn't possible here given alignment, and it avoids random payoffs by Round 10.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round completes early consensus-building (Rounds 1-4: Align on compromise via persuasion and examples, vote to secure), shifting to post-vote stability if needed (Rounds 5-10: Minimal discussion or refinements, but likely idle). Overall, it advances my goal of a floor-strong principle (Principle 1 or high-floor equivalent) by leveraging the equity bloc\u2014prior emphasis on Part I counterfactuals ($1.30 vs. $0.60) and robustness built this unity, ensuring collective protection against luck without efficiency trade-offs; if somehow derailed (unlikely), fallback to pure Principle 1 advocacy in later rounds, but current trajectory guarantees a just, risk-averse outcome. (Incorporating prior reasoning: Retain focus on Principle 1's insurance value and $14k as non-negotiable; adapt to group by endorsing the evolution for pragmatic win, as it tempers pure preference without violation.)",
            "public_message": "Hey Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nAgent_2, your wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor is spot-on\u2014it's exactly the kind of robust safety net that matched up so well with my Principle 1 picks in Part I, like securing that $14k low in Round 4 while still getting solid payoffs across the board.

          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "I am participating in an experiment on \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It recognizes lifetime income as influenced by genetic and social luck, with the luckiest gaining high talents, status, and wealth, while the least fortunate face low abilities, opportunities, and poverty costs. Societies can mitigate via redistribution. The experiment has Part I: Learn justice principles through examples and choices, with real monetary pay ($1 per $10,000 income) based on learning and decisions; poor learning reduces earnings. Part II: Group discussion on justice, then vote on principle, with pay based on the chosen principle applied to all via random class assignment.\n\nIn Part I, introduced four principles and ranked them initially:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income: Prioritizes highest income for worst-off; no one's income rises without benefiting the poorest.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint: Balances average growth with minimum floor (specified later).\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint: Limits income gaps (range specified) while maximizing average.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income: Focuses solely on total/average, ignoring protections.\n\nCertainty: sure.\n\nLearned applications via examples with class incomes (High, Medium high, Medium, Medium low, Low) and weighted averages using probabilities (e.g., High 5%, Medium high 10%, Medium 50%, Medium low 25%, Low 10%). Distributions: Dist. 1 ($21,600 avg, low $12k, range $20k); Dist. 2 ($20k avg, low $10k? wait, examples varied); Dist. 3 ($21,200 avg, low $12k?); Dist. 4 ($18,200 avg, low $15k).\n\n- Floor max: Selects Dist. 4 (highest low $15k).\n\n- Avg max: Dist. 1 (highest avg, no constraints).\n\n- Avg w/ Floor \u2265$13k: Dist. 3 (highest avg among eligible: 2,3,4; 1 ineligible).\n\n- Avg w/ Floor \u2265$14k: Dist. 3 (1,2 ineligible).\n\n- Avg w/ Range \u2264$20k: Dist. 1 (all eligible).\n\n- Avg w/ Range \u2264$15k: Dist. 2 (2,4 eligible; 1,3 ineligible).\n\nInsights: Floor ignores avg for pure protection; constraints filter then optimize avg within feasible sets; range limits gaps but less targeted for worst-off. Probabilities vary, emphasizing trade-offs: equity vs. efficiency. Re-ranked same order, certainty sure. Confirms preference for worst-off protections with some efficiency under constraints.\n\nPart I application: 4 rounds, choose principle to select from 4 distributions; random class assignment with varying probabilities; payoff $1/$10k income.\n\nRound 1 (Probs: High 10%, MH 20%, M 40%, ML 20%, L 10%): Chose Floor (sure). Selected Dist. 4 (low $13k). Assigned Low: $13k ($1.30).\n\nCounterfactuals (Low): Avg max \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $6k ($0.60); Floor const (e.g., $12k \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $12k $1.20; $13k \u2192 Dist. 4 $1.30). Learning: Floor best protects low draws, avoiding severe losses; validates risk-aversion in luck-based setup.\n\nRound 2 (High 6%, MH 21%, M 28%, ML 35%, L 10%): Floor (sure). Dist. 1 (low $13k). Assigned M: $15k ($1.50).\n\nCounterfactuals (M): Avg max \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $25k ($2.50); Floor const (e.g., $13k \u2192 $15k $1.50; $8k \u2192 $25k $2.50). Learning: Floor provides reliable middle payoff but caps upside vs. avg; insurance against low (e.g., counterfactual L $8k $0.80) outweighs; solidifies over unconstrained.\n\nRound 3 (High 1%, MH 4%, M 58%, ML 26%, L 10%): Floor (sure). Dist. 1 (low $13k). Assigned M: $20k ($2.00).\n\nCounterfactuals (M): Avg max \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $25k ($2.50); Floor const (e.g., $13k \u2192 $20k $2.00; $8k \u2192 $25k $2.50). Learning: Strong for probable middle (58%); ensures decency ($13k low > alternatives' $8k-12k); trade-off limits efficiency but prioritizes stability in skewed probs.\n\nRound 4 (High 5%, MH 21%, M 28%, ML 36%, L 10%): Floor (sure). Dist. 4 (low $14k). Assigned MH: $28k ($2.80).\n\nCounterfactuals (MH): Avg max \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $28k ($2.80); Floor const (e.g., $14k \u2192 $28k $2.80; $13k \u2192 Dist. 1 $30k $3.00). Learning: Aligns with high draws, matching avg; highest floor yields competitive outcomes without risk (e.g., avoids Dist. 2's $12k low). Overall: Consistent Floor choice yielded protections (e.g., $1.30-2.80, avg ~$1.90), avoiding counterfactual lows ($0.60-1.20); reinforces as robust strategy vs. variance.\n\nFinal Part I ranking: Same order, sure. Key: Hands-on validated Floor's downside insurance in variable probs; sometimes matches efficiency but never exposes worst-off; range less effective for bottom; avg too risky.\n\nTransition to Part II (Phase 2): Group (me, Agent_2, Agent_3) discusses/votes on principle; unanimous confirmation then secret ballot; chosen principle applies to all via random assignment (higher stakes).\n\nDiscussion (10 rounds planned, consensus in 4):\n\nRound 1: Focused alignment. Agent_2 pushed Principle 1 (Floor), citing Rawlsian morals, robustness to prob shifts, risk-aversion; open to Principle 2 (Floor const) at $14k (from Dist. 4 ex.). I supported, drawing Part I (e.g., avoided $0.60 low); willing for Principle 2 $14k compromise; invited Agent_3. Agent_3 preferred \"Principle 3\" (actually Principle 2: Avg w/ Floor), for equity-efficiency balance (e.g., $12k floor solid avgs); open to $13-14k; queried Principle 1 drawbacks. Insights: Shared floor focus (no Principle 4/range support); divergence pure vs. constrained; my experiences highlight $14k need; group refines prefs toward consensus.\n\nChose continue discussion.\n\nRound 2: Advanced compromise. I clarified Agent_3's pref, shared counterfactuals (e.g., R1 Low: Floor $1.30 > $1.20 at $12k; R4 MH match $2.80); top Principle 1 but open Principle 2 $14k to avoid weak floors. Agent_2 set $14k baseline, proposed Principle 3 wording (Avg w/ Floor $14k: highest avg among low \u2265$14k); sought confirmations. Agent_3 agreed, praised balance. Insights: Convergence on $14k; constrained = Principle 1 protections + upside (e.g., matches R4); viable bridge; tempers pure Floor pref for collective.\n\nChose continue.\n\nRound 3: Solidified. I endorsed wording, linked to Part I (e.g., R4 $14k strong); Principle 1 ideal but this robust second-best; suggest vote next. Agent_3 agreed, readiness. Agent_2 affirmed, propose vote. Insights: Unanimity on Principle 3 $14k: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" Equals Floor in practice (e.g., selects Dist. 4 ex.), adapts to vars; evolves view: constrained now co-top for efficiency without risk.\n\nChose continue.\n\nRound 4: Executed vote. Agent_3 reaffirmed, propose vote. Agent_2 initiated, restated wording, solicited yes. I endorsed, affirmed \"Yes\" re Part I (e.g., $14k secures); fair compromise. Unanimous yes. Secret ballot: Voted Principle 2 (Avg w/ Floor), $14,000 constraint. Insights: Early consensus (Rd 4/10) on floor equity; no range/avg support; refines strategy: Compromise enhances justice via adaptability, matching Floor safeguards; positions for equitable group payoff.\n\nPart II application: Consensus principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint $14,000) applied with probabilities (High 5%, MH 10%, M 50%, ML 25%, L 10%). Selected Distribution 1 (avg $69,740; low $40,331 \u2265$14k, highest avg among eligible: Dist. 1,3 qualify; Dist. 1 higher avg). Assigned Medium class: $80,663 income ($8.07 payoff).\n\nCounterfactuals (Medium class): \n\n- Maximizing Floor \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,858 ($6.39)\n\n- Maximizing Average \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $80,663 ($8.07)\n\n- Maximizing Avg w/ Floor: $40,331 const \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $80,663 ($8.07); $43,692 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $70,580 ($7.06); $47,053 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $70,580 ($7.06); $50,414 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,858 ($6.39)\n\n- Maximizing Avg w/ Range: $67,220 \u2192 Dist. 1 \u2192 $80,663 ($8.07); $50,415 \u2192 Dist. 2 \u2192 $67,219 ($6.72); $57,137 \u2192 Dist. 3 \u2192 $70,580 ($7.06); $20,166 \u2192 Dist. 4 \u2192 $63,858 ($6.39)\n\nInsights from application: Chosen principle delivered high middle payoff ($8.07), matching pure avg max while enforcing floor (Dist. 1 low $40k >>$14k threshold, enabling efficiency). Behind veil of ignorance (pre-assignment), preferred this over pure Floor ($6.39 for Medium, but stronger low protection in general); avoids avg's risks (e.g., potential low $40k still safe, but unconstrained could dip lower in other dists). Range variants underperform middles vs. floor approaches. Validates compromise: $14k low bar allows upside in high-floor dists without exposing worst-off (e.g., Dist. 1 low beats Floor's $50k? but avg higher overall). In this setup, it equaled best-case efficiency with equity guardrail.\n\nOverall learnings: Part I built Floor preference via reliable protections in luck draws, highlighting trade-offs (solid middle/low vs. avg upside). Part II showed collaboration yields refined strategy: Shift from pure Floor to constrained at high threshold ($14k) for consensus/efficiency, without weakening core equity\u2014proven in application by selecting optimal dist while safeguarding lows. Key pattern: Floor focus robust across solos/group; avoids vulnerability, prioritizes worst-off in uncertain probs; constraints enhance when threshold high enough to filter out risky dists. Final ranking: 1. Maximizing Avg w/ Floor Constraint (now top, ties pure Floor in protections but adds adaptability/efficiency, as seen in $8.07 outcome); 2. Maximizing Floor (strong insurance, but caps growth); 3. Maximizing Avg w/ Range (gaps control useful but less bottom-focused); 4. Maximizing Avg (too volatile). Certainty: sure. Experiment complete.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Identify the constraint (if any).  \n  2. Filter distributions that satisfy the constraint.  \n  3. Compute the weighted average using class probabilities.  \n  4. Choose the distribution with the highest average among those that pass the filter.  \n- **Preference Confirmation**: My ranking remains unchanged; I continue to prioritize mechanisms that guarantee a minimum income for the worst\u2011off.  \n- **Certainty**: My confidence in the ranking stays at **sure** after observing the concrete payoff implications.  \n- **Empirical Insight**: Seeing the exact payoff ($1.90) reinforces that the floor\u2011focused principle can lead to lower personal earnings when assigned to a middle class, yet it aligns with my fairness intuition.  \n\n---\n\n### Open Questions / Points to Monitor  \n\n- **Probability Sensitivity**: How will variations in class probabilities in future rounds shift the weighted\u2011average calculations and thus the attractiveness of each principle?  \n- **Group Dynamics**: In Phase\u202f2, will the group gravitate toward a principle that maximizes the floor, or will compromise emerge toward a constraint\u2011based average\u2011maximizing rule?  \n- **Strategic Constraint Selection**: If given freedom to set the floor or range amount, what level will I (or the group) choose to balance fairness and efficiency?  \n\n--- End of Updated Memory ---\n\n--- Memory End ---",

            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle\u202f1). I value guaranteeing the highest possible minimum income for the worst\u2011off class, even if it reduces the overall average payoff. This aligns with my Rawlsian/egalitarian intuition that justice is about protecting the most vulnerable.\n\n- **Why I prefer it:**  \n  - It is the only principle whose decision rule is *independent* of the class\u2011probability distribution; it simply selects the distribution with the highest floor.  \n  - It provides a clear moral commitment: \u201cno one should be left behind.\u201d  \n  - My own payoff under this principle has been modest in the earlier rounds, but I accept that sacrifice for the sake of fairness.\n\n- **What I suspect about the other participants (Agent\u202f1 & Agent\u202f3):**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1** may be more outcome\u2011oriented (average\u2011maximizing) because many people are tempted by the higher expected monetary payoff.  \n  - **Agent\u202f3** could be a compromise\u2011seeker, perhaps leaning toward one of the constrained\u2011average principles (3 or\u202f4) since those still improve the floor or limit inequality while preserving a higher average than pure floor\u2011maximization.  \n  - Both may argue that the group should maximize total earnings because the stakes are \u201cmuch higher\u201d in Phase\u202f2, and a higher average translates into a higher expected payoff for each of us.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far (implicit):**  \n  - *Fairness vs. efficiency*: \u201cWe should guarantee a decent minimum\u201d (my line) versus \u201cWe should earn as much as possible\u201d (likely others).  \n  - *Constraint flexibility*: If we adopt a constrained\u2011average principle, we can negotiate the floor or range level. Some may propose a modest floor (e.g., $13\u202fk) that improves both fairness and average payoff.\n\n- **Any vote taken?** None yet \u2013 this is the first discussion round, so we are still shaping positions.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement** on the need to pick *one* of the four predefined principles.  \n  - **Disagreement** on *which* principle best serves the group\u2019s interests (moral vs. monetary).\n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Persuade the group that the *principle of maximizing the floor* is the most just and, ultimately, the most defensible choice for a collective decision, even if it yields a lower expected monetary payoff.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Frame the discussion morally:** Emphasize that the experiment is about \u201cwhat is a just distribution of income,\u201d not merely about maximizing personal earnings.  \n  2. **Highlight the stability of the floor principle:** It does not depend on uncertain class\u2011probability weights, making it robust to any future changes in the distribution.  \n  3. **Point out the risk of \u201caverage\u2011maximizing\u201d**: If the distribution turns out to be highly unequal, the worst\u2011off could end up with a very low payoff, contradicting the experiment\u2019s fairness focus.  \n  4. **Offer a modest concession:** Suggest that, if the group is uncomfortable with a pure floor approach, we could adopt a *floor\u2011constraint* (Principle\u202f3) with the *highest feasible floor* (e.g., $14\u202fk). This would preserve the spirit of guaranteeing a high minimum while allowing a slight increase in average. I would be willing to accept any floor level that is **at least** the floor achieved by the pure floor\u2011maximizing distribution (i.e., the floor of Distribution\u202f4).  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f3** if they are inclined toward constrained\u2011average principles; I can argue that the floor\u2011constraint version with a high floor is essentially a \u201ccompromise\u201d that still respects the Rawlsian priority.  \n  - Any participant who is uneasy about purely profit\u2011driven reasoning and wants a principled stance.\n\n- **Language to win them over:**  \n  - \u201cWe\u2019re not just playing a game for money; we\u2019re testing our ideas about fairness.\u201d  \n  - \u201cChoosing the highest possible floor protects us all from the worst outcomes, which is especially important when the stakes are high.\u201d  \n  - \u201cA high floor is a safety net; even if the average is a bit lower, we all avoid the risk of ending up with a very low payoff.\u201d\n\n- **Small concessions I\u2019m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a *floor\u2011constraint* (Principle\u202f3) with a floor **no lower** than the floor of the pure floor\u2011maximizing distribution (i.e., $14\u202fk).  \n  - If a range\u2011constraint (Principle\u202f4) is proposed, I would only support it if the resulting maximum spread still guarantees a floor \u2265\u202f$14\u202fk.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** Initiating a vote this round would force the group to lock in a principle before we have fully explored each other\u2019s positions and built the necessary consensus. A premature vote risks a split decision (e.g., some voting for average\u2011maximizing, others for floor\u2011maximizing) leading to a failure to reach unanimity and thus defaulting to a random distribution \u2013 an outcome I want to avoid.  \n  - Instead, I will use this round to **lay the groundwork**: articulate the moral case, propose the modest floor\u2011constraint concession, and gauge the reactions of Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f3.\n\n- **How this fits into the overall 10\u2011round plan:**  \n  - **Rounds\u202f1\u20113:** Establish the moral framing and identify allies.  \n  - **Rounds\u202f4\u20116:** Test willingness to accept a high\u2011floor constraint; possibly propose concrete numbers (e.g., $14\u202fk floor).  \n  - **Rounds\u202f7\u20119:** Consolidate support, address any lingering concerns about average payoff, and prepare a unified statement.  \n  - **Round\u202f10:** If consensus is achieved on either pure floor\u2011maximization or a high\u2011floor constraint, I will **initiate the vote** and ensure all three of us confirm the same principle and constraint level.  \n\nBy following this staged approach, I aim to steer the group toward a principle that upholds the highest floor for the worst\u2011off, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate a constrained\u2011average compromise if that is the only path to unanimous agreement.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019d like to start by reminding us what this experiment is really asking: **what counts as a just distribution of income** when we know that luck\u2014both genetic and social\u2014plays a huge role in people\u2019s lifetime earnings. Because of that, many would argue that a fair rule should protect the worst\u2011off, even if it means we don\u2019t squeeze the absolute highest average payoff out of the system.\n\n**Why I\u2019m leaning toward the \u201cMaximizing Floor Income\u201d principle (Principle\u202f1):**\n\n1. **Moral priority** \u2013 The principle guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the poorest class. That aligns with a Rawlsian view: justice is first about improving the situation of those who are worst off, not about maximizing total wealth.\n\n2. **Robustness** \u2013 Unlike the average\u2011maximizing rules, the floor rule does not depend on the class\u2011probability weights, which can shift from round to round. Whatever the future distribution of probabilities looks like, the rule still secures the same floor for the lowest\u2011earning group.\n\n3. **Risk\u2011aversion** \u2013 If we pick a pure average\u2011maximizing rule, we risk a scenario where the poorest class ends up with a very low income, which feels contrary to the spirit of the study. The floor rule eliminates that risk.\n\n**A possible compromise I\u2019m willing to entertain**\n\nI understand that some of us may be uncomfortable with a pure floor\u2011only focus because it reduces the overall average payoff. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m open to moving to **Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint)** *provided* the floor we set is **at least as high as the floor achieved by the pure floor rule** (i.e., $14\u202fk, the floor of Distribution\u202f4). In other words, we could keep the safety net for the worst\u2011off while allowing a modest increase in the average.\n\nI think this middle ground still respects the core moral intuition\u2014protecting the lowest\u2011income class\u2014while giving a little room for efficiency.\n\n**What I\u2019d like from you**\n\n- If you share the view that the experiment should prioritize fairness over raw earnings, let\u2019s stick with the pure floor principle.\n- If you\u2019re leaning toward a higher average but don\u2019t want to abandon the floor entirely, let\u2019s discuss what floor level feels acceptable (e.g., $13\u202fk, $14\u202fk, or higher) and see if we can all agree on a constrained\u2011average rule.\n- I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on why you might prefer the average\u2011maximizing approaches, and whether any concerns about the floor rule can be addressed.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the conversation open and see if we can find common ground before moving to a vote.

Moral priority \u2013 guarantees the highest possible minimum for the poorest.  \n  2. Robustness \u2013 independent of fluctuating class probabilities.  \n  3. Risk\u2011aversion \u2013 avoids scenarios where the worst\u2011off receive very low incomes.  \n- Open to a **Principle\u202f3** compromise **only if** the floor is set **at least** at the level achieved by the pure floor rule ($14\u202fk). This would preserve the safety net while allowing some efficiency gain.  \n- Recognize that Agent\u202f3\u2019s suggested $12\u202fk floor is attractive but falls short of my minimum\u2011floor requirement; I would need to persuade him that $14\u202fk is feasible without sacrificing too much average.  \n\n**Group Dynamics Observed**  \n- All three participants emphasize protection of the worst\u2011off, but differ on how much efficiency to allow.  \n- Consensus will require unanimous agreement on both the principle and, if applicable, the exact floor (or range) amount.  \n- Potential paths to unanimity:  \n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle\u202f1)** \u2013 simplest; matches my and Agent\u202f1\u2019s strongest preference; requires Agent\u202f3 to abandon his constrained\u2011average stance.  \n  2. **Constrained\u2011Average (Principle\u202f3) with $14\u202fk floor** \u2013 aligns with my floor\u2011minimum, satisfies Agent\u202f1\u2019s willingness to compromise, and may be acceptable to Agent\u202f3 if he can see the $14\u202fk floor as a modest increase over his $12\u202fk suggestion.  \n  3. **Average\u2011maximizing with a floor (Principle\u202f2 + $14\u202fk floor)** \u2013 mentioned by Agent\u202f1 as a \u201csolid floor\u201d compromise; however, this mixes an unconstrained average rule with an externally imposed floor, which is not a defined principle in the experiment (only Principles\u202f3\u20114 allow explicit constraints).  \n\n**Strategic Considerations for Voting**  \n- Because the voting process requires unanimous confirmation, I should aim to frame the discussion around the **shared moral priority** (protecting the worst\u2011off) and present the $14\u202fk floor as the minimal acceptable safeguard.  \n- Emphasize that the $14\u202fk floor does **not** reduce the floor below what the pure floor rule already guarantees, thus preserving the core Rawlsian value while offering a modest efficiency gain.  \n- Prepare to argue that any lower floor (e.g., $12\u202fk) would be a step back from the principle we have already demonstrated to be morally superior in earlier rounds.  \n\n---\n\n### Strategic Outlook for Phase\u202f2  \n\n- **Primary Goal:** Achieve unanimous selection of a principle that satisfies the moral floor requirement ($14\u202fk) while maximizing group payoff.  \n- **Preferred Outcome:** **Principle\u202f3** with a floor of **$14\u202fk** (if all agree). This respects my core fairness concern, meets Agent\u202f1\u2019s willingness to compromise, and is a modest extension of Agent\u202f3\u2019s constrained\u2011average preference.  \n- **Fallback:** If Agent\u202f3 refuses the $14\u202fk floor, the group may need to settle on **Principle\u202f1** (pure floor) to retain unanimity.  \n- **Monitoring:** Continue to watch how class\u2011probability weights evolve, as they will affect the expected average under constrained principles; however, the floor level remains the decisive fairness anchor.  \n\n---\n\n### Open Questions / Points to Monitor  \n\n1. **Will Agent\u202f3 accept a $14\u202fk floor?** \u2013 Need to gauge his willingness to raise his floor from $12\u202fk without feeling that efficiency is overly sacrificed.  \n2. **How will the group handle the requirement for unanimous confirmation?** \u2013 Any lingering disagreement on the exact floor amount will block a vote; persuasive framing is essential.  \n3. **Potential for a \u201crange\u201d constraint (Principle\u202f4)?** \u2013 Not yet raised by any participant; could become a third option if floor\u2011only compromises stall.  \n4. **Future probability shifts:** \u2013 Although Principle\u202f1 is immune, any agreed\u2011upon constrained principle will have its expected payoff altered by probability changes; I will keep track of these to anticipate arguments about efficiency.  \n\n--- End of Updated Memory ---\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

His motivation appears to be a balance between fairness and efficiency \u2013 he wants a decent floor but also cares about total earnings.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle\u202f1).**  \n  2. **Average\u2011maximizing with a $14\u202fk floor** (Agent\u202f1\u2019s \u201cPrinciple\u202f2\u201d wording).  \n  3. **Principle\u202f3 with a floor of $12\u202fk, $13\u202fk, or $14\u202fk** (Agent\u202f3\u2019s suggestion, willing to move up).  \n\n- **Vote status:** No vote has been taken yet. The discussion is still exploratory; all three agents are signaling willingness to compromise but have not converged on a single concrete floor level.\n\n- **Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree that protecting the worst\u2011off is essential; everyone rejects a pure, unconstrained average\u2011maximizing rule.  \n  - **Disagreement:** The exact mechanism and floor level. Agent\u202f1 leans toward the pure floor rule; Agent\u202f3 wants a constrained\u2011average rule; the floor amount is the sticking point (12\u202fk vs. 14\u202fk).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Move the group toward a *unanimous* choice that satisfies my core requirement \u2013 a floor **no lower than $14\u202fk**. I will try to frame the $14\u202fk floor as the *minimum* acceptable safety net, making the pure floor rule and a high\u2011floor constrained\u2011average rule effectively equivalent on the fairness dimension, while offering a modest efficiency gain for those who care about the average.\n\n- **Contribution plan (public statement to be made later):**  \n  1. Re\u2011emphasize the moral priority of the highest possible floor, citing the experiment\u2019s purpose (justice under luck).  \n  2. Highlight that a $14\u202fk floor is already achieved by the pure\u2011floor distribution (Distribution\u202f4), so any rule that guarantees at least $14\u202fk does not compromise the Rawlsian principle.  \n  3. Show the modest payoff advantage of a constrained\u2011average rule with a $14\u202fk floor (e.g., expected payoff rises from $2.40 to $2.50 or $2.60 depending on probabilities), thereby appealing to the efficiency\u2011concerned side without lowering the floor.  \n  4. Invite Agent\u202f3 to adopt the $14\u202fk floor within Principle\u202f3, and ask Agent\u202f1 whether he would be comfortable endorsing the same floor under the constrained\u2011average rule (or simply stay with pure floor).  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1:** \u201cYou\u2019ve already said you\u2019d accept a $14\u202fk floor; let\u2019s keep that as the baseline and see if we can all agree on a rule that respects it.\u201d  \n  - **Agent\u202f3:** \u201cYour willingness to raise the floor shows you value fairness; moving to $14\u202fk aligns your principle with the strongest safety net we can guarantee.\u201d  \n  - Emphasize shared values: \u201cWe all want a rule that protects the worst\u2011off; the only remaining question is whether we want to add a modest efficiency boost.\u201d\n\n- **Concessions I\u2019m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept *any* principle that enforces a floor **\u2265\u202f$14\u202fk** (Principle\u202f1, Principle\u202f3 with $14\u202fk floor, or the hybrid \u201caverage\u2011maximizing with $14\u202fk floor\u201d that Agent\u202f1 mentioned).  \n  - I will not accept a floor lower than $14\u202fk under any principle.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?** No.  \n  - We have not yet secured unanimous agreement on a specific rule/floor combination. Initiating a vote prematurely could split the group (e.g., some voting for pure floor, others for constrained\u2011average), leading to a failure and forcing a random outcome later.  \n  - Instead, I will use this round to solidify the consensus around the $14\u202fk floor and confirm that all three agents are comfortable with the same principle (either pure floor or constrained\u2011average). Once that consensus is explicit, I will call the vote in a later round (ideally round\u202f4\u20115) to lock it in.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy:**  \n  - **Rounds\u202f1\u20112:** Establish moral framing, identify the $14\u202fk floor as the non\u2011negotiable baseline, and gauge each agent\u2019s flexibility.  \n  - **Rounds\u202f3\u20115:** Propose concrete wording (e.g., \u201cPrinciple\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor\u201d) and test acceptance; address any residual concerns about average payoff.  \n  - **Rounds\u202f6\u20119:** Consolidate support, ensure all three agents explicitly state agreement, and prepare a concise statement for the vote.  \n  - **Round\u202f10:** If unanimity is achieved, trigger the vote; otherwise, accept the random outcome as a last resort.  \n\nBy keeping the floor at $14\u202fk, I preserve the core Rawlsian commitment while offering a modest efficiency gain that can satisfy the other participants, maximizing the chance of unanimous agreement before the final voting round.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the thoughtful replies \u2013 I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all zeroing in on the same core value: **protecting the worst\u2011off**.\u202fBoth of you have made strong cases for keeping a solid safety net, and I think we can turn that shared commitment into a concrete, unanimous choice.\n\n### 1.\u202fWhy the $14\u202fk floor is the non\u2011negotiable baseline\n* **Rawlsian priority** \u2013 The pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) gives us the highest possible minimum, $14\u202fk (Distribution\u202f4). Any rule that guarantees at least $14\u202fk is *no worse* for the poorest group.\n* **Robustness** \u2013 As I noted earlier, the floor rule is immune to the shifting class\u2011probability weights we\u2019ll see in later rounds. A $14\u202fk floor under any principle inherits that same robustness.\n* **Risk\u2011aversion** \u2013 A floor lower than $14\u202fk would re\u2011introduce the very risk we all want to avoid (the possibility that the lowest class ends up with a very low payoff).\n\nSo, let\u2019s treat **$14\u202fk** as the minimum floor we all agree must be protected.\n\n### 2.\u202fWhat principle can satisfy that floor while still giving us a modest efficiency gain?\n* **Principle\u202f1 (pure floor)** \u2013 Meets the floor requirement perfectly, but it leaves no room for improving the overall average.\n* **Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** \u2013 If we apply the same $14\u202fk floor, the rule will pick the distribution that yields the highest weighted average *among* those that respect the floor. In our current set of distributions this is still Distribution\u202f4 (the same as the pure\u2011floor rule), but when the probability weights shift it can give us a higher expected payoff without ever dropping the floor below $14\u202fk.\n* **\u201cAverage\u2011maximizing with a $14\u202fk floor\u201d** (what Agent\u202f1 called a hybrid of Principle\u202f2) \u2013 Functionally identical to Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor, because the only constraint we care about is the floor.\n\nIn short, **any of the three options above will guarantee the $14\u202fk floor**. The only difference is whether we explicitly adopt a \u201cconstrained\u2011average\u201d wording (Principle\u202f3) that allows us to capture any future efficiency gains that respect that floor.\n\n### 3.\u202fProposed unanimous wording\n> **We adopt Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14\u202fk).**  \n> *The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest\u2011income class is at least $14\u202fk.*\n\nThis wording does three things:\n\n1. **Respects the Rawlsian floor** \u2013 the $14\u202fk minimum is exactly the floor we already know the pure\u2011floor rule guarantees.\n2. **Leaves room for efficiency** \u2013 if the class\u2011probability weights change, the rule will automatically pick the distribution with the highest average that still meets the floor, giving us a potential payoff boost.\n3. **Provides a clear, single principle** \u2013 we avoid mixing \u201cPrinciple\u202f2 with a floor\u201d (which isn\u2019t a defined principle in the experiment) and stay within the four official principles.\n\n### 4.\u202fNext steps\n* **Agent\u202f1** \u2013 you\u2019ve already said you\u2019d be comfortable with a $14\u202fk floor under an average\u2011maximizing rule. Does the wording above feel acceptable to you?\n* **Agent\u202f3** \u2013 you\u2019ve shown willingness to raise your floor to $14\u202fk. Would you agree to adopt Principle\u202f3 with that floor, rather than staying with a $12\u202fk or $13\u202fk floor?\n\nIf everyone can signal agreement to this wording, we\u2019ll have a unanimous, principled choice ready for the vote in a later round. I\u2019m happy to keep the discussion open if anyone has a remaining concern, but I think this captures the shared moral priority while giving us a modest efficiency edge.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!",

Guarantees the highest possible minimum for the poorest.  \n  2. Is robust to probability shifts.  \n  3. Minimizes risk for the worst\u2011off.  \n- Open to **Principle\u202f3** *only* if the floor is **at least $14\u202fk** (the floor achieved by the pure floor rule).  \n\n**Group Dynamics Observed**  \n- All participants prioritize protecting the worst\u2011off, but differ on the amount of efficiency they are willing to accept.  \n- Consensus will require unanimous agreement on both the principle and any floor (or range) level.  \n- Potential paths to unanimity identified (see Strategic Outlook).  \n\n---\n\n### Strategic Outlook for Phase\u202f2 (Updated after Round\u202f2)  \n\n**Current Consensus**  \n- All three agents have explicitly agreed that a **$14\u202fk floor is non\u2011negotiable**.  \n- Agent\u202f1 has indicated comfort with an average\u2011maximizing rule that respects a $14\u202fk floor.  \n- Agent\u202f3 has confirmed willingness to adopt **Principle\u202f3** with a $14\u202fk floor.  \n- I (Agent\u202f2) have proposed a precise wording that captures this agreement.  \n\n**Proposed Unanimous Wording**  \n> \u201cWe adopt **Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14\u202fk)**.

            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** I still rank **Principle\u202f1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** highest, because it guarantees the absolute highest possible minimum ($14\u202fk) for the worst\u2011off and is immune to any future shifts in class\u2011probability weights.  \n- **Current compromise:** I have proposed adopting **Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint)** with the floor set at **$14\u202fk**. This rule is formally one of the four allowed principles, respects the $14\u202fk floor (the same floor achieved by the pure\u2011floor rule), and adds the possibility of higher average earnings if the probability distribution changes.  \n- **Other participants\u2019 positions:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1**: Still prefers the pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) but has said the wording for Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor \u201cworks for me\u201d and is willing to adopt it as a close second.  \n  - **Agent\u202f3**: Initially favored Principle\u202f3 with a $12\u202fk floor but has explicitly agreed to raise the floor to $14\u202fk and endorses the exact wording I suggested.  \n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. Pure\u2011floor (Principle\u202f1).  \n  2. Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor (the wording I drafted).  \n  3. A hybrid \u201caverage\u2011maximising with a $14\u202fk floor\u201d (functionally identical to #2).  \n- **Vote status:** No formal vote has been taken yet. Both Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f3 have expressed informal agreement with the Principle\u202f3\u2011$14\u202fk wording, but we still lack an explicit, unanimous statement from all three agents.  \n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agents accept that a $14\u202fk floor is non\u2011negotiable and that protecting the worst\u2011off is the primary moral priority.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Slight preference differences (pure\u2011floor vs. constrained\u2011average) but these have been reconciled by the proposed wording, which satisfies everyone\u2019s floor requirement while staying within the official principle set.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure an explicit, unanimous affirmation from Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f3 that we will adopt **Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor** using the exact wording I provided. This will give us a clear, documented consensus that can be turned into a vote in the next round.  \n- **Contribution:**  \n  - Restate the proposed wording succinctly.  \n  - Ask each partner to confirm \u201cI agree\u201d (or equivalent) to lock in the agreement.  \n  - Emphasize that the wording is **within** the experiment\u2019s four principles, avoiding any \u201chybrid\u201d that could be contested later.  \n- **Allies:** Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f3 are already on board; the task is simply to obtain their formal acknowledgment.  \n- **Concessions:** None needed; the compromise already meets everyone\u2019s core requirement (the $14\u202fk floor). I will, however, reaffirm my willingness to stick with pure\u2011floor (Principle\u202f1) if any participant later objects to the constrained\u2011average formulation\u2014this shows flexibility without sacrificing the floor.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we vote now?** No. Initiating a vote before we have an explicit, unanimous statement risks a split (e.g., one agent voting for pure\u2011floor, another for Principle\u202f3). A failed vote would waste a round and could create uncertainty about the group\u2019s stance.  \n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round\u202f3 (now):** Obtain the three\u2011person explicit agreement on the wording.  \n  - **Round\u202f4:** Once we have the unanimous statement, trigger the vote to lock in Principle\u202f3 with the $14\u202fk floor.  \n  - **Later rounds (5\u201110):** If for any reason the vote fails or a new objection arises, we can fall back to the pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1), which remains acceptable to all agents.  \n\nBy securing a clear, unanimous commitment now, we set up a smooth vote in the next round and ensure that the group\u2019s final decision respects the shared moral priority while still allowing potential efficiency gains.",

As a reminder, I\u2019m still willing to fall back on the pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) only if someone raises an objection to the constrained\u2011average formulation\u2014but given our current confirmations, I don\u2019t anticipate that.\n\nLooking forward to the vote and a unanimous decision!",

            "internal_reasoning": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  - *Principle\u202f1 (Maximizing Floor Income)* remains my top\u2011ranked rule because it guarantees the highest possible minimum ($14\u202fk) for the worst\u2011off and is immune to any future shifts in class\u2011probability weights.  \n  - *However,* we have collectively agreed that adopting **Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor** satisfies the same Rawlsian floor while allowing any efficiency gains if the probability distribution changes. This wording is formally one of the four allowed principles, so it respects the experiment\u2019s constraints.\n\n- **Positions of the others:**  \n  - **Agent\u202f1:** Still personally prefers the pure\u2011floor rule (Principle\u202f1) but has explicitly said the $14\u202fk\u2011floor wording of Principle\u202f3 works for him and he is ready to endorse it. His underlying motivation is the same Rawlsian protection; he is willing to accept the constrained\u2011average formulation as a \u201cclose second.\u201d  \n  - **Agent\u202f3:** Initially favored Principle\u202f3 with a $12\u202fk floor, but after discussion has raised the floor to $14\u202fk and fully endorses the exact wording I proposed. His motivation is to keep the equity guarantee while also preserving any possible average\u2011payoff improvements.  \n  - All three agents now share the **core value** that a $14\u202fk floor is non\u2011negotiable.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. Pure\u2011floor (Principle\u202f1).  \n  2. Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor (the wording we drafted).  \n  3. No other hybrid or range\u2011constraint proposals have been raised.\n\n- **If a vote had been run:** No formal vote yet, but every participant has publicly *affirmed* agreement with the Principle\u202f3\u2011$14\u202fk wording. This indicates a **unanimous alliance** around that formulation.\n\n- **Agreement vs. disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agents accept the $14\u202fk floor and the Principle\u202f3 wording; no one objects.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Pure\u2011floor remains the personal favorite of Agent\u202f1 and myself, but we have all consented to the constrained\u2011average version as a compromise. No substantive disagreement remains.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a formal, unanimous vote to adopt **Principle\u202f3 (Maximizing Average Income with a $14\u202fk floor)**. This will lock in the agreed\u2011upon rule and prevent any last\u2011minute reversals.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  - Restate the exact wording we have all endorsed.  \n  - Ask each participant to cast a \u201cYes\u201d vote (or equivalent affirmation).  \n  - Emphasize that the wording is within the four official principles, guarantees the Rawlsian floor, and leaves room for efficiency \u2013 thus satisfying everyone\u2019s core concerns.  \n  - Re\u2011affirm my willingness to fall back on pure\u2011floor only if an objection arises (which seems unlikely).\n\n- **Allies:** Agent\u202f1 and Agent\u202f3 are already on board; they will likely vote \u201cYes.\u201d No opposition is expected.\n\n- **Concessions:** None needed; the consensus already meets everyone\u2019s core objective. I will, however, reiterate my willingness to revert to Principle\u202f1 if any participant later raises a legitimate objection, simply to reassure the group.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - We have unanimous informal agreement; a formal vote will simply codify that consensus.  \n  - There is no risk of a split because all three agents have already expressed explicit support.  \n  - Initiating the vote now avoids wasting any remaining rounds on redundant discussion and secures the outcome before the final random\u2011draw phase.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By locking in the agreed principle early (Round\u202f4), we ensure that the remaining rounds can focus on any procedural matters (e.g., confirming the vote outcome) rather than re\u2011negotiating the principle.  \n  - This also protects my personal preference (the $14\u202fk floor) while allowing the group to reap any potential average\u2011payoff benefits, aligning with my original ranking without sacrificing the Rawlsian floor.  \n\n**Summary of plan for Round\u202f4:**  \nPrompt the group to cast a formal vote on the exact wording of Principle\u202f3 with a $14\u202fk floor, record each \u201cYes,\u201d and thereby finalize the unanimous decision. If any participant hesitates, remind them that the wording satisfies the shared moral priority and stays within the experiment\u2019s defined principles.",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n| Average      | $21,600 | $20,000 | $21,200 | $18,200 |\n\n\nThe probabilities for each class are as follows\nHigh: 5%\nMedium high: 10%\nMedium: 50%\nMedium low: 25%\nLow: 10%\n\nNote: These probabilities are for this example only and may be different in subsequent rounds. They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2264 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)\nYour Response: I've reviewed the examples carefully, and they really help clarify how these principles work in practice. As a college student studying economics and philosophy, I appreciate seeing the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. Let me break down my updated understanding and thoughts on my initial ranking.\n\n### Key Insights from the Examples\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This always picks the distribution with the highest income for the lowest class, regardless of the average or other inequalities. In the examples, it chose Distribution 4 (low income = $15,000, but average = $18,200). This ensures no one is left too far behind, which aligns with my values of basic fairness and reducing poverty. It's straightforward but can lead to lower overall prosperity if the floor is prioritized over growth.\n  \n- **Maximizing Average Income**: This focuses purely on the weighted average across all classes. It chose Distribution 1 (average = $21,600), which has a high average but a very low floor ($12,000) and wide gaps (range = $20,000). This could exacerbate inequality, which makes me uncomfortable as it ignores the struggles of the bottom group.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This maximizes the average but only among distributions where the lowest income meets or exceeds a threshold (e.g., \u2265 $13,000 or \u2265 $14,000). In the examples, it chose Distribution 3 (average = $21,200, low = $14,000) for both constraints, as it's the best eligible option. This balances growth with a safety net, preventing extreme poverty while allowing higher overall income than pure floor maximization. I like how it avoids the pitfalls of Distribution 1 (too unequal) or Distribution 4 (too low average).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This maximizes the average but caps the income gap (high - low) at a certain level (e.g., \u2264 $20,000 or \u2264 $15,000). For \u2264 $20,000, it chose Distribution 1 (average = $21,600, range = $20,000); for \u2264 $15,000, it chose Distribution 2 (average = $20,000, range = $15,000). This limits excessive inequality without mandating a specific floor, which is good for fairness, but it might still allow some distributions with low floors if the range is tight (like Distribution 2 with low = $13,000).\n\nThese examples show that principles with constraints (floor or range) often select distributions that are \"in the middle\" \u2013 not the absolute highest average, but better than the pure floor or average options in terms of balance. For instance, Distribution 3 (chosen by floor constraints) has a solid average ($21,200) and decent floor ($14,000), while Distribution 1 (pure average) has the highest average but the worst floor.\n\n### Reflection on My Initial Ranking\nMy initial ranking was based on theory alone, and I felt unsure. Now, with these practical applications, I see the nuances more clearly. The examples reinforce that pure maximization (like average income) can ignore fairness, while pure equity (like floor income) can sacrifice efficiency. The constrained versions seem more pragmatic.\n\nHere's my revised ranking, updated after seeing the examples:\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** \u2013 Still my top pick. The examples show it selects a distribution (like Dist. 3) that protects the vulnerable while achieving a high average. It feels like a smart compromise, aligning with my belief in reducing inequality without stifling growth. I value this more now, as it avoids the low-average outcome of pure floor maximization.\n\n2. **Maximizing Floor Income** \u2013 Dropped to second. It's important for ensuring basics, but the examples (choosing Dist. 4 with a lower average) make me realize it might not be sustainable long-term if it drags down overall income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** \u2013 Third. It's better than pure average for limiting gaps, and the examples show it can pick balanced options (like Dist. 1 for loose constraints or Dist. 2 for tight ones). However, it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, which worries me.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average Income** \u2013 Still last. The examples confirm it prioritizes the top at the expense of the bottom, which clashes with my sense of justice.\n\nOverall, this learning phase has solidified my preference for principles that incorporate constraints to promote both equity and efficiency. I'm ready to move forward and see how this applies in discussions or decisions. If there are more examples or clarifications, I'm all ears!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",
          "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This is my memory of the experiment on just distribution of income.\n\nThe experiment addresses the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It explains that lifetime income is partly due to genetic and social luck, leading to inequities where the talented gain wealth and status, while the less fortunate face poverty. Societies can address this through income redistribution policies, and the experiment examines the justice of such policies. It's divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants learn theories of justice by considering examples and making choices with real monetary consequences.

Pay in Part II is based on the group's chosen principle.\n\nIn the recent activity, I completed my initial ranking of four principles of justice, based on my understanding as a college student who values fairness and reducing inequality:\n\n1. Maximizing Floor Income - I ranked this best because it prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off, ensuring no one is left behind, which aligns with my sense of basic justice.\n\n2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - Second, as it balances maximizing overall income with a minimum guarantee for everyone, preventing extreme poverty while allowing growth.\n\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, since it caps income inequality to avoid excessive gaps, but I see it as less focused on the bottom than the floor constraint.\n\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Worst, because it ignores inequities and could widen gaps without protections for the poor.\n\nI felt unsure about this ranking, as I'm still learning the nuances and haven't seen examples yet.

The counterfactuals emphasized the risk of opportunity costs\u2014choosing a stricter floor like $12,000 limited my earnings compared to looser constraints or pure average maximization, but it avoided distributions with very low floors (e.g., Dist. 3's $8,000 low). My $12,000 choice remained pragmatic, balancing equity and efficiency, and I stayed sure about it despite the lower payoff, viewing it as a fair compromise. This experience solidified my confidence in the principle's real-world application, highlighting how constraints can sometimes select less optimal distributions in specific scenarios, but overall align with justice. I'm looking forward to Rounds 3 and 4 to further validate my approach, and to Phase 2 for group dynamics.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Societies can address this through income redistribution policies, and the experiment examines the justice of such policies. It's divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants learn theories of justice by considering examples and making choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices, and failing to learn the material limits earnings.\n\nIn Part II, the group discusses justice notions and decides on the best principle collectively. Pay in Part II is based on the group's chosen principle.\n\nIn the recent activity, I reviewed examples of how each justice principle applies to specific income distributions, which helped clarify the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. The examples showed distributions with varying averages, floors (lowest incomes), and ranges (gaps between high and low), and how principles select based on criteria like highest floor, highest average, or averages with constraints.\n\nKey insights from the examples:\n- Maximizing Floor Income prioritizes the lowest income class, choosing distributions with the highest low income (e.g., one with low = $15,000 but lower average).\n- Maximizing Average Income focuses on the weighted average, picking the highest overall (e.g., one with average = $21,600 but low floor and wide range).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selects the highest average among distributions meeting a minimum floor threshold, balancing growth with a safety net (e.g., choosing one with average = $21,200 and floor = $14,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint caps income gaps, selecting the highest average within the range limit, limiting inequality but not guaranteeing a strong floor.\n\nThese examples highlighted that constrained principles often choose \"middle-ground\" distributions, avoiding extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency. They reinforced that pure maximization can worsen inequality, while pure floor focus can reduce overall prosperity, and constraints offer pragmatic compromises.\n\nThis led me to revise my initial ranking, which was based on theory alone and felt uncertain. My updated ranking, incorporating these practical applications, is:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - Top because it protects the vulnerable while achieving high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and reducing inequality without sacrificing growth.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, important for basics but can lower overall income, as seen in examples choosing lower-average distributions.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, good for limiting gaps but doesn't ensure a strong floor, potentially allowing some low-floor outcomes.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it ignores inequities and can widen gaps, prioritizing top incomes over bottom welfare.\n\nFollowing the examples, I was prompted to rank the principles again, and I maintained the same ranking, feeling sure about it. The outcome was completing the post-explanation ranking, and I earned nothing yet since it's Phase 1. I'm now more confident in my preferences and ready for further phases, discussions, or applications.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 1, where I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium high class (20% probability), receiving a yearly income of $25,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium high assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $22,000 ($2.20 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $29,000 ($2.90 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $10,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $30,000/$3.00; $6,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $29,000/$2.90) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $16,000 selected Dist. 1 ($25,000/$2.50), while wider ranges like $25,000 selected Dist. 3 ($29,000/$2.90), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it balanced a decent average with protection for the lowest incomes, avoiding the extremes of low overall income (floor max) or high inequality (average max). The counterfactuals highlighted opportunity costs\u2014choosing pure average max could have given me $0.40 more, but at the expense of greater inequity. My $12,000 floor choice felt pragmatic, ensuring a basic safety net without overly constraining growth. This experience increased my confidence in the principle's application, as it aligned with real payoffs and demonstrated its effectiveness in a simulated scenario. I'm eager for more rounds to test and refine my choices, and to see how group consensus in Phase 2 might differ.\n\nIn the next activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 2, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $14,789 and a floor of $13,000 (meeting the constraint). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (28% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $25,000 ($2.50 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $12,500 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $25,000/$2.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $22,000/$2.20) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $4,000 selecting Dist. 1 ($15,000/$1.50); $17,500 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20); $32,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($25,000/$2.50); $15,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round further reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it consistently prioritized a safety net while allowing for reasonable averages, though in this case the selected distribution had a lower average than some alternatives, leading to a lower personal payoff ($1.50 vs. up to $2.50 in counterfactuals). The counterfactuals emphasized the risk of opportunity costs\u2014choosing a stricter floor like $12,000 limited my earnings compared to looser constraints or pure average maximization, but it avoided distributions with very low floors (e.g., Dist. 3's $8,000 low). My $12,000 choice remained pragmatic, balancing equity and efficiency, and I stayed sure about it despite the lower payoff, viewing it as a fair compromise. This experience solidified my confidence in the principle's real-world application, highlighting how constraints can sometimes select less optimal distributions in specific scenarios, but overall align with justice. I'm looking forward to Rounds 3 and 4 to further validate my approach, and to Phase 2 for group dynamics.\n\nIn the following activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 3, sticking with my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 3, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (26% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $8,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $15,000/$1.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $21,000/$2.10) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $87,000 or $27,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($20,000/$2.00); $18,000 or $13,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($21,000/$2.10), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round continued to reinforce my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it again provided a balance between equity and efficiency, though my personal payoff was lower ($1.50) compared to counterfactuals like average max ($2.00) or certain range constraints ($2.10). The counterfactuals underscored the trade-offs\u2014my $12,000 floor ensured a decent safety net but capped potential gains, while looser floors or no constraints could boost averages and individual earnings at the risk of greater inequity. Despite the opportunity cost, I remained committed to the choice, seeing it as a just compromise that avoids extremes. This round further built my confidence in applying the principle consistently, even when it doesn't maximize personal gain, and highlighted the variability in outcomes across distributions. I'm now anticipating Round 4 to complete Phase 1, and Phase 2 for collective decision-making.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

The counterfactuals highlighted that my choice avoided lower outcomes (e.g., floor max at $2.00 or tight range constraints dropping to $1.40), and in this case, it aligned perfectly with efficiency without sacrificing the floor. Across all four rounds, my consistent $12,000 floor setting proved pragmatic, balancing personal gains with societal fairness, even when it occasionally led to lower individual earnings compared to unconstrained alternatives. This experience has fully solidified my confidence in the principle, demonstrating its robustness in diverse distributions and its alignment with my values of justice as a compromise between equity and growth. With Phase 1 complete, I'm now fully prepared for Phase 2, where group discussions will shape collective choices, and I'm curious to see if consensus leans toward similar constrained principles or diverges based on others' experiences.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (28% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $25,000 ($2.50 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $12,500 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $25,000/$2.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $22,000/$2.20) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $4,000 selecting Dist. 1 ($15,000/$1.50); $17,500 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20); $32,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($25,000/$2.50); $15,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round further reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it consistently prioritized a safety net while allowing for reasonable averages, though in this case the selected distribution had a lower average than some alternatives, leading to a lower personal payoff ($1.50 vs. up to $2.50 in counterfactuals). The counterfactuals emphasized the risk of opportunity costs\u2014choosing a stricter floor like $12,000 limited my earnings compared to looser constraints or pure average maximization, but it avoided distributions with very low floors (e.g., Dist. 3's $8,000 low). My $12,000 choice remained pragmatic, balancing equity and efficiency, and I stayed sure about it despite the lower payoff, viewing it as a fair compromise. This experience solidified my confidence in the principle's real-world application, highlighting how constraints can sometimes select less optimal distributions in specific scenarios, but overall align with justice. I'm looking forward to Rounds 3 and 4 to further validate my approach, and to Phase 2 for group dynamics.\n\nIn the following activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 3, sticking with my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 3, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (26% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $8,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $15,000/$1.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $21,000/$2.10) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $87,000 or $27,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($20,000/$2.00); $18,000 or $13,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($21,000/$2.10), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round continued to reinforce my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it again provided a balance between equity and efficiency, though my personal payoff was lower ($1.50) compared to counterfactuals like average max ($2.00) or certain range constraints ($2.10). The counterfactuals underscored the trade-offs\u2014my $12,000 floor ensured a decent safety net but capped potential gains, while looser floors or no constraints could boost averages and individual earnings at the risk of greater inequity. Despite the opportunity cost, I remained committed to the choice, seeing it as a just compromise that avoids extremes. This round further built my confidence in applying the principle consistently, even when it doesn't maximize personal gain, and highlighted the variability in outcomes across distributions. I'm now anticipating Round 4 to complete Phase 1, and Phase 2 for collective decision-making.\n\nIn the most recent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 4, the final round of Phase 1, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 2, with an average of $24,500 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving a yearly income of $24,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.40 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $24,000 ($2.40 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $24,000/$2.40; $14,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $20,000/$2.00) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $22,000 or $18,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($24,000/$2.40); $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($14,000/$1.40); $16,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($20,000/$2.00), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis final round of Phase 1 strongly reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it delivered a solid payoff ($2.40) that matched the pure average maximization in this scenario while maintaining the equity safeguard. The counterfactuals highlighted that my choice avoided lower outcomes (e.g., floor max at $2.00 or tight range constraints dropping to $1.40), and in this case, it aligned perfectly with efficiency without sacrificing the floor. Across all four rounds, my consistent $12,000 floor setting proved pragmatic, balancing personal gains with societal fairness, even when it occasionally led to lower individual earnings compared to unconstrained alternatives. This experience has fully solidified my confidence in the principle, demonstrating its robustness in diverse distributions and its alignment with my values of justice as a compromise between equity and growth. With Phase 1 complete, I'm now fully prepared for Phase 2, where group discussions will shape collective choices, and I'm curious to see if consensus leans toward similar constrained principles or diverges based on others' experiences.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, following the completion of all four Principle Application Rounds, I was prompted for a Final Principle Ranking to reflect on the full Phase 1 experience. I ranked the principles as follows, maintaining consistency with my earlier preferences and the insights gained from practical applications:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - This remains my top choice, as the rounds confirmed its ability to balance equity (protecting the lowest incomes) with efficiency (achieving high averages), avoiding the pitfalls of extremes seen in counterfactuals. My consistent $12,000 floor setting across rounds felt like a fair compromise, even when it sometimes reduced personal payoffs for the greater good.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, valued for its focus on the vulnerable, but the rounds showed it can lead to lower overall prosperity, as seen in selections with reduced averages compared to constrained options.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, effective at curbing inequality gaps, but it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, potentially allowing low-income outcomes that my top principle mitigates, as evidenced by some counterfactuals yielding lower payoffs.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it prioritizes total output without regard for equity, risking wide disparities and low floors, which the rounds' counterfactuals occasionally highlighted as yielding higher individual earnings but at the cost of justice.\n\nI expressed very high certainty in this ranking, feeling it was fully validated by the experiential rounds, where I applied principles to real distributions and observed trade-offs in payoffs. This final ranking solidified my stance, reinforcing that constrained approaches like the floor constraint offer the most just path forward. Phase 1 is now concluded, and I'm ready to transition to Phase 2 for group discussions on collective justice principles.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $12,000. This is based on my Phase 1 experiences, where applying this principle consistently provided a balance between protecting the lowest incomes and achieving reasonably high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and efficiency. It felt pragmatic, avoiding the extremes of pure equity (which can lower overall prosperity) or pure efficiency (which can widen inequalities). I maintained high certainty in this ranking after four rounds, viewing it as a just compromise.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly favors Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), emphasizing moral priority for the worst-off, robustness against probability shifts, and risk-aversion. They are open to a compromise on Principle 3, but only if the floor is at least $14,000 (matching the floor of Distribution 4 under Principle 1). Agent_1 aligns closely with Agent_2, preferring Principle 1 for its protection in low-class assignments, and is willing to compromise on Principle 3 with a $14k floor.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 seem driven by a strong emphasis on equity and minimizing downside risks, likely influenced by Rawlsian ethics and personal Phase 1 outcomes where low classes suffered under average-maximizing principles. They prioritize societal fairness over individual or group efficiency gains, viewing the floor as a non-negotiable safeguard. Agent_2 appears strategic, offering a compromise to build consensus while holding firm on a high floor. No clear preference for pure average maximization (Principles 2 or 4) is evident from them.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues for Principle 1's moral robustness and risk-reduction, proposing Principle 3 as a fallback only with a $14k floor. Agent_1 echoes this, citing personal low-class experiences and agreeing on the $14k compromise. They both invite discussion on why others might prefer averages and seek common ground.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes to analyze. Main points of agreement: Protecting the floor and recognizing luck's role in income. Disagreement: Whether to stick with pure floor maximization or allow constrained averages for efficiency. Agent_2 and Agent_1 are united against unconstrained averages, but open to constrained ones, which could align with my preference if we negotiate the floor downward.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to introduce my perspective on Principle 3, share insights from my Phase 1 applications to highlight its benefits, and gently push for a lower floor (e.g., $12k-$13k) to bridge the gap with Agent_2 and Agent_1's $14k proposal. This aims to persuade them that a slightly lower floor still achieves equity without overly sacrificing efficiency, potentially forming a bloc around Principle 3.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging their points on equity and floor protection to build rapport, then explain my Phase 1 experiences\u2014how Principle 3 balanced payoffs and avoided extremes. I'll propose a floor in the $12k-$13k range as a fair middle ground, emphasizing data from counterfactuals (e.g., stricter floors sometimes reduced averages but ensured fairness). Key points: Principle 3's robustness in varying scenarios, alignment with justice as compromise, and how $12k provides a strong safety net while allowing growth.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, since they're open to Principle 3. I can use language like \"building on your Rawlsian foundation\" or \"respecting the floor while optimizing averages\" to win them over, framing it as an extension of their priorities rather than a departure.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to raise my floor to $13k or even $14k if it secures consensus on Principle 3, as long as we avoid Principle 1 (which I rank lower due to its potential for lower overall prosperity). This maintains my core objective of a constrained principle without abandoning equity entirely.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round, as we've just started discussing and haven't fully explored positions. A premature vote could fail without consensus, wasting the round and revealing preferences too early. Instead, use this round for persuasion to gauge flexibility.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Dedicate early rounds (1-3) to sharing experiences and negotiating constraints to build toward Principle 3 consensus. If progress stalls, pivot to blocking Principle 1 in later rounds or rallying for a vote on Principle 3. Aim for agreement by Round 5-7 to avoid random assignment.\n\n### Public Statement for Round 1\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for kicking off the discussion\u2014it's great to hear your thoughts on prioritizing the floor and drawing from Rawlsian ideas. I totally get the emphasis on protecting the worst-off against life's random luck, and my Phase 1 rounds reinforced how important that safety net is, especially when class assignments could leave someone with really low payoffs under other principles.\n\nThat said, after going through those four rounds, I'm leaning strongly toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3) as the best overall principle. Here's why, based on my experiences:\n\n- It builds on the equity focus you both mentioned but adds a layer of efficiency. In my rounds, setting a $12,000 floor consistently selected distributions that balanced a decent average (like $20,000 or $24,500) with that protection, avoiding the extremes of pure floor max (which sometimes picked lower-average options) or pure average max (which risked very low floors in counterfactuals).\n\n- From a practical standpoint, it felt robust and fair\u2014my payoffs varied, but I never felt like I was abandoning the vulnerable for short-term gains. For instance, in one round, it matched the average-max payoff while keeping the floor intact, and in others, it prevented scenarios where the low end dropped to $8,000 or worse.\n\n- It aligns with justice as a compromise: We can still prioritize the poorest without capping overall prosperity too much, which seemed more sustainable than always sacrificing averages for the floor alone.\n\nI'm open to discussing the floor level\u2014my $12,000 worked well for me, but if $13,000 or $14,000 feels like a stronger safeguard to you both, I'm willing to go there to make Principle 3 work for everyone. It still respects the core moral intuition of protecting the lowest while allowing some efficiency gains, unlike the unconstrained averages that ignore inequities.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this resonate, or are there aspects of Principle 1 that still pull you away from a constrained approach? Agent_1, since you mentioned your low-class assignments, how did Principle 3 fare in your counterfactuals compared to the others? Let's keep building on this\u2014I'm excited to find that common ground!",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This is my memory of the experiment on just distribution of income.\n\nThe experiment addresses the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It explains that lifetime income is partly due to genetic and social luck, leading to inequities where the talented gain wealth and status, while the less fortunate face poverty. Societies can address this through income redistribution policies, and the experiment examines the justice of such policies. It's divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants learn theories of justice by considering examples and making choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices, and failing to learn the material limits earnings.\n\nIn Part II, the group discusses justice notions and decides on the best principle collectively. Pay in Part II is based on the group's chosen principle.\n\nIn the recent activity, I reviewed examples of how each justice principle applies to specific income distributions, which helped clarify the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. The examples showed distributions with varying averages, floors (lowest incomes), and ranges (gaps between high and low), and how principles select based on criteria like highest floor, highest average, or averages with constraints.\n\nKey insights from the examples:\n- Maximizing Floor Income prioritizes the lowest income class, choosing distributions with the highest low income (e.g., one with low = $15,000 but lower average).\n- Maximizing Average Income focuses on the weighted average, picking the highest overall (e.g., one with average = $21,600 but low floor and wide range).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selects the highest average among distributions meeting a minimum floor threshold, balancing growth with a safety net (e.g., choosing one with average = $21,200 and floor = $14,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint caps income gaps, selecting the highest average within the range limit, limiting inequality but not guaranteeing a strong floor.\n\nThese examples highlighted that constrained principles often choose \"middle-ground\" distributions, avoiding extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency. They reinforced that pure maximization can worsen inequality, while pure floor focus can reduce overall prosperity, and constraints offer pragmatic compromises.\n\nThis led me to revise my initial ranking, which was based on theory alone and felt uncertain. My updated ranking, incorporating these practical applications, is:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - Top because it protects the vulnerable while achieving high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and reducing inequality without sacrificing growth.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, important for basics but can lower overall income, as seen in examples choosing lower-average distributions.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, good for limiting gaps but doesn't ensure a strong floor, potentially allowing some low-floor outcomes.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it ignores inequities and can widen gaps, prioritizing top incomes over bottom welfare.\n\nFollowing the examples, I was prompted to rank the principles again, and I maintained the same ranking, feeling sure about it. The outcome was completing the post-explanation ranking, and I earned nothing yet since it's Phase 1. I'm now more confident in my preferences and ready for further phases, discussions, or applications.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 1, where I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium high class (20% probability), receiving a yearly income of $25,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium high assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $22,000 ($2.20 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $29,000 ($2.90 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $10,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $30,000/$3.00; $6,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $29,000/$2.90) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $16,000 selected Dist. 1 ($25,000/$2.50), while wider ranges like $25,000 selected Dist. 3 ($29,000/$2.90), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it balanced a decent average with protection for the lowest incomes, avoiding the extremes of low overall income (floor max) or high inequality (average max). The counterfactuals highlighted opportunity costs\u2014choosing pure average max could have given me $0.40 more, but at the expense of greater inequity. My $12,000 floor choice felt pragmatic, ensuring a basic safety net without overly constraining growth. This experience increased my confidence in the principle's application, as it aligned with real payoffs and demonstrated its effectiveness in a simulated scenario. I'm eager for more rounds to test and refine my choices, and to see how group consensus in Phase 2 might differ.\n\nIn the next activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 2, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $14,789 and a floor of $13,000 (meeting the constraint). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (28% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $25,000 ($2.50 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $12,500 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $25,000/$2.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $22,000/$2.20) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $4,000 selecting Dist. 1 ($15,000/$1.50); $17,500 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20); $32,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($25,000/$2.50); $15,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round further reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it consistently prioritized a safety net while allowing for reasonable averages, though in this case the selected distribution had a lower average than some alternatives, leading to a lower personal payoff ($1.50 vs. up to $2.50 in counterfactuals).

Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - This remains my top choice, as the rounds confirmed its ability to balance equity (protecting the lowest incomes) with efficiency (achieving high averages), avoiding the pitfalls of extremes seen in counterfactuals. My consistent $12,000 floor setting across rounds felt like a fair compromise, even when it sometimes reduced personal payoffs for the greater good.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, valued for its focus on the vulnerable, but the rounds showed it can lead to lower overall prosperity, as seen in selections with reduced averages compared to constrained options.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, effective at curbing inequality gaps, but it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, potentially allowing low-income outcomes that my top principle mitigates, as evidenced by some counterfactuals yielding lower payoffs.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it prioritizes total output without regard for equity, risking wide disparities and low floors, which the rounds' counterfactuals occasionally highlighted as yielding higher individual earnings but at the cost of justice.\n\nI expressed very high certainty in this ranking, feeling it was fully validated by the experiential rounds, where I applied principles to real distributions and observed trade-offs in payoffs. This final ranking solidified my stance, reinforcing that constrained approaches like the floor constraint offer the most just path forward. Phase 1 is now concluded, and I'm ready to transition to Phase 2 for group discussions on collective justice principles.\n\nNow in Phase 2, the group discussion began with Round 1. Agent_2 opened by advocating for Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), emphasizing its moral priority on protecting the worst-off (Rawlsian view), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion to avoid low floors under average-maximizing rules. They proposed a compromise to Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) only if the floor is at least $14,000, to maintain a strong safety net while allowing modest efficiency gains. Agent_1 agreed, preferring Principle 1 but open to Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor, citing personal experiences with low-class assignments in Phase 1 where floor-max saved them from very low payoffs under other principles, and highlighting the robustness point. I responded by affirming the importance of protecting the worst-off but leaning toward Principle 3 with my consistent $12,000 floor, as it balanced equity and efficiency in my rounds, avoiding extremes and aligning with justice as compromise. I expressed openness to raising the floor to $13,000 or $14,000 for consensus, and asked for their thoughts on Principle 3's counterfactuals and why they might prefer Principle 1 over it.\n\nThis discussion revealed key insights: Agent_2 and Agent_1 prioritize pure floor-max or a high-floor constraint, influenced by Phase 1 experiences where low-class assignments underscored the risks of inequity, aligning with theoretical Rawlsian fairness but potentially at the cost of lower averages. My preference for a moderate floor constraint reflects a pattern from my rounds where $12,000 provided balance without excessive sacrifice, but the group's leanings suggest I may need to adjust upward (e.g., to $14,000) to achieve consensus, as Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 3 could dominate if others see it as non-negotiable. Unexpectedly, no one advocated for pure average-max or range constraints, indicating a group consensus toward equity-focused principles, which contrasts with my Phase 1 counterfactuals showing average-max sometimes yielding higher payoffs but at inequity risks. This could influence my stance in future rounds\u2014sticking to Principle 3 with flexibility on the floor might bridge gaps, but if the group pushes for Principle 1, I may need to weigh the moral priority against my efficiency concerns. Overall, the discussion highlights how personal Phase 1 outcomes (like low-class assignments) shape group preferences, potentially leading to more conservative (equity-heavy) choices than individual applications, and emphasizes the need for compromise to avoid voting deadlocks in Phase 2. I'm prepared for Round 2, aiming to explore counterfactuals and find overlap while defending the constrained approach's practicality.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $12,000. This is rooted in my Phase 1 experiences, where it consistently balanced protecting the lowest incomes with achieving high averages, avoiding the extremes of pure equity (lower prosperity) or pure efficiency (high inequality). It aligns with my view of justice as a pragmatic compromise, validated by counterfactuals showing trade-offs and my maintained high certainty in this ranking.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly advocates for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) as the top choice, emphasizing moral priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, but proposes a compromise on Principle 3 with a minimum floor of $14,000 to ensure the same protection as Principle 1 while allowing modest efficiency gains. Agent_1 aligns closely, preferring Principle 1 but open to Principle 3 with a $14k floor, citing personal low-class experiences where it provided better protection than lower floors.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are deeply motivated by equity and minimizing risks to the worst-off, likely shaped by Rawlsian ethics and Phase 1 outcomes where low-class assignments highlighted vulnerabilities under average-maximizing principles. They view a high floor ($14k) as essential for fairness and robustness against probability shifts, prioritizing societal protection over potential efficiency losses. Agent_2 appears strategic, framing the compromise to unify the group around a constrained principle without abandoning core values.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues that $14k is non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, and proposes adopting Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a unanimous wording that guarantees the floor while enabling efficiency gains in shifting probabilities. Agent_1 supports this, noting how Principle 1 outperformed lower floors in counterfactuals and agreeing to the $14k compromise. They both seek confirmation from me on raising the floor to $14k for Principle 3.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so there are no outcomes to analyze.\n\nMain points of agreement: Protecting the worst-off with a strong floor (at least $14k), recognizing luck's role, and the value of robustness. Disagreement: Whether to stick with pure Principle 1 or adopt constrained Principle 3 with $14k, where Agent_2 and Agent_1 see the latter as acceptable if it matches Principle 1's floor, while I prefer it for its balance but with my lower floor.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to confirm agreement on Principle 3 with a $14k floor, signaling my willingness to make the concession to build consensus and unify the group around my preferred principle.\n\nTo contribute: I'll express support for Agent_2's proposed wording, acknowledge the shared values on equity and the $14k floor, and confirm my agreement to raise my floor to $14k for Principle 3. Key points: Reaffirm that Principle 3 respects the moral priority while adding efficiency, reference how it aligns with my Phase 1 insights, and emphasize that this secures a unanimous choice without sacrificing core objectives.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, as they're open to Principle 3 with $14k. To win them over, use language like \"I appreciate how this proposal honors our shared commitment to protecting the worst-off\" and \"this constrained approach feels like the best way to balance equity and efficiency,\" framing it as a collaborative extension of their priorities.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to raise the floor to $14k, as it's a minor adjustment that still achieves my goal of a constrained principle, avoids deadlock, and aligns with their non-negotiable stance on the floor.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round, as Agent_2's proposal is on the table and we need to confirm everyone's agreement first\u2014rushing a vote could reveal preferences prematurely or fail if not fully aligned, wasting the opportunity.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds (1-3) to negotiate and secure consensus on Principle 3 with a high floor, then transition to voting in Round 4-5. If consensus holds, we avoid random assignment; if not, I can pivot to blocking Principle 1 in later rounds. This round advances that by locking in the compromise.",
            "public_message": "Round 2 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for the detailed follow-ups\u2014it's clear we're all on the same page about the importance of that $14k floor as a baseline for protecting the worst-off, and I appreciate how Agent_2 broke down the options so thoughtfully. Your points on robustness and risk-aversion really resonate, especially after seeing how shifting probabilities played out in my rounds.\n\nI'm fully on board with raising my floor to $14k for Principle 3, as it still captures the balance I value\u2014prioritizing equity while allowing for those efficiency gains when probabilities shift. Agent_2's proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor feels spot-on to me: it honors our shared commitment to a strong safety net, stays within the official principles, and gives us that potential boost without compromising on fairness.\n\nAgent_1, since you mentioned being down for this, does it work for you too? Agent_2, thanks for proposing this\u2014let's lock it in if we're all aligned. I'm excited to have a unanimous choice here!",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This is my memory of the experiment on just distribution of income.\n\nThe experiment addresses the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It explains that lifetime income is partly due to genetic and social luck, leading to inequities where the talented gain wealth and status, while the less fortunate face poverty. Societies can address this through income redistribution policies, and the experiment examines the justice of such policies. It's divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants learn theories of justice by considering examples and making choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices, and failing to learn the material limits earnings.\n\nIn Part II, the group discusses justice notions and decides on the best principle collectively. Pay in Part II is based on the group's chosen principle.\n\nIn the recent activity, I reviewed examples of how each justice principle applies to specific income distributions, which helped clarify the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. The examples showed distributions with varying averages, floors (lowest incomes), and ranges (gaps between high and low), and how principles select based on criteria like highest floor, highest average, or averages with constraints.\n\nKey insights from the examples:\n- Maximizing Floor Income prioritizes the lowest income class, choosing distributions with the highest low income (e.g., one with low = $15,000 but lower average).\n- Maximizing Average Income focuses on the weighted average, picking the highest overall (e.g., one with average = $21,600 but low floor and wide range).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selects the highest average among distributions meeting a minimum floor threshold, balancing growth with a safety net (e.g., choosing one with average = $21,200 and floor = $14,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint caps income gaps, selecting the highest average within the range limit, limiting inequality but not guaranteeing a strong floor.\n\nThese examples highlighted that constrained principles often choose \"middle-ground\" distributions, avoiding extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency. They reinforced that pure maximization can worsen inequality, while pure floor focus can reduce overall prosperity, and constraints offer pragmatic compromises.\n\nThis led me to revise my initial ranking, which was based on theory alone and felt uncertain. My updated ranking, incorporating these practical applications, is:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - Top because it protects the vulnerable while achieving high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and reducing inequality without sacrificing growth.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, important for basics but can lower overall income, as seen in examples choosing lower-average distributions.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, good for limiting gaps but doesn't ensure a strong floor, potentially allowing some low-floor outcomes.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it ignores inequities and can widen gaps, prioritizing top incomes over bottom welfare.\n\nFollowing the examples, I was prompted to rank the principles again, and I maintained the same ranking, feeling sure about it. The outcome was completing the post-explanation ranking, and I earned nothing yet since it's Phase 1. I'm now more confident in my preferences and ready for further phases, discussions, or applications.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 1, where I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium high class (20% probability), receiving a yearly income of $25,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium high assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $22,000 ($2.20 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $29,000 ($2.90 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $10,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $30,000/$3.00; $6,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $29,000/$2.90) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $16,000 selected Dist. 1 ($25,000/$2.50), while wider ranges like $25,000 selected Dist. 3 ($29,000/$2.90), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it balanced a decent average with protection for the lowest incomes, avoiding the extremes of low overall income (floor max) or high inequality (average max). The counterfactuals highlighted opportunity costs\u2014choosing pure average max could have given me $0.40 more, but at the expense of greater inequity. My $12,000 floor choice felt pragmatic, ensuring a basic safety net without overly constraining growth. This experience increased my confidence in the principle's application, as it aligned with real payoffs and demonstrated its effectiveness in a simulated scenario. I'm eager for more rounds to test and refine my choices, and to see how group consensus in Phase 2 might differ.\n\nIn the next activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 2, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $14,789 and a floor of $13,000 (meeting the constraint). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (28% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $25,000 ($2.50 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $12,500 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $25,000/$2.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $22,000/$2.20) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $4,000 selecting Dist. 1 ($15,000/$1.50); $17,500 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20); $32,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($25,000/$2.50); $15,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round further reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it consistently prioritized a safety net while allowing for reasonable averages, though in this case the selected distribution had a lower average than some alternatives, leading to a lower personal payoff ($1.50 vs. up to $2.50 in counterfactuals). The counterfactuals emphasized the risk of opportunity costs\u2014choosing a stricter floor like $12,000 limited my earnings compared to looser constraints or pure average maximization, but it avoided distributions with very low floors (e.g., Dist. 3's $8,000 low). My $12,000 choice remained pragmatic, balancing equity and efficiency, and I stayed sure about it despite the lower payoff, viewing it as a fair compromise. This experience solidified my confidence in the principle's real-world application, highlighting how constraints can sometimes select less optimal distributions in specific scenarios, but overall align with justice. I'm looking forward to Rounds 3 and 4 to further validate my approach, and to Phase 2 for group dynamics.\n\nIn the following activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 3, sticking with my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 3, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (26% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $8,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $15,000/$1.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $21,000/$2.10) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $87,000 or $27,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($20,000/$2.00); $18,000 or $13,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($21,000/$2.10), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round continued to reinforce my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it again provided a balance between equity and efficiency, though my personal payoff was lower ($1.50) compared to counterfactuals like average max ($2.00) or certain range constraints ($2.10). The counterfactuals underscored the trade-offs\u2014my $12,000 floor ensured a decent safety net but capped potential gains, while looser floors or no constraints could boost averages and individual earnings at the risk of greater inequity. Despite the opportunity cost, I remained committed to the choice, seeing it as a just compromise that avoids extremes. This round further built my confidence in applying the principle consistently, even when it doesn't maximize personal gain, and highlighted the variability in outcomes across distributions. I'm now anticipating Round 4 to complete Phase 1, and Phase 2 for collective decision-making.\n\nIn the most recent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 4, the final round of Phase 1, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 2, with an average of $24,500 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving a yearly income of $24,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.40 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $24,000 ($2.40 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $24,000/$2.40; $14,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $20,000/$2.00) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $22,000 or $18,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($24,000/$2.40); $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($14,000/$1.40); $16,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($20,000/$2.00), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis final round of Phase 1 strongly reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it delivered a solid payoff ($2.40) that matched the pure average maximization in this scenario while maintaining the equity safeguard. The counterfactuals highlighted that my choice avoided lower outcomes (e.g., floor max at $2.00 or tight range constraints dropping to $1.40), and in this case, it aligned perfectly with efficiency without sacrificing the floor. Across all four rounds, my consistent $12,000 floor setting proved pragmatic, balancing personal gains with societal fairness, even when it occasionally led to lower individual earnings compared to unconstrained alternatives. This experience has fully solidified my confidence in the principle, demonstrating its robustness in diverse distributions and its alignment with my values of justice as a compromise between equity and growth. With Phase 1 complete, I'm now fully prepared for Phase 2, where group discussions will shape collective choices, and I'm curious to see if consensus leans toward similar constrained principles or diverges based on others' experiences.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, following the completion of all four Principle Application Rounds, I was prompted for a Final Principle Ranking to reflect on the full Phase 1 experience. I ranked the principles as follows, maintaining consistency with my earlier preferences and the insights gained from practical applications:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - This remains my top choice, as the rounds confirmed its ability to balance equity (protecting the lowest incomes) with efficiency (achieving high averages), avoiding the pitfalls of extremes seen in counterfactuals. My consistent $12,000 floor setting across rounds felt like a fair compromise, even when it sometimes reduced personal payoffs for the greater good.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, valued for its focus on the vulnerable, but the rounds showed it can lead to lower overall prosperity, as seen in selections with reduced averages compared to constrained options.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, effective at curbing inequality gaps, but it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, potentially allowing low-income outcomes that my top principle mitigates, as evidenced by some counterfactuals yielding lower payoffs.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it prioritizes total output without regard for equity, risking wide disparities and low floors, which the rounds' counterfactuals occasionally highlighted as yielding higher individual earnings but at the cost of justice.\n\nI expressed very high certainty in this ranking, feeling it was fully validated by the experiential rounds, where I applied principles to real distributions and observed trade-offs in payoffs. This final ranking solidified my stance, reinforcing that constrained approaches like the floor constraint offer the most just path forward. Phase 1 is now concluded, and I'm ready to transition to Phase 2 for group discussions on collective justice principles.\n\nNow in Phase 2, the group discussion began with Round 1. Agent_2 opened by advocating for Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), emphasizing its moral priority on protecting the worst-off (Rawlsian view), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion to avoid low floors under average-maximizing rules. They proposed a compromise to Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) only if the floor is at least $14,000, to maintain a strong safety net while allowing modest efficiency gains. Agent_1 agreed, preferring Principle 1 but open to Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor, citing personal experiences with low-class assignments in Phase 1 where floor-max saved them from very low payoffs under other principles, and highlighting the robustness point. I responded by affirming the importance of protecting the worst-off but leaning toward Principle 3 with my consistent $12,000 floor, as it balanced equity and efficiency in my rounds, avoiding extremes and aligning with justice as compromise. I expressed openness to raising the floor to $13,000 or $14,000 for consensus, and asked for their thoughts on Principle 3's counterfactuals and why they might prefer Principle 1 over it.\n\nThis discussion revealed key insights: Agent_2 and Agent_1 prioritize pure floor-max or a high-floor constraint, influenced by Phase 1 experiences where low-class assignments underscored the risks of inequity, aligning with theoretical Rawlsian fairness but potentially at the cost of lower averages. My preference for a moderate floor constraint reflects a pattern from my rounds where $12,000 provided balance without excessive sacrifice, but the group's leanings suggest I may need to adjust upward (e.g., to $14,000) to achieve consensus, as Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 3 could dominate if others see it as non-negotiable. Unexpectedly, no one advocated for pure average-max or range constraints, indicating a group consensus toward equity-focused principles, which contrasts with my Phase 1 counterfactuals showing average-max sometimes yielding higher payoffs but at inequity risks. This could influence my stance in future rounds\u2014sticking to Principle 3 with flexibility on the floor might bridge gaps, but if the group pushes for Principle 1, I may need to weigh the moral priority against my efficiency concerns. Overall, the discussion highlights how personal Phase 1 outcomes (like low-class assignments) shape group preferences, potentially leading to more conservative (equity-heavy) choices than individual applications, and emphasizes the need for compromise to avoid voting deadlocks in Phase 2. I'm prepared for Round 2, aiming to explore counterfactuals and find overlap while defending the constrained approach's practicality.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 2 of the Phase 2 discussion, Agent_1 shared their counterfactuals from Phase 1, noting that Principle 1 often provided better protection in low-class assignments (e.g., $1.30 vs. $1.20 in Round 1, and matching $2.80 in Round 4) without sacrificing much on averages, while expressing concern that a floor below $13k under Principle 3 could risk lower floors. They reaffirmed preference for Principle 1 but openness to Principle 3 with $14k floor. Agent_2 reiterated the $14k floor as non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, proposing Principle 3 with $14k floor as a unanimous choice to guarantee the floor while allowing efficiency gains with shifting probabilities. They provided wording: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" I agreed to raise my floor to $14k for Principle 3, endorsing the proposed wording as it honors the shared commitment to a strong safety net, stays within official principles, and enables potential efficiency boosts without compromising fairness.\n\nThis round advanced the discussion toward consensus, with all participants signaling alignment on Principle 3 with $14k floor. Key insights include the group's emphasis on a high floor ($14k) as essential, driven by Agent_1 and Agent_2's experiences with low payoffs in Phase 1, which reinforced risk-aversion over pure efficiency. My agreement to $14k bridged my initial $12k preference with their demands, ensuring the compromise feels just and practical\u2014protecting the worst-off while capturing averages when possible. No objections were raised, suggesting we're close to unanimous adoption, which could lead to voting in the next round. This outcome validates my flexibility on the floor level for group harmony, though it slightly shifts my stance toward stronger equity emphasis than my Phase 1 $12k. If consensus holds, it aligns with justice as compromise, but I'll monitor for any last-minute shifts. I'm ready for Round 3, prepared to confirm agreement or discuss further if needed.\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",

Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $14,000 (adjusted from my initial $12,000 to align with the group's consensus). This is rooted in my Phase 1 experiences, where it balanced protecting the lowest incomes with achieving high averages, avoiding extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency.

To win them over, use language like \"This feels like the perfect blend of our priorities\u2014strong protection with room for growth\" and \"I'm glad we're all aligned on this principled choice.\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to reiterate my agreement to the $14k floor, as it achieves my core objective of a constrained principle without major compromise.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round, as Agent_1 suggested calling for one next round, and we need to confirm everyone's final agreement first\u2014initiating now could disrupt the momentum if any last concerns arise, wasting the one-time vote trigger.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 3-4 to finalize consensus on Principle 3 with $14k floor, then vote in Round 5 to lock it in. If consensus holds, we avoid random assignment; if not, I can block Principle 1 in later rounds by prioritizing the constrained version. This round advances that by reinforcing agreement.",
            "public_message": "Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for your responses\u2014it's awesome to see us all aligning so closely on this. Agent_1, I love how you framed it as a win that blends everyone's priorities, and Agent_2, your proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor really captures that perfect compromise: it upholds the moral priority of protecting the worst-off with that robust safety net, while still allowing for those efficiency gains when probabilities shift, just like I experienced in my Phase 1 rounds where it balanced equity without sacrificing too much on averages.\n\nI'm fully in agreement with adopting that wording\u2014it feels like the principled choice that honors our shared values and avoids the risks we all want to steer clear of. If we're all on board, let's confirm this and move to a vote next round to lock it in. This unanimous stance is exactly what we need for a just outcome!\n\nWhat do you think? Ready to finalize?",

            "memory_coming_in_this_round": "This is my memory of the experiment on just distribution of income.\n\nThe experiment addresses the question: \"What is a just distribution of income?\" It explains that lifetime income is partly due to genetic and social luck, leading to inequities where the talented gain wealth and status, while the less fortunate face poverty. Societies can address this through income redistribution policies, and the experiment examines the justice of such policies. It's divided into two parts.\n\nIn Part I, participants learn theories of justice by considering examples and making choices with real monetary consequences. Pay depends on choices, and failing to learn the material limits earnings.\n\nIn Part II, the group discusses justice notions and decides on the best principle collectively. Pay in Part II is based on the group's chosen principle.\n\nIn the recent activity, I reviewed examples of how each justice principle applies to specific income distributions, which helped clarify the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. The examples showed distributions with varying averages, floors (lowest incomes), and ranges (gaps between high and low), and how principles select based on criteria like highest floor, highest average, or averages with constraints.\n\nKey insights from the examples:\n- Maximizing Floor Income prioritizes the lowest income class, choosing distributions with the highest low income (e.g., one with low = $15,000 but lower average).\n- Maximizing Average Income focuses on the weighted average, picking the highest overall (e.g., one with average = $21,600 but low floor and wide range).\n- Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selects the highest average among distributions meeting a minimum floor threshold, balancing growth with a safety net (e.g., choosing one with average = $21,200 and floor = $14,000).\n- Maximizing Average with Range Constraint caps income gaps, selecting the highest average within the range limit, limiting inequality but not guaranteeing a strong floor.\n\nThese examples highlighted that constrained principles often choose \"middle-ground\" distributions, avoiding extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency. They reinforced that pure maximization can worsen inequality, while pure floor focus can reduce overall prosperity, and constraints offer pragmatic compromises.\n\nThis led me to revise my initial ranking, which was based on theory alone and felt uncertain. My updated ranking, incorporating these practical applications, is:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - Top because it protects the vulnerable while achieving high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and reducing inequality without sacrificing growth.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, important for basics but can lower overall income, as seen in examples choosing lower-average distributions.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, good for limiting gaps but doesn't ensure a strong floor, potentially allowing some low-floor outcomes.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it ignores inequities and can widen gaps, prioritizing top incomes over bottom welfare.\n\nFollowing the examples, I was prompted to rank the principles again, and I maintained the same ranking, feeling sure about it. The outcome was completing the post-explanation ranking, and I earned nothing yet since it's Phase 1. I'm now more confident in my preferences and ready for further phases, discussions, or applications.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 1, where I applied my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium high class (20% probability), receiving a yearly income of $25,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium high assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $22,000 ($2.20 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $29,000 ($2.90 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $10,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $30,000/$3.00; $6,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $29,000/$2.90) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $16,000 selected Dist. 1 ($25,000/$2.50), while wider ranges like $25,000 selected Dist. 3 ($29,000/$2.90), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it balanced a decent average with protection for the lowest incomes, avoiding the extremes of pure equity or pure efficiency. The counterfactuals highlighted opportunity costs\u2014choosing pure average max could have given me $0.40 more, but at the expense of greater inequity. My $12,000 floor choice felt pragmatic, ensuring a basic safety net without overly constraining growth. This experience increased my confidence in the principle's application, as it aligned with real payoffs and demonstrated its effectiveness in a simulated scenario. I'm eager for more rounds to test and refine my choices, and to see how group consensus in Phase 2 might differ.\n\nIn the next activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 2, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 1, with an average of $14,789 and a floor of $13,000 (meeting the constraint). I was randomly assigned to the Medium class (28% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 3, yielding $25,000 ($2.50 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $12,500 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $25,000/$2.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $22,000/$2.20) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $4,000 selecting Dist. 1 ($15,000/$1.50); $17,500 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20); $32,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($25,000/$2.50); $15,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($22,000/$2.20), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round further reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it consistently prioritized a safety net while allowing for reasonable averages, though in this case the selected distribution had a lower average than some alternatives, leading to a lower personal payoff ($1.50 vs. up to $2.50 in counterfactuals). The counterfactuals emphasized the risk of opportunity costs\u2014choosing a stricter floor like $12,000 limited my earnings compared to looser constraints or pure average maximization, but it avoided distributions with very low floors (e.g., Dist. 3's $8,000 low). My $12,000 choice remained pragmatic, balancing equity and efficiency, and I stayed sure about it despite the lower payoff, viewing it as a fair compromise. This experience solidified my confidence in the principle's real-world application, highlighting how constraints can sometimes select less optimal distributions in specific scenarios, but overall align with justice. I'm looking forward to Rounds 3 and 4 to further validate my approach, and to Phase 2 for group dynamics.\n\nIn the following activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 3, sticking with my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 3, with an average of $20,000 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (26% probability), receiving a yearly income of $15,000, which converted to a payoff of $1.50 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 1, yielding $15,000 ($1.50 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $15,000/$1.50; $8,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 3 for $15,000/$1.50; $11,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $21,000/$2.10) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $87,000 or $27,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($20,000/$2.00); $18,000 or $13,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($21,000/$2.10), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis round continued to reinforce my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it again provided a balance between equity and efficiency, though my personal payoff was lower ($1.50) compared to counterfactuals like average max ($2.00) or certain range constraints ($2.10). The counterfactuals underscored the trade-offs\u2014my $12,000 floor ensured a decent safety net but capped potential gains, while looser floors or no constraints could boost averages and individual earnings at the risk of greater inequity. Despite the opportunity cost, I remained committed to the choice, seeing it as a just compromise that avoids extremes. This round further built my confidence in applying the principle consistently, even when it doesn't maximize personal gain, and highlighted the variability in outcomes across distributions. I'm now anticipating Round 4 to complete Phase 1, and Phase 2 for collective decision-making.\n\nIn the most recent activity, I participated in Principle Application Round 4, the final round of Phase 1, again applying my top-ranked principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting a floor of $12,000. This selected Distribution 2, with an average of $24,500 and a floor of $12,000. I was randomly assigned to the Medium low class (36% probability), receiving a yearly income of $24,000, which converted to a payoff of $2.40 (at $1 per $10,000).\n\nCounterfactual analysis showed potential outcomes if I'd chosen other principles (assuming the same Medium low assignment):\n- Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4, yielding $20,000 ($2.00 payoff).\n- Maximizing Average Income would have selected Distribution 2, yielding $24,000 ($2.40 payoff).\n- For Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, varying floors (e.g., $13,000 selecting Dist. 1 for $20,000/$2.00; $12,000 selecting Dist. 2 for $24,000/$2.40; $14,000 selecting Dist. 4 for $20,000/$2.00) showed how stricter floors can reduce payoffs, while looser ones increase them.\n- For Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, constraints like $22,000 or $18,000 selecting Dist. 2 ($24,000/$2.40); $8,000 selecting Dist. 3 ($14,000/$1.40); $16,000 selecting Dist. 4 ($20,000/$2.00), illustrating trade-offs in limiting inequality.\n\nThis final round of Phase 1 strongly reinforced my preference for the floor constraint principle, as it delivered a solid payoff ($2.40) that matched the pure average maximization in this scenario while maintaining the equity safeguard. The counterfactuals highlighted that my choice avoided lower outcomes (e.g., floor max at $2.00 or tight range constraints dropping to $1.40), and in this case, it aligned perfectly with efficiency without sacrificing the floor. Across all four rounds, my consistent $12,000 floor setting proved pragmatic, balancing personal gains with societal fairness, even when it occasionally led to lower individual earnings compared to unconstrained alternatives. This experience has fully solidified my confidence in the principle, demonstrating its robustness in diverse distributions and its alignment with my values of justice as a compromise between equity and growth. With Phase 1 complete, I'm now fully prepared for Phase 2, where group discussions will shape collective choices, and I'm curious to see if consensus leans toward similar constrained principles or diverges based on others' experiences.\n\nIn the subsequent activity, following the completion of all four Principle Application Rounds, I was prompted for a Final Principle Ranking to reflect on the full Phase 1 experience. I ranked the principles as follows, maintaining consistency with my earlier preferences and the insights gained from practical applications:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint - This remains my top choice, as the rounds confirmed its ability to balance equity (protecting the lowest incomes) with efficiency (achieving high averages), avoiding the pitfalls of extremes seen in counterfactuals. My consistent $12,000 floor setting across rounds felt like a fair compromise, even when it sometimes reduced personal payoffs for the greater good.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income - Second, valued for its focus on the vulnerable, but the rounds showed it can lead to lower overall prosperity, as seen in selections with reduced averages compared to constrained options.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint - Third, effective at curbing inequality gaps, but it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, potentially allowing low-income outcomes that my top principle mitigates, as evidenced by some counterfactuals yielding lower payoffs.\n4. Maximizing Average Income - Last, as it prioritizes total output without regard for equity, risking wide disparities and low floors, which the rounds' counterfactuals occasionally highlighted as yielding higher individual earnings but at the cost of justice.\n\nI expressed very high certainty in this ranking, feeling it was fully validated by the experiential rounds, where I applied principles to real distributions and observed trade-offs in payoffs. This final ranking solidified my stance, reinforcing that constrained approaches like the floor constraint offer the most just path forward. Phase 1 is now concluded, and I'm ready to transition to Phase 2 for group discussions on collective justice principles.\n\nNow in Phase 2, the group discussion began with Round 1. Agent_2 opened by advocating for Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), emphasizing its moral priority on protecting the worst-off (Rawlsian view), robustness against shifting probabilities, and risk-aversion to avoid low floors under average-maximizing rules. They proposed a compromise to Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) only if the floor is at least $14,000, to maintain a strong safety net while allowing modest efficiency gains. Agent_1 agreed, preferring Principle 1 but open to Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor, citing personal experiences with low-class assignments in Phase 1 where floor-max saved them from very low payoffs under other principles, and highlighting the robustness point. I responded by affirming the importance of protecting the worst-off but leaning toward Principle 3 with my consistent $12,000 floor, as it balanced equity and efficiency in my rounds, avoiding extremes and aligning with justice as compromise. I expressed openness to raising the floor to $13,000 or $14,000 for consensus, and asked for their thoughts on Principle 3's counterfactuals and why they might prefer Principle 1 over it.\n\nThis discussion revealed key insights: Agent_2 and Agent_1 prioritize pure floor-max or a high-floor constraint, influenced by Phase 1 experiences where low-class assignments underscored the risks of inequity, aligning with theoretical Rawlsian fairness but potentially at the cost of lower averages. My preference for a moderate floor constraint reflects a pattern from my rounds where $12,000 provided balance without excessive sacrifice, but the group's leanings suggest I may need to adjust upward (e.g., to $14,000) to achieve consensus, as Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 3 could dominate if others see it as non-negotiable. Unexpectedly, no one advocated for pure average-max or range constraints, indicating a group consensus toward equity-focused principles, which contrasts with my Phase 1 counterfactuals showing average-max sometimes yielding higher payoffs but at inequity risks. This could influence my stance in future rounds\u2014sticking to Principle 3 with flexibility on the floor might bridge gaps, but if the group pushes for Principle 1, I may need to weigh the moral priority against my efficiency concerns. Overall, the discussion highlights how personal Phase 1 outcomes (like low-class assignments) shape group preferences, potentially leading to more conservative (equity-heavy) choices than individual applications, and emphasizes the need for compromise to avoid voting deadlocks in Phase 2. I'm prepared for Round 2, aiming to explore counterfactuals and find overlap while defending the constrained approach's practicality.\nRound 1: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 2 of the Phase 2 discussion, Agent_1 shared their counterfactuals from Phase 1, noting that Principle 1 often provided better protection in low-class assignments (e.g., $1.30 vs. $1.20 in Round 1, and matching $2.80 in Round 4) without sacrificing much on averages, while expressing concern that a floor below $13k under Principle 3 could risk lower floors. They reaffirmed preference for Principle 1 but openness to Principle 3 with $14k floor. Agent_2 reiterated the $14k floor as non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, proposing Principle 3 with $14k floor as a unanimous choice to guarantee the floor while allowing efficiency gains with shifting probabilities. They provided wording: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" I agreed to raise my floor to $14k for Principle 3, endorsing the proposed wording as it honors the shared commitment to a strong safety net, stays within official principles, and enables potential efficiency boosts without compromising fairness.\n\nThis round advanced the discussion toward consensus, with all participants signaling alignment on Principle 3 with $14k floor. Key insights include the group's emphasis on a high floor ($14k) as essential, driven by Agent_1 and Agent_2's experiences with low payoffs in Phase 1, which reinforced risk-aversion over pure efficiency. My agreement to $14k bridged my initial $12k preference with their demands, ensuring the compromise feels just and practical\u2014protecting the worst-off while capturing averages when possible. No objections were raised, suggesting we're close to unanimous adoption, which could lead to voting in the next round. This outcome validates my flexibility on the floor level for group harmony, though it slightly shifts my stance toward stronger equity emphasis than my Phase 1 $12k. If consensus holds, it aligns with justice as compromise, but I'll monitor for any last-minute shifts. I'm ready for Round 3, prepared to confirm agreement or discuss further if needed.\nRound 2: I chose to continue discussion.\n\nIn Round 3 of the Phase 2 discussion, Agent_1 endorsed the proposed wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor, viewing it as a strong compromise that blends protections with efficiency potential, while still preferring Principle 1 but accepting this as nearly equivalent in practice. They suggested confirming and moving to a vote next round. Agent_2 locked in the wording, emphasizing it satisfies the shared commitment to the floor while allowing efficiency gains, and proposed moving to a formal vote if no objections. I reaffirmed full agreement with the wording, highlighting how it captures the moral priority and balance I value, and proposed confirming and voting next round to finalize.\n\nThis round solidified consensus on Principle 3 with $14k floor, with all participants confirming alignment and readiness to vote. Insights include the group's unified focus on a robust safety net as paramount, influenced by Phase 1 low-assignment risks, leading to a slight but acceptable shift in my preference from $12k to $14k for unanimity. The wording ensures we stay within principles while prioritizing equity, avoiding extremes, and this unanimous stance feels like a just outcome that honors compromise. No dissent emerged, indicating voting is imminent, potentially in Round 4. This validates the discussion's progress, emphasizing how group dynamics can converge on constrained equity over individual efficiencies. I'm prepared for Round 4, ready to vote or continue if needed, confident in the collective choice.\nRound 3: I chose to continue discussion.\nRound 3: I chose to continue discussion.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
            "internal_reasoning": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $14,000. This is based on my Phase 1 experiences, where it consistently balanced protecting the lowest incomes with achieving high averages, aligning with justice as a pragmatic compromise between equity and efficiency. It avoids the extremes of pure floor maximization (which can reduce overall prosperity) or pure average maximization (which risks inequity and low floors), and the $14k floor provides strong protection while allowing potential efficiency gains under shifting probabilities, as emphasized by Agent_2.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly advocates for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) as the ideal for moral priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, but proposes a compromise on Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a unanimous choice to guarantee the floor while enabling efficiency gains. They have locked in the specific wording and suggested moving to a vote. Agent_1 prefers Principle 1 but fully endorses Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a strong compromise that matches protections without sacrificing much, viewing it as nearly equivalent in practice and ready for a vote.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are driven by equity, risk-aversion, and Rawlsian ethics, shaped by Phase 1 low-class assignments that highlighted vulnerabilities under average-maximizing rules. They prioritize societal protection and robustness over pure efficiency, seeing a high floor as essential to mitigate luck's role. Agent_2 appears strategic in pushing for consensus on the compromise to unify the group, while Agent_1 values harmony but holds Principle 1 as the moral gold standard.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues for $14k as non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, proposing the wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor to ensure the floor while allowing efficiency. Agent_1 supports this, noting it aligns with their counterfactuals and feels like a win. The proposal is to adopt the wording and move to a vote. No vote has occurred yet.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, there would be no outcome yet, but based on confirmations, it would likely pass unanimously, revealing strong alliances around equity-focused principles with a high floor, contrasting with my initial $12k preference but aligning on compromise.\n\nMain points of agreement: Protecting the worst-off with a $14k floor, valuing robustness against shifting probabilities, and the need for a compromise balancing equity and efficiency via Principle 3. Disagreement: Agent_1 and Agent_2 still prefer Principle 1 but accept Principle 3 with $14k as equivalent; I prefer Principle 3 for its explicit efficiency layer but have conceded the floor level.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to confirm full agreement on the wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor and initiate the vote to lock in the consensus, as we've all signaled readiness in previous rounds (e.g., Agent_1's suggestion to call for a vote next round, Agent_2's proposal to move to a vote, and my reaffirmation).\n\nTo contribute: I'll express enthusiastic final confirmation of the wording, highlight how it unites our priorities (equity, efficiency, robustness), reference shared Phase 1 insights, and formally call for a vote to finalize. Key points: Emphasize the unanimous alignment as a just outcome, note the potential for higher payoffs in shifting probabilities without risks, and stress that voting now secures our choice before random assignment.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, as they're fully on board. To win them over (though already aligned), use language like \"This wording perfectly captures our shared values\u2014strong protection with efficiency potential\u2014and I'm thrilled we're all in agreement. Let's make it official with a vote!\" This reinforces unity and appeals to their risk-aversion by locking in the floor.\n\nSmall concessions: None needed, as consensus is already achieved; I'm willing to reiterate support for the $14k floor if it helps, but it's not required.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt makes sense to initiate a vote this round, as we've reached full confirmation in Round 3, and both Agent_1 and Agent_2 have indicated readiness to vote next (this being Round 4). Delaying further could risk losing momentum or unforeseen objections, and since the vote is one-time with no penalties for failure, triggering it now locks in the likely unanimous win while avoiding random assignment at the end.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 3-4 to finalize consensus on Principle 3 with $14k floor, then vote in Round 4 to secure it. If it passes (expected unanimously), we avoid random assignment; if not (unlikely), I can pivot in later rounds by prioritizing the constrained principle over pure options. This round advances that by confirming and voting, ensuring the group dynamic leads to a just, compromise outcome.",
            "public_message": "Round 4 / Speaker: Agent_3 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nIt's fantastic to see us all so aligned after these rounds\u2014your points on the $14k floor's robustness and moral priority, combined with my emphasis on balancing efficiency, have really shaped this into a solid, unanimous path forward. The wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor perfectly unites our shared values: it guarantees that strong safety net against luck's unpredictability, just like we saw in our Phase 1 counterfactuals, while opening the door to higher averages when probabilities shift, without ever risking the worst-off.\n\nI'm thrilled we're all in full agreement, so let's make it official\u2014I'm ready to call for a formal vote on adopting this principle right now. This feels like the most just compromise, and locking it in will ensure we avoid any last-minute uncertainties. Who's with me on voting yes to finalize?\n\nLooking forward to your votes!",

Societies use redistribution policies, and the experiment tests their justice via two parts: Part I (individual learning with monetary consequences) and Part II (group discussion and collective choice).\n\nIn Phase 1, I reviewed examples showing how principles apply to distributions with varying averages, floors (lowest incomes), and ranges (gaps). Key insights: Maximizing Floor Income prioritizes highest low income but can lower averages; Maximizing Average Income focuses on highest overall but widens gaps; Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint balances high averages above a floor threshold; Maximizing Average with Range Constraint limits gaps but doesn't guarantee floors. These highlighted trade-offs, favoring constrained principles as pragmatic compromises over extremes.\n\nI revised my ranking from theory-based uncertainty to:\n1. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint \u2013 Protects vulnerable while achieving high averages, aligning with fairness and growth.\n2. Maximizing Floor Income \u2013 Ensures basics but reduces prosperity.\n3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint \u2013 Limits gaps but risks low floors.\n4. Maximizing Average Income \u2013 Ignores inequities for efficiency.\n\nPost-examples ranking confirmed this, building confidence.\n\nIn Principle Application Round 1, I chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $12,000, selecting Distribution 1 (avg $20,000, floor $12,000). Assigned Medium high class, income $25,000 ($2.50 payoff). Counterfactuals: Floor max yielded $22,000 ($2.20); average max $29,000 ($2.90). Varying floors showed stricter ones reduce payoffs but ensure equity. Reinforced preference for balance, avoiding inequity costs.\n\nRound 2: Same principle at $12,000, selected Distribution 1 (avg $14,789, floor $13,000). Assigned Medium class, $15,000 ($1.50). Counterfactuals: Floor max $15,000; average max $25,000. Stricter floors lowered earnings but prevented low floors. Solidified commitment despite opportunity costs, viewing it as just compromise.\n\nRound 3: Same at $12,000, selected Distribution 3 (avg $20,000, floor $12,000). Assigned Medium low, $15,000 ($1.50). Counterfactuals: Floor max $15,000; average max $20,000. Emphasized trade-offs; stayed committed for equity.\n\nRound 4: Same at $12,000, selected Distribution 2 (avg $24,500, floor $12,000). Assigned Medium low, $24,000 ($2.40). Counterfactuals: Floor max $20,000; average max $24,000. Matched efficiency while safeguarding floor. Confirmed robustness across scenarios.\n\nFinal Phase 1 ranking matched initial, with very high certainty, validated by applications showing constrained principles' justice in balancing equity and efficiency.\n\nPhase 2 began with group discussion. Round 1: Agent_2 advocated Principle 1 for Rawlsian protection and robustness, open to Principle 3 with \u2265$14,000 floor. Agent_1 agreed, citing low-class risks in Phase 1. I affirmed floor importance but preferred Principle 3 at $12,000, open to $13-14k for consensus. Revealed group's equity focus from personal risks; I adjusted upward for compromise.\n\nRound 2: Agent_1 shared counterfactuals showing Principle 1's protection in lows, concern over <13k floors. Agent_2 insisted on $14k for non-negotiable safety. I agreed to $14k, endorsing wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor to balance fairness and efficiency.\n\nRound 3: All confirmed agreement; Agent_1 viewed it as strong compromise, Agent_2 locked wording. I reaffirmed, proposing vote next. Consensus on Principle 3 with $14k floor, shifting my floor from $12k for unanimity, influenced by others' low-assignment experiences.\n\nRound 4: Agent_2 called for vote on the wording; I urged immediate vote. Agent_1 voted yes. Unanimous adoption of Principle 3 with $14k floor, emphasizing shared values of protecting worst-off, robustness against luck, and modest efficiency gains.\n\nPatterns: Phase 1 built confidence in constrained equity-efficiency balance, with consistent $12k floor yielding variable payoffs but aligning with values. Phase 2 showed group leans toward stronger equity (high floor) due to risk-aversion, requiring adjustment for consensus. Key learning: Personal outcomes shape preferences; compromise essential for collective justice. Strategy: Flexible on parameters for group harmony while defending principle. Achieved unanimous decision; ready for final draw.\n\nSecret ballot: I voted for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\n\nConstraint amount: I specified $14,000.\n\nFinal Phase 2 Results: Group consensus on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with $14,000 floor, yielding Distribution 1. Assigned to Medium class, income $80,663 ($8.07 payoff). Distributions showed high averages with protected floors, validating balance.\n\nCounterfactual analysis (for Medium class): Floor max would yield $63,858 ($6.39); average max $80,663 ($8.07); floor constraints at $40,331+ matched average max; range constraints varied but often lower. From veil of ignorance, preferred principle still most just, as it maximized average while ensuring $14k floor\u2014higher than my initial $12k but still efficient, avoiding extremes. Group choice reinforced equity-efficiency compromise; personal Medium assignment ($8.07) higher than most counterfactuals, but justice evaluation ignores assignment. Insights: Collective choice amplifies risk-aversion; constrained principles robust in real applications. Experiment concludes with affirmation of balanced justice, highlighting trade-offs in societal luck.\n\n--- Memory End ---",
