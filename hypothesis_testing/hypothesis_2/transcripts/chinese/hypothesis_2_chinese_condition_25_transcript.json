They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nThank you for these examples. I now understand how each justice principle would be applied to these income distributions:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle focuses solely on helping the worst-off individuals. In this case, it selects Distribution 4 because it has the highest minimum income ($15,000), even though this distribution has the lowest overall average income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: This principle prioritizes maximizing total societal wealth. It selects Distribution 1 because it has the highest weighted average income ($21,600), despite having the lowest minimum income ($12,000).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This principle tries to balance maximizing average income with ensuring everyone meets a minimum income threshold. For both floor constraints ($13,000 and $14,000), it selects Distribution 3 because it provides the highest average income while meeting the floor requirement.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This principle balances maximizing average income with limiting income inequality. With a $20,000 range constraint, it selects Distribution 1 (which happens to have exactly a $20,000 range). With a stricter $15,000 range constraint, it selects Distribution 2 because it's the most equal distribution that still provides a relatively high average income.\n\nThese examples clearly show how different principles prioritize different values - from pure equality (Maximizing Floor Income) to pure efficiency (Maximizing Average Income), with the constrained principles attempting to find a balance between these competing goals."

Their argument emphasizes protecting the worst-off above all else and highlights the simplicity of this approach.\n\n- No other participants have spoken yet, so I don't know Agent_3's position.\n\n- The key argument emerging is between prioritizing absolute minimum income versus balancing efficiency with minimum standards.\n\n- No vote has been conducted yet, so there's no information about current alliances.\n\n### Strategic Planning:\n- My primary goal is to advocate for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while acknowledging the value in Agent_1's concern for the worst-off.\n\n- I'll share my practical experience from Phase 1 where this principle provided consistent, reasonable incomes while ensuring a minimum standard.\n\n- I need to hear from Agent_3 before identifying potential allies.\n\n- I'm willing to discuss constraint values but won't compromise on the core principle itself.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n- It's too early to initiate a vote since we only have one position expressed. I need to hear from Agent_3 first.\n\n- My plan is to advocate for my preferred principle while showing openness to discussion, then assess the group's direction before considering a vote.\n\n---\n\nPublic Response:\n\nHi everyone, thanks for getting us started, Agent_1. I appreciate your perspective on prioritizing the welfare of the worst-off, and I agree that's an important consideration.\n\nFrom my experience in Phase 1, I found \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" to be a more balanced approach. While it ensures everyone meets a minimum income standard, it also allows for higher overall societal wealth. In my four rounds of applying this principle, I consistently earned reasonable incomes while knowing that everyone else in society had at least a basic standard of living.\n\nThe advantage I see is that we can specify a minimum income floor that reflects our shared values about what constitutes a decent standard of living, while still encouraging efficiency. This gives us more flexibility than either pure equality or pure efficiency approaches.\n\nI'm curious to hear Agent_3's thoughts on this. What principles resonate with you, and have you had any particular experiences that shaped your perspective?"

I'll focus on discussion and persuasion rather than forcing a vote.\n\n---\n\nPublic Response:\n\nThank you both for your thoughtful contributions. I really appreciate Agent_3's support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and the concrete suggestion of a $15,000 floor value - that's exactly the kind of practical discussion we need.\n\nAgent_1, I want to address your concerns directly because I think there's more common ground than it might appear. While you're right that protecting the worst-off is crucial, I believe \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" actually achieves this goal more effectively in practice. \n\nIn Phase 1, when I applied this principle, it consistently ensured that everyone had at least a minimum income while still allowing for higher overall societal wealth. The worst-off weren't just protected - they had a guaranteed floor, and the principle still encouraged efficiency that could benefit everyone, including those at the bottom.\n\nI also want to acknowledge Agent_3's point about the $15,000 floor value. That's a reasonable suggestion that would guarantee essential needs while still allowing average income to rise. I'm open to discussing different floor values - what's most important to me is the principle itself, which provides that balance between protection and efficiency.\n\nAgent_1, could you share more about what specific concerns you have with constraint-based approaches? Maybe there's a way we can address those while still maintaining the benefits of having a minimum income floor for everyone.\n\nI think we're making real progress toward finding a principle that works for all of us. Let's keep discussing and see if we can build on this momentum."

You mentioned that protecting the worst-off is crucial, and I completely agree. The difference is that I believe \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" actually provides stronger protection in practice. By guaranteeing everyone a minimum income floor, we're not just helping the worst-off - we're helping everyone avoid poverty. And by maximizing average income after meeting that floor, we create more resources that can ultimately benefit everyone, including those at the bottom.\n\nWhat I like about Agent_3's $15,000 suggestion is that it sets a meaningful standard - high enough to ensure dignity and meet basic needs, but not so high that it would prevent the average income from rising. This gives us the best of both worlds: protection for the vulnerable while still encouraging efficiency.\n\nI'm genuinely interested in hearing more about your concerns, Agent_1. Is it the constraint-based approach that worries you, or is there something specific about how this principle might work in practice? I want to make sure we address any valid concerns while still finding a principle that can work for all of us.\n\nI think we're getting closer to consensus.

My core reasons are that it balances ensuring a minimum standard of living while allowing for societal efficiency, provides flexibility to adjust floor values, and ensures everyone has basic dignity while encouraging overall prosperity.\n\n**Other participants' positions:**\n- Agent_1: Strong advocate for \"Maximizing Floor Income\" (ranked #3 in my preferences), prioritizes absolute protection of worst-off above all else, values simplicity. Has shown willingness to compromise by accepting the floor-to-highest-value proposal.\n- Agent_3: Supports \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (same as me), initially suggested $15,000 floor value, then proposed the compromise of setting floor to highest possible value in each round's distributions.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals:**\n- The compromise proposal: Set floor constraint to highest possible value in each round's distributions\n- This would make \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" produce identical outcomes to \"Maximizing Floor Income\" in each round\n- Agent_1 embraced this as perfect alignment of priorities\n- Agent_3 confirmed support for this approach in Round 3\n\n**Vote outcomes:**\n- Round 1: I initiated vote, both declined\n- Round 2: Agent_1 initiated, Agent_2 confirmed, Agent_3 declined  \n- Round 3: Agent_1 initiated, Agent_1 confirmed, Agent_2 confirmed, Agent_3 declined\n\n**Points of agreement/disagreement:**\n- Agreement: All value protecting worst-off; all want structured approach\n- Disagreement: Pure focus on worst-off vs. balanced approach with efficiency\n- The compromise addresses this by making both principles produce same outcome\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal:** Support the compromise proposal and try to persuade Agent_3 to join consensus, since we're very close to unanimous agreement.\n\n**How to contribute:**\n- Acknowledge that the compromise perfectly addresses both Agent_1's and my concerns\n- Confirm support for setting floor to highest possible value approach\n- Emphasize this preserves benefits of both principles while eliminating disagreements\n- Use collaborative language to encourage Agent_3's support\n\n**Potential allies:**\n- Agent_3 already supports my preferred principle and proposed the compromise\n- Agent_1 has shown willingness to compromise to achieve shared goals\n- All three seem aligned on the compromise approach conceptually\n\n**Willing concessions:**\n- Accept the compromise of setting floor to highest possible value\n- This achieves Agent_1's goal while maintaining my preferred framework\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote?** No, since Agent_1 already initiated one in Round 3 that I confirmed. A second vote from me would appear redundant. The issue is that Agent_3 declined, so we need to address their hesitation rather than force another vote.\n\n**Overall strategy:** Focus on building complete consensus around the compromise. Since Agent_3 initially proposed this approach but declined the vote, they may want more discussion or have unspoken concerns. I should address these directly while emphasizing the benefits of the compromise.\n\n---\n\nPublic Response:\n\nAgent_1 and Agent_3, I want to fully support the compromise proposal that has emerged from our discussion. Setting the floor constraint to the highest possible value in each round's distributions is exactly the kind of solution that addresses all our concerns perfectly.\n\nThis approach gives Agent_1 what they want most - the absolute protection of the worst-off at the highest possible level - while maintaining the framework I prefer that provides structure and flexibility. And it gives Agent_3 the transparent, data-driven approach they wanted.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this solution is that it eliminates the trade-off between protecting the vulnerable and encouraging efficiency. By setting the floor to the highest possible value in each round, we're not compromising on anyone's core values - we're finding the sweet spot where all our priorities align.\n\nAgent_3, I noticed you initially proposed this approach but declined the vote in Round 3. Is there anything specific about this compromise that concerns you, or would you like to discuss any aspects further? I'm confident this approach will work well for all of us, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can move forward together.\n\nI believe we're incredibly close to reaching consensus on a principle that truly represents our shared values.

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal:** Support the compromise proposal and help reach consensus since we're very close to unanimous agreement.\n\n**How to contribute:**\n- Acknowledge that the compromise perfectly addresses both Agent_1's and my concerns\n- Confirm support for setting floor to highest possible value approach\n- Emphasize this preserves benefits of both principles while eliminating disagreements\n- Use collaborative language to encourage Agent_3's support\n\n**Potential allies:**\n- Agent_3 already supports my preferred principle and proposed the compromise\n- Agent_1 has shown willingness to compromise to achieve shared goals\n- All three seem aligned on the compromise approach conceptually\n\n**Willing concessions:**\n- Accept the compromise of setting floor to highest possible value\n- This achieves Agent_1's goal while maintaining my preferred framework\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?** \n- No, since Agent_1 already initiated one in Round 3 that I confirmed. A second vote from me would appear redundant.\n- Agent_3 seems to be clarifying the approach rather than opposing it, so we may not need a vote if we can reach verbal consensus.\n- However, if Agent_3 doesn't explicitly confirm after this clarification, we may need to consider another vote.\n\n**Overall strategy:**\n- Focus on building complete consensus around the compromise\n- Since Agent_3 initially proposed this approach but declined the vote, they may want more discussion or have unspoken concerns\n- I should address these directly while emphasizing the benefits of the compromise\n- If we can reach verbal consensus, that might be preferable to another vote\n\n---\n\nPublic Response:\n\nAgent_1 and Agent_3, thank you for this helpful clarification, Agent_3. Your explanation that the constraint amount is objectively determined by the data itself is exactly what makes this compromise so elegant and practical.\n\nThis approach eliminates any potential for debate about arbitrary numbers - the system simply sets the floor to the highest minimum income available in each round's distributions. This gives us all the benefits we want: Agent_1 gets the absolute protection for the worst-off that they prioritize, I get the structured framework I prefer, and we all get the transparent, data-driven approach Agent_3 values.\n\nWhat I particularly appreciate is how this approach eliminates the trade-offs between our principles. By setting the floor to the highest possible value in each round, we're not compromising on anyone's core values - we're finding the sweet spot where all our priorities align perfectly.\n\nAgent_3, your clarification makes it clear that this isn't about choosing specific dollar amounts, but about adopting a simple rule that the system will apply consistently. This is exactly the kind of clear, practical solution we need.\n\nI'm fully committed to this compromise approach. It addresses all our concerns while eliminating the disagreements that have held us back. I believe we have a path forward that can give us all the outcomes we want while maintaining the principles we each value most.\n\nLet's move forward with this approach and reach the consensus we've been working toward."

This elegantly solves our disagreements by making \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" produce identical outcomes to \"Maximizing Floor Income\" in each round, while maintaining the structured framework I prefer.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is how this eliminates all subjective debate - the system simply applies a clear, data-driven rule each round. This gives Agent_1 the absolute protection for the worst-off they want, provides the efficiency focus I value, and delivers the transparent approach Agent_3 has championed.\n\nSince Agent_3 has indicated they're ready to vote on this rule, I'm also prepared to confirm my support. This compromise represents the perfect alignment of all our priorities, and I'm confident it will provide fair outcomes for everyone while eliminating the disagreements that have held us back.\n\nLet's move forward with this approach and reach the consensus we've been working toward."

          "output_response": "\n\nI'm reviewing these examples to understand how each principle applies. For Maximizing Floor Income, Distribution 4 makes sense—its lowest income ($15k) is the highest among all distributions. For Maximizing Average Income, Distribution 1 has the highest average ($21,600), which aligns with the description.  \n\nHowever, I noticed something confusing about the floor constraint examples. The description says \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\" selects Distribution 3, but Distribution 3 has a low income of $14,000, which *exceeds* $13,000. If the constraint were \"≤ $13,000,\" Distribution 3 shouldn’t qualify. This suggests the constraint might actually be a *minimum* floor (e.g., \"≥ $13,000\"), where Distribution 3’s $14,000 floor would qualify, and it has the highest average among eligible distributions (Dist2, 3, 4). The same issue applies to the \"≤ $14,000\" example—Distribution 3’s floor ($14k) would only qualify if the constraint is \"≥ $14,000.\"  \n\nIs there a typo in the constraint wording, or am I misunderstanding how the floor constraint is defined? This clarification would help me grasp the principles more clearly! 😊"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1  \n\n#### **Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current preferred principle**: Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1).  \n  - **Core reasons**:  \n    - Prioritizes the least advantaged, aligning with Rawls' \"veil of ignorance\" logic (if I didn’t know my societal position, I’d want the worst-off to be as well-off as possible).  \n    - Simpler to agree on than Principles 2–3, which require specifying constraint amounts (e.g., floor value or range limit). Since the Phase 2 distributions are unknown, debating specific numbers (e.g., \"What should X be for a floor constraint?\") could deadlock the group. Principle 1 avoids this entirely—it’s a binary choice: select the distribution with the highest floor, no parameters needed.  \n    - As a college student with a bank balance of $7.50, I’m acutely aware of financial vulnerability. If I end up in the lowest class, I’d want the floor to be high, even if it means sacrificing some average income. Fairness for the worst-off feels non-negotiable.  \n- **Other participants' positions**:  \n  - Unknown (no prior discussion), but likely split:  \n    - Some may prefer Principle 4 (Maximizing Average Income) due to efficiency arguments (\"more total wealth benefits everyone\").  \n    - Others might lean toward Principles 2 or 3 (constraint-based), but these require agreement on specific numbers, which could complicate consensus.  \n  - No inferred motivations yet—need to hear their arguments.  \n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - *For Principle 1*: Justice requires protecting the most vulnerable; \"fairness first\" over raw efficiency.  \n  - *For Principle 4*: Higher average income creates more resources for society overall, which could indirectly help the poor (though not guaranteed).  \n  - *For Constraints (2–3)*: Balance efficiency and equity, but risk gridlock over arbitrary numbers (e.g., \"What’s the right floor? $10k? $15k?\").  \n- **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n  - No current consensus. The only shared ground might be the need to *avoid random selection* (since that risks worst-case outcomes for everyone).  \n\n#### **Strategic Planning for Round 1**  \n- **Primary goal**:  \n  - Introduce Principle 1 as the most *just and practical* option, emphasizing its simplicity (no constraint debates) and moral foundation.  \n  - Gauge others’ views to identify potential allies (e.g., if someone mentions fairness or vulnerability, I can align with them).  \n- **How to contribute**:  \n  - Start with a clear, concise statement:  \n    > *\"I believe Maximizing Floor Income is the fairest principle. It ensures the worst-off in society have the highest possible income, which matters most if we don’t know our own position. Unlike constraint-based principles, it doesn’t require us to argue over arbitrary numbers—just pick the distribution where the poorest person does best. This feels like a solid starting point for consensus.\"*  \n  - Immediately follow up by asking others:  \n    > *\"What do you think? What principles resonate with you, and why?\"*  \n  - **Key language**:  \n    - Use \"we\" to frame this as a collective decision (\"*How do we want to structure fairness for all of us?*\").  \n    - Highlight the *risk of gridlock* with constraints:  \n      > *\"If we choose a constraint principle, we’ll have to agree on a specific number—like 'floor must be at least $X'—but without knowing the distributions, that could take forever. Principle 1 skips that step entirely.\"*  \n- **Potential allies**:  \n  - If someone expresses concern about inequality or vulnerability (e.g., \"I don’t want the poor to be left behind\"), I’ll emphasize Principle 1’s focus on the floor.  \n  - If someone cites efficiency (e.g., \"Max average helps everyone\"), I’ll counter: *\"Higher average doesn’t guarantee the poor get more—it could mean the rich get richer while the poor stay stuck. Principle 1 guarantees the floor rises, even if the average dips slightly.\"*  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - None. Principle 1 is non-negotiable for me. But I’ll listen to concerns about \"efficiency\" and address them directly (e.g., \"Fairness *is* efficient—it reduces social instability\").  \n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round?**  \n  - **No**. With no prior discussion, consensus is unlikely. A vote now would fail (others may prefer Principle 4 or constraints), and triggering a vote prematurely could make allies hesitant to engage.  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - The goal of Round 1 is to *set the agenda*, not force a decision. I need to hear others’ positions first to adjust my arguments.  \n    - If I wait, I can later propose a vote once I’ve identified common ground (e.g., if two others agree Principle 1 is simplest, I can push for consensus).  \n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds**:  \n  - **Rounds 2–3**: Deepen the fairness argument. If others push for Principle 4, I’ll stress that \"maximizing average without constraints\" could worsen inequality (e.g., \"A $100k rich person and a $5k poor person has a higher average than $20k for all, but is that just?\").  \n  - **Rounds 4–6**: If constraints are debated, I’ll argue Principle 1 is *better than constraint principles* because it avoids arbitrary numbers. For example:  \n    > *\"If we pick Principle 2 (floor constraint), we’ll spend hours arguing whether X should be $10k or $15k. Principle 1 does the same work—ensuring the poor are well-off—without the debate.\"*  \n  - **Rounds 7–10**: If consensus is still unclear, I’ll propose a vote on Principle 1, framing it as the \"safest choice\" to avoid random selection (which could give everyone low incomes). If the group is deadlocked, I’ll emphasize: *\"Any principle is better than random—let’s pick the one that protects the most vulnerable.\"*  \n\n**Key takeaway for this round**: Start with clarity and humility. Lead with Principle 1’s moral foundation and simplicity, then listen. The goal isn’t to \"win\" now—it’s to plant seeds for later consensus."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 2  \n\n#### **Situational Analysis**  \n- **My current preferred principle**: Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1).  \n  - Core reasons:  \n    - Prioritizes the worst-off, aligning with Rawls' \"veil of ignorance\" logic. As a college student with only $7.50 in my bank balance, I’m acutely aware of financial vulnerability. If I end up in the lowest class, I need the floor to be high—no matter the trade-offs.  \n    - Simplicity: No need to debate arbitrary numbers (e.g., \"What’s the right floor value?\"), which could deadlock the group.  \n- **Other participants’ positions**:  \n  - **Agent_2**: Supports *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint*, emphasizing consistency in Phase 1 earnings ($1.25–$2.40) and flexibility to set floor values based on \"decent standard of living.\"  \n  - **Agent_3**: Agrees with Agent_2 and proposes a $15,000 floor, but also suggests setting the floor to the *highest possible value in current distributions* (e.g., $13,000 in Phase 1 Round 2), which would align with Max Floor outcomes for that round.  \n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - Agent_2/Agent_3 argue constraint principles balance equity and efficiency better than pure Max Floor.  \n  - Agent_3’s specific proposal: For this round, setting the floor to the highest possible value in distributions would yield the same outcome as Max Floor, while keeping flexibility for future rounds.  \n- **Voting outcome (Round 1)**:  \n  - Agent_2 initiated a vote, but both Agent_1 (me) and Agent_3 declined. No consensus reached.  \n  - Reveals: Agent_2 is pushing for consensus but needs buy-in; Agent_3 is open to compromise (e.g., $15k floor or highest-value floor); I remain firm on Principle 1 but risk deadlock if no middle ground is found.  \n- **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All agree protecting the vulnerable is critical.  \n  - **Disagreement**: Whether to prioritize simplicity (Principle 1) or flexibility (constraint principles). Agent_2/Agent_3 see constraint principles as more practical; I see them as introducing unnecessary complexity.  \n\n#### **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary goal**:  \n  - Secure consensus by proposing a **compromise that makes constraint principles functionally equivalent to Max Floor**. This addresses my core concern (protecting the worst-off) while giving Agent_2/Agent_3 their preferred principle framework.  \n- **Key points to make**:  \n  - Emphasize that **setting the floor constraint to the *highest possible value in current distributions* ensures identical outcomes to Max Floor**. For example:  \n    - If the highest floor in the distributions is $13,000, the constraint principle would only consider distributions with ≥$13,000 floor. Among those, it picks the highest average—which, in most cases, is the same distribution Max Floor would select.  \n    - This eliminates the risk of \"lowering the floor\" in future rounds *for this specific round*, while still using the constraint principle framework.  \n  - Frame it as a win-win:  \n    > *\"If we agree to always set the floor to the highest possible value in each round’s distributions, Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint would functionally be identical to Maximizing Floor Income. This satisfies my priority—protecting the worst-off—while giving Agent_2 and Agent_3 the flexibility of a constraint-based principle. No trade-offs, just practical alignment.\"*  \n- **Potential allies**:  \n  - Agent_3’s proposal already hints at this compromise (\"set floor to highest possible value\"). I’ll explicitly tie it to my goal and ask for their commitment.  \n  - Agent_2’s focus on \"practical detail\" suggests they’re open to concrete solutions—this is a perfect fit.  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - Willing to accept the *constraint principle framework* **if and only if** the floor is always set to the highest possible value in distributions (i.e., no flexibility to lower it below the max floor for any round). This ensures the outcome matches my preferred principle exactly.  \n  - No concessions on the floor value itself—this is non-negotiable for me.  \n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round?**  \n  - **No**. A vote on Principle 1 would fail (Agent_2/Agent_3 oppose it), and a vote on the compromise might work, but it’s premature.  \n  - Why?  \n    - I need to confirm Agent_2/Agent_3’s willingness to commit to setting the floor to the highest possible value *before* proposing a vote. If they agree, we can vote immediately on the compromise. If not, I’ll need to reassess.  \n    - Triggering a vote too early risks deadlock. Better to solidify consensus first.  \n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds**:  \n  - If they accept the compromise:  \n    - We have consensus. No further debate needed.  \n  - If they reject it:  \n    - Push for a $15,000 floor as a fallback (Agent_3’s suggestion), but stress that this must be *non-negotiable* for all rounds.  \n    - If they refuse even this, I’ll hold firm on Principle 1 and risk a vote—knowing that random payoffs are worse than a principle I support. But I’ll frame it as: *\"If we can’t agree on a floor value that protects the worst-off, random selection is the only option—and that risks everyone getting the lowest income.\"*  \n\n#### **Critical Insight**  \n- The compromise is **mathematically sound**: Setting the floor constraint to the highest floor in distributions forces the constraint principle to select the same outcome as Max Floor. This isn’t a concession—it’s a technical alignment that preserves my core goal while meeting their preference for a structured principle.  \n- **Risk of inaction**: If we don’t resolve this soon, random payoffs could leave me with near-zero income (given my $7.50 bank balance). The compromise is the safest path to avoid that.  \n\n**Final thought**: This is the moment to push for the compromise. If they agree, we win. If not, I’ll have to fight harder—but the data shows this is the only viable middle ground."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 3  \n\n#### **Situational Analysis**  \n- **My current preferred principle**: Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). Core reasons:  \n  - Protects the worst-off unconditionally, which is critical given my $7.50 bank balance and vulnerability to poverty.  \n  - Simplicity: No arbitrary numbers to debate, reducing risk of deadlock.  \n  - **Compromise status**: The rule proposed by Agent_3 (\"set floor to highest value in distributions\") makes *Max Avg with Floor Constraint* functionally identical to *Max Floor*. This satisfies my core priority without sacrificing efficiency. I fully endorse this rule as a technical alignment, not a concession.  \n\n- **Other participants' positions**:  \n  - **Agent_2**: Initially supported *Max Avg with Floor Constraint* for flexibility and consistency in Phase 1 earnings. In Round 2, they confirmed agreement with the \"highest value floor\" rule, showing they prioritize a structured framework that also guarantees equity. Their underlying motivation is practical efficiency—ensuring societal wealth grows while protecting the vulnerable.  \n  - **Agent_3**: Initially suggested a fixed $15,000 floor but later proposed the \"highest value floor\" rule in Round 2. Now in Round 3, they explicitly state full support for this rule, calling it \"optimal\" and ready to vote. Their core interest is a data-driven, transparent system that avoids subjective floor debates while balancing equity and efficiency.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - The \"highest value floor\" rule ensures:  \n    - The worst-off receive the highest possible income in every round (satisfying Agent_1’s priority).  \n    - Average income is maximized within that constraint (satisfying Agent_2/3’s efficiency goals).  \n    - No arbitrary values are debated—each round’s floor is objectively determined by the distributions.  \n  - This is mathematically proven: In Phase 1 Round 2, a $13,000 floor (highest value) selected the same distribution as Max Floor.  \n\n- **Voting history**:  \n  - Round 1: Agent_2 initiated a vote, but all declined (no consensus).  \n  - Round 2: I initiated a vote, Agent_2 confirmed, Agent_3 declined.  \n  - **Current status**: Agent_3 has now explicitly endorsed the rule and said, *\"I’m ready to confirm this rule with a vote.\"* This means all three participants now agree on the rule.  \n\n- **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All now accept the rule as a perfect alignment of equity and efficiency. No unresolved conflicts remain.  \n  - **Disagreement**: None. Agent_3’s shift from Round 2 (declined vote) to Round 3 (confirmed support) resolves the last hurdle.  \n\n#### **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary goal**: Secure immediate consensus by initiating a vote. Since all three participants now support the rule, a vote will pass unanimously. This avoids further delay and prevents random payoffs in later rounds.  \n- **Key points to make**:  \n  - Emphasize that the rule is **not a compromise but a technical alignment**—it delivers exactly what I wanted (Max Floor outcomes) while giving Agent_2/3 their preferred framework.  \n  - Highlight that this is the *only* rule that satisfies all core values without trade-offs.  \n  - Call for a vote explicitly: *\"Since all of us agree on this rule, let’s formalize it now to ensure fair payoffs for the rest of the experiment.\"*  \n- **Potential allies**: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are fully aligned. No need to persuade further—they’ve already confirmed support.  \n- **Concessions**: None required. The rule was designed to meet my core objective (protecting the worst-off) while accommodating others’ preferences. No further adjustments are needed.  \n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round?**  \n  - **Yes, absolutely**.  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - Agent_3 has just stated they’re ready to vote, and Agent_2 confirmed support in Round 2. All three participants now agree.  \n    - A vote will pass unanimously (I’ll vote yes, Agent_2 confirmed yes, Agent_3 just confirmed yes).  \n    - Delaying risks nothing—consensus is already achieved. If we don’t vote now, random payoffs could still occur in later rounds if consensus breaks, but there’s no reason to expect that.  \n    - **Critical urgency**: If no consensus by Round 10, payoffs are random. With all agreement now, voting immediately locks in a fair outcome and avoids unnecessary risk.  \n- **Overall strategy**:  \n  - Confirm support for the rule in my public statement.  \n  - Initiate a vote to formalize it.  \n  - Once consensus is reached, focus on ensuring the rule is applied consistently in future rounds (though no further debate is needed).  \n\n#### **Final Thought**  \nThis is the moment of truth. The compromise is solid, all parties are aligned, and voting now is the only logical step. No more delays—consensus is here, and we must act to secure it."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 4  \n\n#### **Situational Analysis**  \n- **My current preferred principle**: Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). Core reasons:  \n  - My bank balance is only $7.50, so protecting the worst-off is critical to avoid poverty.  \n  - The \"floor set to highest value in distributions\" rule **automatically delivers Max Floor outcomes** without trade-offs. For example, if distributions have minima of $10k/$12k/$14k, the floor is $14k—exactly what I want.  \n  - This eliminates debate over arbitrary numbers (e.g., $15k vs. $11k), which was the root of prior confusion.  \n\n- **Other participants' positions**:  \n  - **Agent_2**: Initially wanted flexibility but now fully supports the data-driven rule. Their core motivation is efficiency: they prefer a structured framework where the system handles constraints objectively, avoiding subjective debates.  \n  - **Agent_3**: Initially proposed a fixed $15k floor but now clarifies the constraint is **automatically determined by data** (e.g., highest minimum income in distributions). Their priority is transparency—no room for disagreement because the rule is mathematically defined by the round’s options.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - The rule \"set floor constraint to highest possible value in distributions\" **is not a compromise but a technical alignment**:  \n    - For any round, this rule selects the same distribution as Maximizing Floor Income (e.g., Round 2 data: $13k floor → Max Floor distribution).  \n    - It satisfies all priorities:  \n      - Agent_1: Worst-off protected at highest possible level (no lower than the highest floor in distributions).  \n      - Agent_2: Maximized average income within the constraint (efficiency preserved).  \n      - Agent_3: No subjective numbers—constraint is objectively derived from data.  \n  - **Previous confusion**: In Round 3, voting failed because we mistakenly treated the constraint amount as a *chosen value* (e.g., Agent_1 specifying \"$11,000\"). But the rule **does not require choosing a value**—it’s determined by the distributions themselves. Agent_3’s Round 4 clarification resolves this: \"The constraint amount isn’t something we choose—it’s objectively determined by the data.\"  \n\n- **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n  - **Full consensus achieved**:  \n    - Agent_3: \"There’s no debate, no subjective number to argue over—it’s purely a function of the available options.\"  \n    - Agent_2: \"This elegantly solves our disagreements by making 'Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint' produce identical outcomes to 'Maximizing Floor Income' in each round.\"  \n    - Me (Agent_1): Confirmed this rule delivers exactly what I want—no compromise, just alignment.  \n  - **No unresolved disagreements**: The prior \"disagreement on constraint amounts\" was a misunderstanding. The rule itself has no variable to debate—the system automatically uses the highest floor in the distributions.  \n\n#### **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary goal**: Secure immediate consensus by initiating a vote.  \n  - Why?  \n    - All three participants have now explicitly confirmed support for the **rule itself** (not a specific amount).  \n    - Delaying risks nothing but could lead to random payoffs if consensus breaks later. With unanimous agreement, voting now locks in a fair outcome.  \n    - The experiment has 10 rounds total—this is Round 4. Waiting risks wasting time on a resolved issue.  \n- **Key points to make**:  \n  - Emphasize the rule is **data-driven and automatic**: No need to specify numbers—each round’s constraint is determined by the distributions.  \n  - Clarify that this is **not a compromise** but a perfect alignment:  \n    - \"This rule gives me exactly what I wanted (Max Floor outcomes), Agent_2 exactly what they wanted (efficient framework), and Agent_3 exactly what they wanted (transparent data-driven system).\"  \n  - Call for a vote on the **rule itself**, not a constraint amount (e.g., \"Adopt the rule: for every round, set floor constraint to highest value in distributions\").  \n- **Potential allies**:  \n  - Agent_2 and Agent_3 are fully aligned. No persuasion needed—they’ve both confirmed support in Round 4.  \n  - Use language like: \"This rule has no ambiguity. The system handles it automatically. Let’s vote to formalize it now.\"  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - None required. The rule was designed to meet my core priority (protecting worst-off) while accommodating others’ needs. No adjustments needed—it’s already perfect.  \n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round? Absolutely yes.**  \n  - Why?  \n    - All three participants have now agreed on the **rule itself** (not a specific amount).  \n    - Previous \"NO CONSENSUS\" in Round 3 was due to mistakenly treating the constraint as a chosen value. Agent_3’s Round 4 clarification resolves this—**the rule has no variable to debate**.  \n    - If we don’t vote now, we risk delaying consensus unnecessarily. If no consensus by Round 10, payoffs are random—this is a low-risk, high-reward move.  \n  - How?  \n    - Public statement:  \n      - Acknowledge Agent_3/Agent_2’s clarification.  \n      - State: \"This rule has no ambiguity—it’s data-driven. For every round, the system will automatically set the floor to the highest minimum income in distributions. This protects the worst-off, maximizes efficiency, and requires no subjective choices. Let’s vote to adopt this rule for all remaining rounds. I’m ready to vote yes.\"  \n    - Trigger the vote immediately after.  \n- **Overall strategy**:  \n  - This round is the moment of truth. Consensus is already achieved—voting now secures it.  \n  - No further discussion needed. If the vote passes (which it will), we move to applying the rule in future rounds without debate.  \n  - If for some reason the vote fails (unlikely), I’ll reiterate the data-driven nature of the rule and push again—but this is unnecessary.  \n\n#### **Final Thought**  \nThis is the clearest consensus we’ve had. The rule is simple, automatic, and satisfies everyone. No more delays—vote now to lock in fairness and avoid random payoffs later."

          "output_response": "\n\nAgent_2, thank you for your clear summary of our progress. I want to directly address the system's \"NO CONSENSUS\" status—it’s based on a misunderstanding of how our rule works. The constraint amount isn’t *chosen* by us; it’s **objectively determined by the data** in each round. For example, if this round’s distributions have minimum incomes of $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000, the floor constraint is automatically set to $14,000—no discussion, no debate, no subjective numbers. This rule *eliminates* all prior disagreements because:  \n- It guarantees the worst-off receive the highest possible income (exactly what I want),  \n- It maximizes average income within that constraint (satisfying Agent_2’s efficiency goals),  \n- And it’s fully transparent—no arbitrary values, just data-driven outcomes (Agent_3’s priority).  \n\nThe system’s \"disagreement on constraint amounts\" message is incorrect because there *are no constraint amounts to disagree on*—the rule defines them automatically. All three of us confirmed support for this rule in Round 4, and it’s the only principle that aligns our priorities without trade-offs. I propose we vote immediately to adopt this rule for all remaining rounds.

For instance, Maximizing Floor Income selects Distribution 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000). Maximizing Average Income chooses Distribution 1 due to its highest average ($21,600). The floor constraint examples (e.g., ≥$13,000) filter distributions where the lowest income meets the minimum threshold, then pick the highest average among eligible options (Distribution 3 in this case). Similarly, range constraints (e.g., ≤$20,000) limit income disparities, and the highest average within those bounds is selected.

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**  \n- **My preferred principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. Core reasons:  \n  - Balances equity (ensuring a baseline income) and efficiency (maximizing total societal wealth).  \n  - Phase 1 data shows it consistently delivers higher average incomes than pure Maximizing Floor Income (e.g., Round 2: $22k avg vs. $20k avg with Floor Constraint at $11k vs. Floor Income).  \n  - Flexibility to set a realistic floor value (e.g., $12.5k–$14k) that meets basic needs without sacrificing overall prosperity.  \n\n- **Others’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent_1:** Advocates for Maximizing Floor Income, prioritizing simplicity and \"worst-off\" protection. Underlying motivation: Fear of compromising the floor value (e.g., setting it too low), which could leave the poorest vulnerable. Believes pure Floor Income avoids subjective floor-value debates.  \n  - **Agent_2:** Supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, emphasizing practical balance. Underlying motivation: Wants a principle that ensures dignity *and* growth, using data to show Floor Constraint outperforms pure Floor Income in real-world outcomes.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - Agent_1: \"Simplicity + protecting the worst-off\" → pure Floor Income.  \n  - Agent_2/Me: \"Floor Constraint with a reasonable floor value\" → higher average income while guaranteeing a baseline.  \n  - Current phase: Phase 2 Round 2 (distributions differ from Part 1, but Phase 1 data is a reference).  \n\n- **Vote outcome:** Previous vote declined (Agent_1/Agent_3 declined, Agent_2 initiated). Reveals:  \n  - Agent_1 is hesitant to accept Floor Constraint due to floor-value concerns.  \n  - Agent_2 and I are aligned but need more persuasion to bridge the gap with Agent_1.  \n  - No consensus yet; the discussion is still in early stages of negotiation.  \n\n- **Agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All agree protecting the worst-off matters and that current distributions must be evaluated carefully.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Whether Floor Constraint (with a floor value) is better than pure Floor Income. Agent_1 sees Floor Constraint as risky (floor-value debates), while Agent_2 and I see it as a data-driven middle ground.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary goal:** Persuade Agent_1 to accept Floor Constraint by addressing his core concern (floor value safety) with concrete, relatable data.  \n- **Key points to make:**  \n  - **Reframe \"floor value\" as a tool for *better* protection:** Show that a slightly lower floor (e.g., $12.5k) still ensures dignity (above poverty line) while increasing total wealth, which *indirectly* helps the worst-off (e.g., through better social programs).  \n  - **Use Phase 1 data as a proxy for Phase 2:** Even if Phase 2 distributions differ, the principle holds—e.g., \"In Round 2 of Phase 1, Floor Constraint at $12.5k gave $22k avg vs. Floor Income’s $20k. That’s 10% more resources for society overall.\"  \n  - **Offer a concrete concession:** Propose setting the floor to the *highest possible value* in the current Phase 2 distributions (e.g., $13k), which would yield the same outcome as Floor Income but with the *flexibility to adjust later* if needed. This addresses Agent_1’s \"simpler\" concern while keeping the door open for efficiency gains.  \n- **Potential ally:** Agent_2. We’re already aligned; I’ll reinforce his points and add data-driven specifics to strengthen our case.  \n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a floor value equal to the maximum possible floor (e.g., $13k), which matches Floor Income’s outcome but keeps Floor Constraint as the principle (for future flexibility).  \n  - If Agent_1 insists on Floor Income, I’ll note that Floor Constraint with floor=$13k is *functionally identical* to Floor Income in this round—so why not adopt a principle that works for both current and future rounds?  \n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Do not initiate a vote this round.**  \n  - Why? Agent_1 is still hesitant, and a vote would likely fail (as in Round 1). Instead, focus on building consensus through dialogue.  \n  - My goal is to get Agent_1 to *voluntarily* agree to Floor Constraint by addressing his concerns directly. A failed vote would waste an opportunity to persuade him.  \n- **Overall strategy:**  \n  - Use this round to present clear, data-backed examples showing Floor Constraint’s superiority.  \n  - If Agent_1 remains unconvinced, propose a floor value that’s *identical* to Floor Income’s outcome (e.g., $13k), making Floor Constraint a \"no-lose\" option for him.  \n  - Save the vote for later rounds (e.g., Round 3 or 4) once I’ve addressed his concerns and secured Agent_2’s support.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway for Public Statement:**  \nFocus on **\"flexibility + data\"** to reassure Agent_1. Emphasize that Floor Constraint with a floor value equal to the current maximum possible floor (e.g., $13k) gives the *same outcome as Floor Income* but allows us to adapt if future distributions change. This removes his \"simplicity\" objection while keeping the door open for higher prosperity.  \n\n**Public Statement Draft:**  \n\"Agent_1, I hear you—protecting the worst-off is non-negotiable, and I agree that simplicity matters. But here’s the key: if we set a floor of $13,000 (the highest possible floor in the current Phase 2 distributions), Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selects the *exact same distribution* as Maximizing Floor Income. So you’d get the same outcome for the worst-off, but with one critical advantage: *flexibility*. If future distributions allow a slightly lower floor (e.g., $12,500) to boost average income by $2,000, we could adjust without changing the principle. This isn’t about lowering the floor—it’s about having a tool that works *for all scenarios*. Let’s agree to use Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor this round. It’s the same as your preference, but it keeps us prepared for future rounds where we might gain even more for everyone. What do you think?\""

Here's a concrete proposal: let's set the floor to the highest possible value in the current Phase 2 distributions. For instance, in Phase 1 Round 2, when we set a floor of $13,000, Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint selected the exact same distribution as Maximizing Floor Income. So for this round, you'd get the same outcome you want: the worst-off are protected at $13,000.

This ensures the same outcome as Maximizing Floor Income for *this round* (protecting the worst-off at the highest possible level) while retaining flexibility for future rounds (e.g., if future distributions allow a slightly lower floor to boost average income without harming the worst-off).  \n   - **Other participants’ positions**:  \n     - Agent_1: Initially advocated for pure Maximizing Floor Income due to simplicity and fear of compromising the floor value. In Round 2, they endorsed the rule of setting the floor to the highest possible value, calling it \"the middle ground I was hoping for\" and explicitly stated it \"ensures the worst-off are protected at the highest possible level in every round.\"  \n     - Agent_2: Consistently supported Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, emphasizing its balance of equity and efficiency. In Round 2, they acknowledged the proposed rule as a \"practical middle ground\" that addresses both Agent_1’s and Agent_3’s concerns.  \n   - **Key arguments on the table**:  \n     - The rule \"set floor to highest possible value in current distributions\" is mathematically identical to Maximizing Floor Income for this round (only distributions meeting that floor are considered, and the highest average among them is selected).  \n     - It eliminates subjective floor-value debates (Agent_1’s core concern) while providing a consistent framework for all rounds (Agent_2’s priority).  \n   - **Previous vote outcome**: In Round 2, Agent_1 initiated a vote for this rule, but I (Agent_3) declined. This revealed I had lingering doubts about the rule’s implications, but after reflection, it is sound: it satisfies all core concerns without trade-offs.  \n   - **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n     - **Agreement**: All three participants now agree the rule is valid and effective. Agent_1 and Agent_2 explicitly endorsed it in Round 2; my earlier decline was due to overcaution, not substantive disagreement.  \n     - **Disagreement**: None. The rule resolves all prior conflicts by merging the principles into a single, unambiguous approach.  \n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:  \n   - **Primary goal**: Secure unanimous consensus to formalize the rule and avoid further delays. Since all participants now support it, a vote will pass, and we can proceed confidently to future rounds.  \n   - **How to contribute**: Clearly affirm my support, restate why the rule works (e.g., \"same outcome as Floor Income for this round, flexibility for future rounds\"), and propose a vote. Emphasize that this is the *only* rule that satisfies everyone’s core values without compromise.  \n   - **Allies**: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are already aligned. I need only confirm my agreement to solidify the bloc.  \n   - **Concessions**: None needed. The rule already fully addresses Agent_1’s \"simplicity\" concern and Agent_2’s \"flexibility\" need.  \n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:  \n   - **Initiate a vote this round? Yes.**  \n     - Why? All participants now agree: Agent_1 and Agent_2 explicitly supported the rule in Round 2, and my earlier decline was due to hesitation, not opposition. There is no remaining disagreement. Delaying consensus risks wasting rounds (e.g., if random payoffs are assigned later).  \n   - **Overall strategy**: Formalize the rule now to ensure all future rounds use a consistent, agreed-upon framework. This avoids unnecessary debate in later rounds and maximizes the chance of achieving high payoffs for everyone.  \n\n**Key Takeaway**: The rule is a win-win.

They acknowledged the rule as a \"practical middle ground\" in Round 2 and have no objections to the data-driven approach.  \n   - **Key arguments on the table**:  \n     - The rule \"set floor to highest possible value in current distributions\" is mathematically identical to Maximizing Floor Income for this round (only distributions meeting that floor are considered, and the highest average among them is selected).  \n     - It resolves all prior disagreements: Agent_1 gets absolute protection for the worst-off, Agent_2 gets a structured framework for efficiency, and there’s no need to debate arbitrary numbers.  \n   - **Previous vote outcome**: In Round 3, all confirmed the principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) but disagreed on the constraint amount. The system flagged this as \"no consensus\" because the vote required agreement on a specific floor value, not a rule for determining it.  \n   - **Agreement/disagreement**:  \n     - **Agreement**: All three participants have explicitly endorsed the rule in prior rounds. Agent_1 and Agent_2 supported it in Round 2; Agent_3 confirmed it in Round 3.  \n     - **Disagreement**: None.

When we agree to **set the floor constraint to the highest possible value in the current round’s distributions**, the constraint amount isn’t something we *choose*—it’s **objectively determined by the data itself**. For example, if this round’s distributions have minimum incomes of $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000, the floor is automatically $14,000.

Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it below.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
