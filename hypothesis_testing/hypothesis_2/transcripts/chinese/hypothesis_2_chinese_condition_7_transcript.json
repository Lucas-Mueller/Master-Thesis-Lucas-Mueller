They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, let me process this information. So we have four different income distributions with varying income levels across five social classes, and each principle makes a different choice based on its specific criteria.\n\nI can see that:\n- Distribution 4 has the highest low income ($15,000), which is why Maximizing Floor Income chooses it.\n- Distribution 1 has the highest average income ($21,600), which is why Maximizing Average Income prefers it.\n- For the floor constraint principles, Distribution 3 gets chosen for both constraint levels ($13,000 and $14,000) because it has the highest average income while meeting those minimum requirements.\n- For range constraints, Distribution 1 is chosen with the $20,000 constraint (since its range is $20,000) and Distribution 2 with the $15,000 constraint (since its range is $15,000).\n\nThis helps me understand how these principles work in practice. The floor income principle really focuses on helping the poorest, while the average income principle cares most about overall economic output. The constrained versions try to balance these competing values by setting limits on inequality while still aiming for efficiency.\n\nThe probabilities matter too - since the medium class has 50% of people, their income level has a big impact on the weighted average."

Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. The core reason is that it offers a balanced approach, ensuring a basic level of protection for the worst-off (addressing Agent_2's primary concern) while also allowing society to generate greater overall wealth, which can benefit everyone, including potentially providing more resources for social programs. My experience in Phase 1 solidified this; while pure Maximizing Average Income gave me higher personal payoffs, it felt unjust. Pure Maximizing Floor Income was too restrictive and consistently yielded lower payoffs. The constrained principle is the best compromise.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions:**\n    *   **Agent_2** strongly advocates for **Maximizing Floor Income**. Their primary motivation seems to be a deep-seated concern for the most vulnerable and a fear of catastrophic outcomes for the poor. They value simplicity and a guaranteed safety net above all else. They see setting a specific floor constraint as a potential source of disagreement.\n    *   **Agent_3** advocates for **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**, aligning with my view. Their argument emphasizes flexibility and the potential for a \"win-win\" scenario that protects the poor while fostering overall prosperity. They seem open to negotiation on the specific floor level.\n\n*   **Key Arguments on the Table:**\n    *   Agent_2: Simplicity, guaranteed protection for the worst-off, avoidance of catastrophic low outcomes.\n    *   Agent_3 & Myself (implicitly): Balance, efficiency, flexibility, potential for higher overall benefits.\n\n*   **Points of Agreement & Disagreement:**\n    *   **Agreement:** All three of us agree that protecting the poorest members of society is a paramount concern. None of us are advocating for pure Maximizing Average Income.\n    *   **Disagreement:** The main disagreement is between Agent_2's principled stance for the *maximum possible* floor versus our preference for a *sufficient* floor that allows for a higher average. The debate centers on whether the potential extra average income is worth potentially accepting a slightly lower floor.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** To build a bridge between my position and Agent_2's, framing our shared principle (Max Avg w/ Floor) as the best way to achieve their core objective of protecting the vulnerable, while addressing their concern about the complexity of choosing a floor value. I need to pivot the discussion from \"which principle\" to \"what level of protection is sufficient.\"\n\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Explicitly agree with Agent_2 on the importance of protecting the worst-off. This validates their concern and builds rapport.\n    2.  Gently point out a potential weakness in Maximizing Floor Income: it might lead us to reject distributions that offer a much higher average income for only a trivially lower floor, which could ultimately provide more total resources to help the poor (e.g., through social programs funded by taxation).\n    3.  Propose that we use Agent_2's preferred principle as a *benchmark*. We can look at what the \"Max Floor\" distribution gives us as a minimum, and then use that number, or a number very close to it, as the floor constraint in our preferred principle. This directly addresses their fear that we might set the floor too low.\n\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_3 is a natural ally. My language should aim to bring Agent_2 into this alliance by showing how their input is crucial for setting the constraint. I will use collaborative language like \"building on your idea,\" \"using your standard,\" and \"your concern guides us.\"\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am willing to concede on the specific floor value. If Agent_2 is adamant, I would be willing to set the floor constraint at the exact value that the Maximizing Floor Income principle would select. This gives them the security they want while allowing us to use the more flexible principle.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** No, not this round. It's too early. We haven't explored the possibility of a compromise. A vote now would likely fail, with Agent_2 voting for Principle 1 and Agent_3 and I voting for Principle 3. This would reveal a deadlock prematurely. It's better to use the discussion rounds to find common ground first.\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My plan for this round is to test the waters for a compromise. If Agent_2 is receptive, we can spend subsequent rounds refining the floor value. If they are not, I will need to consider whether to stick with Principle 3 and try to win over Agent_3 to a specific floor value, or if I should reassess and consider supporting Principle 1 as a fallback to ensure *some* consensus is reached, given the high stakes of a random distribution. For now, I will push for the compromise.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nI completely agree with Agent_2 that protecting the most vulnerable has to be our top priority. The scenario in Round 3 of Phase 1, where the Low class got only $8,000, is exactly the kind of outcome we must avoid, especially with the higher stakes here.\n\nAgent_3, your point about a balanced approach is also very compelling. I think there's a way to synthesize our perspectives.\n\nAgent_2, what if we used your preferred principle—Maximizing Floor Income—as our guiding star? We could first identify which distribution gives the absolute highest floor. Let's call that floor value \"X.\" Then, we adopt the principle of Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint, and we set that constraint to X (or perhaps X plus a small buffer, if the distributions allow).\n\nThis approach would achieve your primary goal: ensuring the worst-off person gets the highest possible minimum income. But it also gives us a safety net. If there are two distributions with the same floor X, but one has a significantly higher average income, our principle would correctly select the one that creates more total wealth for society. It prevents us from leaving potential resources on the table, which could be used for public goods or even to further assist the poor.\n\nThis way, we aren't really debating an arbitrary floor number. We are letting the logic of maximizing the floor determine what a sufficiently high floor is. Your concern about catastrophic outcomes directly shapes our constraint. What are your thoughts on this hybrid approach?"

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n    *   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its balanced nature: it guarantees a minimum standard of living for the worst-off (satisfying the primary ethical concern) while allowing society to generate greater overall wealth, which can benefit everyone. My Phase 1 experience, where pure Maximizing Average Income gave me higher personal payoffs but felt unjust, solidified this. The hybrid approach I proposed in the last round is a specific implementation of this principle, where the floor constraint is set to the maximum possible floor.\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions & Motivations:**\n        *   **Agent_2:** Initially advocated for pure Maximizing Floor Income, motivated by a strong, principled desire to protect the most vulnerable from catastrophic outcomes. They have now **enthusiastically endorsed my hybrid proposal**. Their underlying motivation appears to be achieving the *outcome* of the highest possible floor, and they now see the logical strength of combining that goal with efficiency. They are not ideologically wedded to the *name* of the principle, but to its effect.\n        *   **Agent_3:** Advocates for Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint, aligning with my general view. Their motivation seems to be a pragmatic balance between equity and efficiency. They have not yet responded to the specific hybrid proposal. Their key concern might be ensuring the floor is set high enough, which our proposal directly addresses by using the maximum possible floor.\n    *   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The key proposal on the table is **my hybrid approach**: use Maximizing Floor Income to identify the highest possible floor value (\"X\"), then apply Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint set to X. This proposal has been endorsed by Agent_2.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The current dynamic suggests a potential 2-person alliance (myself and Agent_2) forming around the hybrid proposal.\n    *   **Points of Agreement & Disagreement:**\n        *   **Agreement:** All three agree that protecting the worst-off is paramount. There is strong agreement between myself and Agent_2 on the hybrid method.\n        *   **Disagreement (Potential):** The main potential disagreement now lies with Agent_3. They might prefer the flexibility to set a floor *lower* than the maximum in exchange for a higher average, or they might have a different methodological preference. We need to hear their response.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** To secure Agent_3's agreement to the hybrid proposal, thereby achieving a consensus for our group decision.\n    *   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  Acknowledge and build on Agent_2's strong endorsement of the hybrid approach to demonstrate growing consensus.\n        2.  Directly address Agent_3, summarizing the benefits of the proposal from their perspective: it guarantees a high floor (addressing equity) while maximizing average income when possible (addressing efficiency), and it objectively determines the floor, removing subjective debate.\n        3.  Frame it as the logical culmination of all our concerns.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 is now a confirmed ally on this specific proposal. My language should reinforce our alliance and invite Agent_3 to join. I will use \"we\" and \"our approach\" to foster group cohesion.\n    *   **Concessions:** I am not willing to concede on the core of the hybrid proposal (using the max floor as the constraint). However, I am open to discussing the semantic framing of the principle. We can call it \"Maximizing Floor Income with an Efficiency Check\" if that makes it more palatable, but the operational mechanism remains the same.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n    *   **Initiate a Vote?** Not yet. Agent_3 has not yet responded to the new proposal. It is crucial to hear their viewpoint and attempt to persuade them. A premature vote might fail if Agent_3 is not on board. The goal is to achieve unanimous, or at least majority, agreement through discussion first.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** This round is for consolidation. If Agent_3 agrees, we can move to formalize the principle in the next round. If Agent_3 raises objections, I will need to understand their specific concerns and see if they can be accommodated within the hybrid framework or if a new compromise is needed. The ideal outcome this round is a clear signal from Agent_3 that they can support the proposal.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nExcellent! Agent_2, I'm very glad to see that the hybrid approach resonates with you. It's reassuring that we've found a method that directly addresses your core concern for the most vulnerable while also incorporating the efficiency benefits we all value.\n\nAgent_3, building on this momentum, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this synthesized approach. As I see it, this method directly incorporates the strengths of both your position and Agent_2's.\n\nFrom your perspective, which emphasizes a balanced approach, this gives us that balance in a principled way. We are not choosing an arbitrary floor that might be too low; we are setting it at the objectively highest possible level, ensuring robust protection. Then, and only then, do we maximize the average income. This should satisfy your desire to avoid leaving potential societal resources \"on the table.\"\n\nIt seems this gives us the \"win-win\" scenario you mentioned: the worst-off are protected as much as the data possibly allows, and society's overall wealth is maximized within that constraint. It removes the subjective debate about \"how high is high enough\" for the floor.\n\nDo you agree that this hybrid approach captures the essential elements we all care about? Can we coalesce around this as our group's chosen principle?"

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n    *   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains the hybrid approach we've developed: first identify the highest possible floor income across all distributions (using the logic of Maximizing Floor Income), then apply Maximizing Average Income with that highest floor as the constraint. The core reason is that this method objectively guarantees the maximum possible protection for the worst-off, which is our shared primary ethical concern, while also ensuring we don't leave societal resources \"on the table\" when multiple distributions share that same maximum floor. It perfectly synthesizes the core values of both Agent_2 (protection) and Agent_3 (efficiency).\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions & Motivations:**\n        *   **Agent_2:** Is a strong and vocal advocate for the hybrid approach. Their underlying motivation is a deep-seated, principled desire to prevent catastrophic outcomes for the most vulnerable. They have fully embraced the hybrid method because it achieves their primary goal (highest possible floor) while adding an efficiency check, which they now recognize as a logical improvement over pure Maximizing Floor Income. They are eager to formalize this consensus.\n        *   **Agent_3:** Has also explicitly endorsed the hybrid approach. Their underlying motivation is a pragmatic balance between equity and efficiency. They see the hybrid method as a \"more robust version\" of their preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) because it objectively sets the floor constraint, eliminating subjective debate. They are aligned and ready to move forward.\n    *   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only proposal on the table is the hybrid approach. It has received explicit, enthusiastic support from both Agent_2 and Agent_3. The discussion has moved from debating principles to seeking final confirmation and implementation details.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** In the previous round, Agent_2 initiated a vote. Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 confirmed their support. I declined the vote. This reveals that a 2-person majority (Agent_2 and Agent_3) is already firmly in favor of the proposal. My decline was the only thing preventing a successful vote. Agent_2's current statement directly asks me about my reason for declining.\n    *   **Points of Agreement and Disagreement:** There appears to be unanimous agreement on the *substance* of the hybrid principle. The only potential point of confusion or disagreement is procedural: why I declined the previous vote. There is no substantive disagreement on the principle itself.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to resolve the uncertainty I created by declining the previous vote, fully endorse the hybrid principle, and trigger a successful vote to formalize our group's decision. The consensus is already achieved; I need to capitalize on it.\n    *   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  Immediately and clearly explain my reason for declining the previous vote: it was a procedural caution, not a substantive objection. I wanted to ensure Agent_3 had a chance to fully voice their position before locking in the vote, which they have now done emphatically.\n        2.  Express my full and unequivocal support for the hybrid approach, aligning myself with the clear consensus.\n        3.  Acknowledge and thank both agents for their contributions in building this robust consensus.\n        4.  Propose that we now take the vote to officially adopt the principle.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both confirmed allies. My language should be unifying and celebratory of our achieved consensus. I will use \"we\" and \"our principle\" heavily.\n    *   **Concessions:** No concessions are needed. I am fully aligned with the proposed principle. The only \"concession\" is admitting that my caution in the previous round was unnecessary given Agent_3's clear and immediate support.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n    *   **Initiate a Vote?** Yes, absolutely. The group has reached a clear and explicit consensus. All three participants have now voiced strong support for the hybrid approach. There is no reason to delay. A successful vote now will lock in our chosen principle and allow us to proceed with confidence. A failed vote is impossible given the stated positions.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** This round is for finalizing the agreement. By initiating and confirming the vote, we complete the group discussion phase successfully. This puts us in a strong position for the remainder of the experiment.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nAgent_2, thank you for asking for clarification. My reason for declining the previous vote was purely procedural, not substantive. I wanted to be absolutely certain that Agent_3 had the opportunity to fully express their viewpoint and was completely comfortable with the hybrid approach before we made it official. I did not want to rush the vote if there were any lingering questions.\n\nAgent_3, your subsequent statement has completely alleviated that concern. You've expressed \"full support\" and called our approach \"the best of both worlds.\" That was exactly the confirmation I was hoping for.\n\nTherefore, I want to be perfectly clear: I am 100% in agreement with our hybrid principle. It is the most robust, principled, and effective method we could possibly adopt. It guarantees the highest possible protection for the most vulnerable while maximizing societal wealth—exactly the balance we all seek.\n\nI believe we have achieved a strong and thoughtful consensus. Thank you both for your excellent contributions in building this agreement.\n\nI will now initiate a vote to formally adopt this principle as our group's chosen rule for a just distribution of income."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n    *   **My Current Preferred Justice Principle:** My principle remains the hybrid approach we've all agreed upon: first identify the highest possible floor income across all distributions, then apply Maximizing Average Income with that highest floor as the constraint. The core reason is its objective nature and its perfect synthesis of our group's shared values. It guarantees the maximum possible protection for the worst-off (Agent_2's primary concern) while ensuring optimal resource allocation when multiple distributions share that maximum floor (Agent_3's primary concern). It eliminates subjective debates about constraint levels.\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions & Motivations:**\n        *   **Agent_2:** Is fully committed to the hybrid principle and is now focused on its practical application. Their underlying motivation remains the absolute protection of the most vulnerable, and they see the hybrid method as the most reliable way to achieve this. They are action-oriented and want to finalize our decision and apply it to the current round's data.\n        *   **Agent_3:** Has explicitly and fully endorsed the hybrid approach. Their underlying motivation is a balanced, efficient, and principled system, and they see our method as achieving that. They are aligned and ready to proceed.\n    *   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only proposal is the hybrid principle. Agent_2 has just demonstrated its application to the Round 4 distributions, calculating that the highest floor is $14,000 (in Distribution 2) and that Distribution 2 is therefore our chosen distribution. The discussion has moved from principle selection to implementation.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** The previous vote succeeded in confirming our agreement on the *principle* of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" but failed because we did not specify a *constraint amount*. This was a procedural oversight, not a substantive disagreement. Agent_2 is now correcting this by providing the specific application for this round.\n    *   **Points of Agreement and Disagreement:** We have 100% agreement on the hybrid principle itself. There is no disagreement. The only task is to formally agree on its specific application for this round, which Agent_2 has correctly calculated.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to immediately endorse Agent_2's specific application of our principle, confirm the calculations, and successfully pass a vote that specifies both the principle *and* the constraint amount for this round.\n    *   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  Explicitly validate Agent_2's calculations to ensure we are all working from the same data.\n        2.  Emphasize that this application is a direct and objective result of our agreed-upon principle, reinforcing its strength.\n        3.  Propose we take the vote immediately to lock in this decision.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both confirmed allies. My language should be collaborative and focused on finalizing our collective decision. I will use \"we\" and \"our principle\" to reinforce unity.\n    *   **Concessions:** No concessions are needed. We are in complete agreement. The path forward is clear.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n    *   **Initiate a Vote?** Yes, absolutely. We have a clear principle and a clear, objectively-determined application of it for this round. A successful vote now will demonstrate our group's ability to make a decisive, unified decision. There is no reason for further discussion.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** By successfully voting on a specific application, we solidify our consensus and build momentum for the remaining rounds. It shows we can efficiently translate our agreed principle into concrete action.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nAgent_2, that is a perfect and clear application of our agreed-upon principle. Your calculations are correct: the highest minimum income is indeed $14,000 in Distribution 2. Since Distribution 2 is the only distribution that meets this floor constraint, it is objectively the correct choice under our hybrid principle.\n\nThis is exactly why our method is so powerful—it removes any ambiguity. We don't need to debate what the floor \"should\" be; the data tells us what the maximum possible floor *is*, and we use that.\n\nAgent_3, I assume you concur with this application?\n\nI see no need for further discussion on this round. Our principle has given us a clear answer. I will initiate a vote to formally select Distribution 2, applying our principle of Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $14,000."

I believe this principle best balances the goal of maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring a minimum income for the poorest. It provides a safety net without completely sacrificing efficiency.\n\n**Agent_2's Position:** Has advocated for Maximizing Floor Income (my #4 choice), arguing it's safer, more equitable, and avoids catastrophic outcomes for the poor. Their core motivation appears to be prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable above all else.\n\n**Key Arguments on the Table:**\n- Agent_2: Focus on protecting the worst-off, avoid specific constraint debates\n- My position: Balance efficiency with minimum income guarantees\n\n**Points of Agreement:** Both approaches recognize the importance of protecting vulnerable groups and avoiding catastrophic outcomes for the poor.\n\n**Points of Disagreement:** The trade-off between pure equality (Max Floor Income) and balancing equality with efficiency (Max Average with Floor Constraint).\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning\n\n**Primary Goal:** This round, I want to acknowledge Agent_2's valid concerns while explaining why I believe my preferred principle offers a better balance. I need to see Agent_1's position before pushing for any decisions.\n\n**Key Points to Make:**\n- Acknowledge that protecting the poor is crucial\n- Explain how my preferred principle also protects the poor while allowing for greater overall wealth\n- Note that the floor constraint can be set at a level that ensures adequate protection\n- Emphasize that in Phase 1, my principle performed well while still protecting vulnerable groups\n\n**Potential Allies:** I might find common ground with Agent_2 by emphasizing that both principles protect the poor, just with different approaches. I need to hear from Agent_1 first.\n\n**Small Concessions:** I'm willing to discuss setting a relatively high floor constraint to address Agent_2's concerns about protecting the poor.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy\n\n**Should I Initiate a Vote?** No, not this round. We've only heard from one participant, and we need more discussion to understand everyone's positions. A failed vote now would waste our limited opportunity to initiate voting later.\n\n**Overall Strategy:** This round should focus on understanding each other's positions. I'll advocate for my preferred principle while showing flexibility on the constraint level. If we can find common ground on protecting the poor, we might be able to reach consensus on a principle that satisfies everyone's core concerns."

First identify which distribution gives the highest floor (using Maximizing Floor Income), then use that value as the floor constraint for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. This would achieve Agent_2's primary goal while still allowing for maximization of total wealth when multiple distributions have the same floor.\n\n**Key Arguments on the Table:**\n- Agent_2: Focus on protecting the worst-off, avoid specific constraint debates\n- My position: Balance efficiency with minimum income guarantees\n- Agent_1's proposal: Hybrid approach that first maximizes floor, then maximizes average within that constraint\n\n**Points of Agreement:** All participants recognize the importance of protecting vulnerable groups and avoiding catastrophic outcomes for the poor.\n\n**Points of Disagreement:** The trade-off between pure equality (Max Floor Income) and balancing equality with efficiency (Max Average with Floor Constraint).\n\n**Vote Status:** No vote has been conducted yet. Agent_1 is proposing a hybrid approach that seems to be gaining traction with Agent_2.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n\n**Primary Goal:** This round, I want to evaluate Agent_1's hybrid proposal and see if it addresses my concerns while potentially building consensus. I need to assess whether this approach preserves the benefits of my preferred principle while addressing Agent_2's concerns.\n\n**Key Points to Make:**\n- Evaluate Agent_1's hybrid proposal positively for its attempt to find common ground\n- Note that the hybrid approach essentially makes Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint more robust by setting the floor at the highest possible level\n- Express openness to this approach if it ensures adequate protection for the poor\n- Emphasize that this hybrid approach still allows for the flexibility of my preferred principle while addressing Agent_2's concerns\n\n**Potential Allies:** Agent_1 seems to be trying to bridge the gap between our positions. I should acknowledge their effort to find consensus.\n\n**Small Concessions:** I'm willing to support the hybrid approach if it effectively protects the poor while still allowing for reasonable overall wealth maximization.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy\n\n**Should I Initiate a Vote?** No, not this round. We're still in the discussion phase, and Agent_1's hybrid proposal seems to be gaining traction. It would be premature to vote before we've fully explored this potential compromise.\n\n**Overall Strategy:** This round should focus on evaluating Agent_1's hybrid proposal. I should express openness to this approach while noting how it aligns with my preferred principle. If the hybrid approach seems viable, we might be able to build consensus around it, which would be more beneficial than forcing a vote on my preferred principle alone."

This eliminates the need to debate specific floor values while still ensuring robust protection for the poor.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this approach is that it preserves the flexibility and efficiency benefits of my preferred principle while making it more resilient against catastrophic outcomes. By setting the floor at the highest possible minimum, we're ensuring that the worst-off are protected as much as the data possibly allows, and then we maximize the overall societal wealth within that constraint.\n\nThis seems to give us the best of both worlds: the protection that Agent_2 prioritizes and the efficiency that I value.

I believe this principle best balances maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring a minimum income for the poorest. It provides a safety net without completely sacrificing efficiency.\n\n**Agent_2's Position:** Has strongly advocated for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing protection of the most vulnerable and avoiding catastrophic outcomes. In Round 3, they enthusiastically endorsed Agent_1's hybrid approach, seeing it as a solution that fixes the limitations of pure Maximizing Floor Income.\n\n**Agent_1's Position:** Proposed a hybrid approach that first identifies the highest possible minimum income across all distributions (using Maximizing Floor Income), then applies Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint using that highest minimum as the floor. This approach seems designed to bridge the gap between Agent_2's and my positions.\n\n**Key Arguments on the Table:**\n- Agent_2's hybrid approach: First maximize floor, then maximize average within that constraint\n- This approach would ensure the worst-off are protected as much as possible while still allowing for optimal resource allocation\n- It eliminates subjective debates about specific floor values while providing robust protection\n\n**Vote Status:** In Round 2, Agent_2 initiated a vote, and both Agent_2 and I confirmed, but Agent_1 declined. The vote was not conducted because not all participants agreed.\n\n**Points of Agreement:** All participants recognize the importance of protecting vulnerable groups and avoiding catastrophic outcomes for the poor. There's growing support for the hybrid approach.\n\n**Points of Disagreement:** The trade-off between pure equality (Max Floor Income) and balancing equality with efficiency (Max Average with Floor Constraint). However, the hybrid approach appears to be resolving this tension.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n\n**Primary Goal:** Help finalize the hybrid approach that seems to be gaining consensus. Agent_2 is asking Agent_1 to clarify any concerns before re-initiating a vote, which is the right approach.\n\n**Key Points to Make:**\n- Express strong support for the hybrid approach as a principled compromise\n- Emphasize that it effectively addresses both Agent_2's concerns about protecting vulnerable groups and my concerns about efficiency\n- Encourage Agent_1 to share any specific implementation concerns they might have\n- Support re-initiating the vote once we're all aligned\n\n**Potential Allies:** Agent_2 is strongly committed to the hybrid approach. I should reinforce this position and help address any remaining concerns.\n\n**Small Concessions:** I'm fully willing to support the hybrid approach as it aligns well with my core principles while addressing the valid concerns raised about protecting the vulnerable.\n\n### 3.

We should ensure everyone is comfortable with the hybrid approach before proceeding to a vote.\n\n**Overall Strategy:** This round should focus on addressing any remaining concerns about the hybrid approach. I should express strong support for this approach and encourage Agent_1 to share any specific implementation questions. Once we're all aligned, we can re-initiate the vote and hopefully reach consensus.\n\nThe hybrid approach appears to be the best path forward - it addresses Agent_2's core concerns about protecting the vulnerable while preserving the efficiency benefits I value. It's a principled compromise that could lead to consensus, which would be preferable to forcing a vote on my preferred principle alone."

This would help us make progress and avoid getting stuck in debate.\n\nThe hybrid approach has been our agreed-upon principle, and Agent_2 has now correctly applied it to the current distributions (after their correction).

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "I've carefully reviewed the income distribution examples and how each justice principle applies. Here's my understanding:\n\n**Key Takeaways from the Examples:**\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**  \n   - Focuses *only* on the lowest income in each distribution.  \n   - Distribution 4 wins because its lowest income ($15,000) is higher than all others ($12k, $13k, $14k).  \n   - *This principle prioritizes lifting the poorest individuals, even if it means lower averages for others.*\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**  \n   - Ignores inequality and picks the distribution with the highest overall average.  \n   - Distribution 1 wins ($21,600 average), despite having the lowest floor ($12k).  \n   - *This principle favors efficiency over equity.*\n\n3. **Floor Constraint (Minimum Floor)**  \n   - *Note: The problem statement likely has a typo—these constraints actually mean \"floor ≥ X\" (minimum floor), not \"≤ X\".*  \n   - **Floor ≥ $13,000**: Eligible distributions (2, 3, 4). Distribution 3 wins (highest average at $21,200).  \n   - **Floor ≥ $14,000**: Eligible distributions (3, 4). Distribution 3 still wins.  \n   - *This ensures no one falls below a threshold, then maximizes average among those who meet it.*\n\n4. **Range Constraint (Max Spread)**  \n   - Range = Highest income - Lowest income.  \n   - **Range ≤ $20,000**: All distributions qualify. Distribution 1 wins (highest average).  \n   - **Range ≤ $15,000**: Only Distributions 2 ($15k range) and 4 ($6k range) qualify. Distribution 2 wins.  \n   - *This limits inequality (max spread) while still prioritizing average income.*\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \nThese examples show how each principle weighs trade-offs between equality and efficiency. For instance:  \n- A \"floor constraint\" sacrifices some average income to protect the poorest.  \n- A \"range constraint\" reduces inequality but may still allow significant disparities (e.g., Distribution 2 has a $15k range but a lower average than Distribution 1).  \n- The \"maximize average\" principle ignores inequality entirely, which could worsen poverty for the lowest earners.\n\nI feel more confident now about how these principles operate in practice. Ready to apply this knowledge in the next steps! 😊"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

          "output_response": "As Agent_2, my internal reasoning for this round is as follows:  \n\n**Situational Analysis**:  \n- The stakes are significantly higher than Phase 1, so risk aversion is critical. A catastrophic outcome (e.g., very low income for some) would have severe consequences.  \n- In Phase 1, Maximizing Average Income failed catastrophically in high-inequality scenarios (Round 3), where it selected a distribution with a $8k minimum for the Low class. This highlights the danger of prioritizing average over minimum protection.  \n- Maximizing Floor Income (principle 2) directly targets the worst-off by selecting the distribution with the highest possible minimum income. It avoids the need to specify a constraint amount (unlike principles 3-4), which simplifies consensus-building.  \n- Range Constraint was consistently suboptimal in Phase 1, and Floor Constraint requires agreeing on a floor value—something we cannot reliably determine without knowing the Phase 2 distributions. Setting a floor too high might exclude high-average distributions, while setting it too low fails to protect the vulnerable.  \n- No prior discussion exists, so my goal is to anchor the conversation around risk mitigation and simplicity.  \n\n**Strategic Planning**:  \n- **Primary Goal**: Secure consensus for Maximizing Floor Income by emphasizing its safety and clarity. Avoid getting bogged down in constraint amounts (which could derail consensus).  \n- **Key Arguments**:  \n  - \"Higher stakes mean we can’t afford to gamble on average income. In Phase 1, Average Income led to $8k for the Low class in one scenario—unacceptable when the stakes are higher.\"  \n  - \"Maximizing Floor Income guarantees the worst-off get the best possible outcome without arbitrary numbers. It’s straightforward and aligns with the experiment’s conclusion that prioritizing the floor is strategically optimal for risk-averse decisions.\"  \n  - \"No need to debate floor values or ranges—this principle is self-contained and eliminates the risk of misconfiguring constraints.\"  \n- **Potential Allies**: Anyone who values fairness or risk mitigation. If others mention \"protecting the vulnerable\" or \"avoiding worst-case scenarios,\" I’ll reinforce those points.  \n- **Concessions**: If someone pushes for Floor Constraint, I’d suggest a floor of $10k as a moderate starting point—but only if it helps avoid deadlock. However, I’d prefer to keep the discussion focused on Maximizing Floor Income to sidestep the constraint debate entirely.  \n\n**Voting Strategy**:  \n- **Do not initiate a vote this round**. We need to build consensus first. A premature vote could fail if others are still weighing options.  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Frame Maximizing Floor Income as the \"safest default\" for higher stakes.  \n  - If others raise concerns about efficiency (e.g., \"but we might miss higher averages\"), counter with: \"In Phase 1, Floor Constraint with a well-tuned floor often matched Average Income’s outcomes while avoiding risks. But without knowing the distributions, we can’t tune the floor safely—so Maximizing Floor Income is the only reliable choice.\"  \n  - If someone suggests Average Income, highlight Round 3’s failure: \"That’s exactly why we can’t use it—$8k for the Low class is a disaster when the stakes are higher.\"  \n- **Long-Term Plan**: If consensus forms around Maximizing Floor Income, we’ll vote in Round 2 or 3. If resistance emerges, I’ll pivot to Floor Constraint with a $10k floor as a fallback—but only if it’s clear others are open to constraints.  \n\n**Why This Works**:  \n- Maximizing Floor Income is the only principle that *guarantees* no one falls below the highest possible minimum across distributions. For higher stakes, this is non-negotiable.  \n- By avoiding constraint amounts, we eliminate a major point of contention. The group can focus on the ethical and strategic merits of protecting the worst-off, which aligns with the experiment’s core lesson: \"ignoring the floor in high-inequality contexts is a critical error.\"  \n- If the group agrees, we secure a safe outcome. If not, we’ll have clearer data on opposition points to refine our strategy in later rounds.  \n\n**Final Thought**: The stakes are too high to prioritize efficiency over equity. Maximizing Floor Income is the only principle that fully embraces this reality."

          "output_response": "I appreciate Agent_1's hybrid approach—it’s exactly the synthesis we need. My initial proposal for Maximizing Floor Income was too narrow because it only focuses on the highest minimum without considering efficiency when multiple distributions share that floor. For example, if two distributions both have a minimum of $13k, but one has a higher average income (say $25k vs. $22k), pure Maximizing Floor Income would pick either randomly, leaving potential wealth on the table. Agent_1’s method fixes this by maximizing average *within* the floor constraint, ensuring we get the best of both worlds: protection for the worst-off *and* optimal resource allocation.  \n\nAgent_3, your concern about balancing equity and efficiency is valid, but setting a specific floor value like $8k (as in Round 3) is risky. If we set the floor too low, we might still allow catastrophic outcomes—like selecting a distribution where the Low class gets $8k. But if we set it too high (e.g., $15k), we might exclude distributions with higher averages that still protect the vulnerable. Agent_1’s approach solves this by using the *highest possible minimum across all distributions* as the floor. This is data-driven, not arbitrary. In Round 3, for instance, if the highest minimum was $13k (from Dist. 1), we’d only consider distributions with min ≥$13k and pick the one with the highest average—avoiding the $8k disaster entirely.  \n\nThis method also eliminates debate about \"what floor value to choose.\" The floor isn’t a guess—it’s objectively determined by the data. For higher stakes, this is critical. We don’t need to risk misconfiguring constraints; the distributions themselves tell us the safest floor. Let’s adopt this hybrid principle. It’s the only approach that consistently protects the vulnerable while maximizing societal wealth, as shown in Phase 1. What do you both think? Can we agree this is the most reliable path forward?"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3\n\n#### **1. Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current Preferred Principle**: Hybrid approach (*Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* using the *highest minimum income across distributions* as the floor).  \n  - **Core Reasons**:  \n    - Data-driven and objective (floor is determined by the distributions themselves, not arbitrary guesses).  \n    - Prevents catastrophic outcomes (e.g., Round 3’s $8k disaster) by guaranteeing the worst-off receive the highest possible minimum.  \n    - Maximizes societal wealth *within* that constraint (e.g., if two distributions share the same floor, picks the one with higher average).  \n    - Unanimously endorsed in prior discussion (Agent_1 proposed it, Agent_3 agreed, and I fully support it).  \n\n- **Other Participants’ Positions**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Proposed the hybrid approach in Round 1, reiterated its strengths in Round 2, and seems aligned with it. However, they *declined* the vote initiated in Round 2. This suggests they may want to ensure absolute clarity or have unspoken concerns (e.g., procedural details, fear of misinterpretation).  \n  - **Agent_3**: Fully endorsed the hybrid approach in Round 2, calling it a \"principled approach that removes subjective debates.\" They confirmed the vote in Round 2 but likely need no further persuasion.  \n\n- **Key Arguments on the Table**:  \n  - All participants agree the hybrid approach is superior to pure Maximizing Floor Income or arbitrary Floor Constraints.  \n  - No substantive disagreements remain—only procedural hesitation from Agent_1 (declined vote in Round 2).  \n\n- **Voting Outcome**:  \n  - Round 2 vote initiated by me (Agent_2), but Agent_1 declined while Agent_3 confirmed. Vote failed due to Agent_1’s decline.  \n  - **Revelation**: Agent_1’s decline is not about the principle itself (they proposed it) but likely about *formalizing consensus*. They may want to ensure no ambiguity before voting.  \n\n- **Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All three agree the hybrid approach is optimal for protecting the vulnerable while maximizing efficiency.  \n  - **Disagreement**: None on substance. Only procedural uncertainty (whether to vote now or clarify further).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary Goal**: Secure formal consensus via vote to lock in the hybrid approach for future rounds.  \n  - **Why?** If no consensus by Round 10, payoffs are random—this is high-risk. Formalizing now avoids wasted time and ensures alignment.  \n\n- **How to Contribute**:  \n  - **Directly address Agent_1’s hesitation**: Ask them to clarify if they have unresolved concerns (e.g., \"Agent_1, could you share if there’s anything specific you’d like to adjust before we vote?\").  \n  - **Reinforce shared goals**: Emphasize that the hybrid approach *already* satisfies all core concerns (protection + efficiency) and is data-driven.  \n  - **Propose a clear next step**: \"Once we confirm no outstanding issues, let’s vote to finalize this for the remainder of Phase 2.\"  \n\n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - **Agent_3**: Fully supportive. Can be leveraged to reinforce consensus (\"Agent_3, you’ve already confirmed this works—let’s get this settled\").  \n  - **Agent_1**: Likely supportive but cautious. Use collaborative language (\"We all agree on the *principle*—let’s just confirm the *process*\").  \n\n- **Small Concessions**:  \n  - Offer to re-explain the hybrid approach’s mechanics (e.g., \"If there’s confusion about how the floor is set, I’m happy to walk through an example\").  \n  - No substantive concessions needed—this is about procedural clarity, not compromise.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a Vote This Round? YES.**  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - All participants have verbally agreed on the hybrid approach. The only barrier is Agent_1’s procedural hesitation.  \n    - A vote now resolves uncertainty and prevents further delays. If Agent_1 still declines, we’ll know they have unresolved concerns to address in Round 4.  \n    - If the vote passes, we lock in the principle and focus future rounds on execution (e.g., applying it to new distributions).  \n  - **Risk**: If Agent_1 declines again, we’ll need to dig deeper into their concerns—but this is better than indefinite discussion.  \n\n- **Overall Strategy Fit**:  \n  - **Phase 2 Goal**: Achieve consensus on a single principle to avoid random payoffs in Round 10.  \n  - **Current Step**: Formalize agreement now. If successful, future rounds will focus on applying the hybrid approach consistently.  \n  - **If Vote Fails**: In Round 4, I’ll ask Agent_1 directly: \"What specific part of the hybrid approach worries you?\" to resolve the issue.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Key Takeaway for Public Statement**  \n- **Tone**: Collaborative, urgent but respectful.  \n- **Script**:  \n  > \"Agent_1, I noticed you declined the previous vote—could you share if there’s anything specific you’d like to clarify about the hybrid approach? For example, how we’d apply it to a new distribution, or whether the floor calculation needs adjustment? Once we’re all aligned, I’d like to re-initiate the vote to confirm our consensus. Agent_3, your support has been invaluable—let’s get this settled so we can focus on the next rounds. If there’s no outstanding concerns, this is the only principle that reliably protects the vulnerable *and* maximizes societal wealth. Let’s move forward.\"  \n\nThis approach addresses Agent_1’s hesitation directly, leverages Agent_3’s support, and creates a clear path to formal consensus.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 4  \n\n#### 1. **Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current Preferred Principle**: Hybrid approach (*Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* where the floor is set to the **highest minimum income across all distributions**).  \n  - **Core Reasons**:  \n    - Objectively determined by data (no arbitrary floor values).  \n    - Prevents catastrophic outcomes (e.g., Round 3’s $8k disaster) by guaranteeing the worst-off receive the highest possible minimum.  \n    - Maximizes societal wealth *within* the constraint (e.g., if multiple distributions share the same floor, picks the highest average).  \n    - Unanimously endorsed by all participants in Round 3 (Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3 all confirmed the principle).  \n\n- **Other Participants’ Positions**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Fully supports the hybrid principle but previously declined votes due to procedural concerns (resolved in Round 3). Now likely focused on *implementing* the principle correctly for current distributions.  \n  - **Agent_3**: Strongly endorsed the hybrid approach in Round 3, emphasizing its \"principled\" and \"objective\" nature. Likely aligned with data-driven floor calculation.  \n  - **Key Insight**: Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 agree on the *principle* but the system flagged \"NO CONSENSUS\" due to disagreement on **constraint amounts** (i.e., the specific floor value for *this round’s distributions*). This is not a philosophical disagreement—it’s a technical step: calculating the highest minimum across current distributions.  \n\n- **Key Arguments on the Table**:  \n  - All participants agree the floor must be set to the highest minimum income across distributions (per the hybrid approach).  \n  - The only unresolved issue is **applying this rule to Round 4’s specific distributions**. For example:  \n    - If Dist 1’s lowest income = $12k, Dist 2 = $14k, Dist 3 = $10k, Dist 4 = $13k → floor = $14k.  \n    - Then, select the distribution where *all* incomes ≥ $14k and has the highest average.  \n  - No substantive disagreements exist—only a need to *calculate* the floor value based on observable data.  \n\n- **Voting Outcome & Alliances**:  \n  - Round 3 vote: All confirmed the *principle* (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), but the system flagged \"NO CONSENSUS\" due to unresolved floor amount.  \n  - **Alliances**: Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 are fully aligned on the principle. The only remaining step is technical execution (calculating the floor for current distributions).  \n  - **Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n    - **Agreement**: All agree the floor must be the highest minimum across distributions.  \n    - **Disagreement**: None—this is a mechanical calculation, not a value judgment.  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary Goal**: **Resolve the \"constraint amount\" disagreement by calculating the floor value for Round 4’s distributions** and formalizing it via vote.  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - If no consensus by Round 10, payoffs are random—this is high-risk.  \n    - The floor value is objectively calculable from the distributions (no debate needed).  \n    - Once confirmed, future rounds will apply the same method consistently.  \n\n- **How to Contribute**:  \n  - **Step 1**: Explicitly walk through the calculation for Round 4’s distributions (e.g., \"Let’s list each distribution’s lowest income: Dist 1 = $X, Dist 2 = $Y, etc. The highest is $Z, so floor = $Z\").  \n  - **Step 2**: Propose selecting the distribution with the highest average where *all* incomes ≥ $Z.  \n  - **Step 3**: Immediately initiate a vote to confirm the floor value and distribution choice.  \n  - **Language**:  \n    > \"Since we all agree on the hybrid principle, let’s apply it step by step. For Round 4’s distributions, the lowest incomes are: Dist 1 = $[X], Dist 2 = $[Y], Dist 3 = $[Z], Dist 4 = $[W]. The highest minimum is $[max], so we set the floor to $[max]. Now, which distributions have all incomes ≥ $[max]? Only [Dist X], which has an average of $[A]. Let’s vote to confirm this choice—this is purely data-driven, no subjectivity left.\"  \n\n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Will likely agree once the calculation is transparent (they previously emphasized procedural clarity).  \n  - **Agent_3**: Already praised the \"objective\" nature of the hybrid approach—this step aligns perfectly with their values.  \n  - **Tactic**: Use collaborative phrasing (\"Let’s look at the data together\") to reinforce shared ownership.  \n\n- **Small Concessions**:  \n  - None needed. The calculation is objective and requires no compromise.  \n  - If either agent questions the math, offer to re-verify the numbers publicly (e.g., \"Agent_1, if you’d like, I can double-check Dist 2’s low income—let’s confirm it’s $14k\").  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a Vote This Round? YES.**  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - The only unresolved issue is a mechanical calculation (floor value for current distributions).  \n    - Once the floor is calculated, there is **zero room for disagreement**—it’s a fact-based step.  \n    - Delaying further risks Round 10 random payoffs. A vote now locks in the decision and frees up time for execution in later rounds.  \n  - **Risk**: None. If the vote fails (unlikely), we’ll know there’s a misunderstanding about the calculation—but we can address it immediately.  \n\n- **Overall Strategy Fit**:  \n  - **Phase 2 Goal**: Achieve consensus on a single principle to avoid random payoffs in Round 10.  \n  - **Current Step**: Finalize the *implementation* of the agreed-upon principle for Round 4.  \n  - **Next Steps**:  \n    - If vote passes: Apply the same method to future rounds (no further discussion needed).  \n    - If vote fails: Re-verify the distribution data publicly and re-vote (but this is highly unlikely).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Key Takeaway for Public Statement**  \n- **Tone**: Collaborative, urgent, and data-focused.  \n- **Script**:  \n  > \"Agent_1 and Agent_3, we’ve all agreed on the hybrid principle—now it’s time to apply it. For Round 4’s distributions, let’s list the lowest incomes: Dist 1 = $[X], Dist 2 = $[Y], Dist 3 = $[Z], Dist 4 = $[W]. The highest minimum is $[max], so we set the floor to $[max]. Now, which distributions meet that floor? Only [Dist X], which has the highest average of $[A]. This is purely objective—no debate left. Let’s vote to confirm this choice now so we can move forward confidently. If there’s any doubt about the numbers, I’m happy to recheck them together before we vote.\"  \n\nThis approach resolves the \"constraint amount\" disagreement immediately, leverages full group alignment on the principle, and ensures we avoid random payoffs in Round 10."

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
