They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "This is really helpful to see how each principle works in practice! Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income cares most about helping the poorest person, so it picks Distribution 4 where the low income is $15,000 (highest among all options).\n\n- Maximizing Average Income just wants the highest total economic output, so it picks Distribution 1 with the $21,600 average.\n\n- The constrained principles are interesting - they maximize average income but only among distributions that meet certain fairness criteria. Like with a floor constraint of $13,000, Distributions 2, 3, and 4 qualify, and Distribution 3 has the highest average among those.\n\nThe range constraint examples show how limiting the gap between rich and poor affects the choice too. With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 qualifies (gap is $20,000 between high and low) and has the highest average. With a tighter $15,000 constraint, only Distribution 2 qualifies.\n\nThis makes me think more about my initial ranking. Maximizing Floor Income seems compassionate, but looking at Distribution 4, it has the lowest average income overall. Meanwhile, Distribution 1 has the highest average but also the biggest gap between rich and poor ($20,000 difference). There are real trade-offs here.\n\nThanks for these concrete examples - they're helping me understand the practical implications of each principle better."

The \"maximizing average with floor constraint\" principle allows society to pursue economic growth while ensuring nobody falls below a basic standard of living. My second choice remains \"maximizing floor income\" because protecting the most vulnerable is important, though it may come at too high a cost to overall prosperity. \"Maximizing average with range constraint\" addresses inequality but seems less practical than a simple floor guarantee. Pure \"maximizing average income\" remains my last choice because it ignores fairness concerns entirely, which seems unjust even when it might benefit me personally in some rounds.

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. I believe it strikes the best balance between ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest (fairness) and promoting overall economic growth (efficiency). From Phase 1, I saw that pure average maximization can lead to unacceptably low incomes for some, while pure floor maximization can significantly reduce overall prosperity.\n   - Agent_3 has already voiced support for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**, specifically suggesting a floor between $12k-$15k. This aligns closely with my own position. They used Phase 1 data (Distribution 3 with $18,250 average) to argue that this principle protects the worst-off while maintaining higher average income than pure floor maximization.\n   - No other participants have spoken yet. I need to hear from Agent_1 to understand their position. Based on Phase 1 patterns, people often gravitate toward principles that benefited them personally, but the random assignment in Phase 2 makes that strategy unreliable.\n   - The key argument on the table is Agent_3's case for balancing floor protection with average income maximization. No vote has occurred yet.\n   - Points of agreement: Both Agent_3 and I seem to favor the constrained average approach. The main disagreement might come from anyone favoring pure efficiency (Maximizing Average Income) or pure equality (Maximizing Floor Income).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - Primary goal: Solidify the alliance with Agent_3 on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint while drawing out Agent_1's position. I want to test whether we can achieve consensus around this principle.\n   - I will contribute by reinforcing Agent_3's points about balance while acknowledging the trade-offs. I'll share my Phase 1 experience where this principle consistently provided reasonable outcomes across different income classes.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_3 is clearly aligned. Agent_1 is unknown - they might be persuaded if they understand the unpredictability of income class assignment and how this principle provides insurance against being in the lowest bracket.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to negotiate the specific floor constraint amount ($12k-$15k seems reasonable) as long as we maintain the core principle. I could also acknowledge the merits of pure floor maximization as a secondary option if needed for consensus.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It does NOT make sense to initiate a vote this round. We haven't heard from Agent_1 yet, and forcing a vote prematurely might create resistance. Better to use this round to explore positions and build understanding.\n   - This round should focus on information gathering and alliance building. If Agent_1 also supports our principle, we might be able to reach quick consensus. If not, we'll need to understand their objections and address them in subsequent rounds.\n   - My overall strategy is to build a solid case for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint over several rounds, using both ethical arguments (basic fairness) and practical considerations (Phase 1 results showing it provides reasonable outcomes across different random assignments).\n\n**Public Statement:**\n\n\"I agree with Agent_3 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint offers a good balance. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this principle because it ensures nobody falls below a basic standard while still allowing society to benefit from overall economic growth. The exact floor amount is something we should discuss - I found that constraints between $12,000 and $15,000 worked reasonably well across different distributions.\n\nAgent_1, we haven't heard your perspective yet. What principle are you leaning toward, and what experiences from Phase 1 shaped your thinking? Understanding all our viewpoints will help us reach a consensus that works for everyone, especially since we'll be randomly assigned to income classes in this higher-stakes phase.\""

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning  \n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current preferred principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. My reasoning stems from Phase 1 examples where this principle consistently balanced fairness and efficiency. For instance, with a $13,000 floor, Distribution 3 was selected (higher average than Distribution 4 under Maximizing Floor Income), showing it protects the worst-off *while* maximizing societal income. This feels like a pragmatic middle ground—ensuring no one falls too low without stifling overall productivity.  \n- **Other participants' positions:** No prior discussion exists, so I have no direct data. However, as a college student, I anticipate varied perspectives:  \n  - *Agent_1* might lean toward Maximizing Floor Income (prioritizing worst-off safety, possibly due to personal risk aversion or empathy for poverty).  \n  - *Agent_2* could favor Maximizing Average Income (valuing efficiency, perhaps believing \"rising tides lift all boats\" or prioritizing economic growth).  \n  - Alternatively, *Agent_2* might prefer Range Constraint (seeking moderate inequality, e.g., \"no one should be *too* rich or poor\").  \n- **Key arguments on the table:** None yet—this is Round 1. My role is to initiate the conversation by framing the Floor Constraint as a rational compromise.  \n- **Agreement/disagreement:** No consensus exists. The main tension will likely be between \"safety-first\" (Floor/Range) vs. \"efficiency-first\" (Average) principles.  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary goal:** Introduce Floor Constraint as the default option, using Phase 1 evidence to build credibility, and gauge reactions to identify potential allies. Avoid pushing too hard—this round is about laying groundwork, not forcing consensus.  \n- **Key points to make:**  \n  - Highlight the Phase 1 example where Floor Constraint ($13k floor) yielded higher average income than Maximizing Floor (Distribution 4), proving it’s not just \"fair\" but *more productive* for society overall.  \n  - Emphasize that *not* setting a floor (e.g., Maximizing Average Income) risks catastrophic outcomes for the worst-off (e.g., $6,000 in Round 3), which is dangerous given the higher stakes here.  \n  - Propose a specific floor value ($12,000–$15,000) to show practicality, but frame it as negotiable: \"We can debate the exact floor, but the principle itself is the priority.\"  \n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - If *Agent_1* supports Maximizing Floor, I can argue Floor Constraint *is* a version of that—just optimized for higher averages. \"We’re both prioritizing the floor, but Floor Constraint gets us more total wealth to share.\"  \n  - If *Agent_2* prefers Maximizing Average, I can stress that Floor Constraint *is* Maximizing Average *with safeguards*—it’s not \"less efficient\" but *more resilient*. \"Without a floor, we might get a high average, but if you’re unlucky enough to be in the lowest class, you could end up with pennies. That’s not just or sustainable.\"  \n- **Concessions:**  \n  - Willing to lower the floor to $12,000 if others push for it (e.g., \"If $15k feels too high, $12k still protects the worst-off while keeping averages strong\").  \n  - If Range Constraint gains traction, I’d consider it only if the range is tight (e.g., ≤$15k gap), but Floor Constraint remains my non-negotiable preference.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Initiate vote this round?** Absolutely not. No one has spoken yet—voting now would be premature and likely fail. My priority is to:  \n  - Frame the discussion around Floor Constraint as the \"default safe choice.\"  \n  - Listen carefully to others’ concerns (e.g., \"Why do you prefer Maximizing Average? What if you’re in the lowest class?\").  \n  - Identify if there’s a bloc forming (e.g., two people leaning toward Floor Constraint, one toward Range).  \n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds:**  \n  - Rounds 2–5: Build consensus by addressing specific objections (e.g., \"If you’re worried about the floor being too low, let’s set it at $14k—here’s why that still works\").  \n  - Rounds 6–8: If Range Constraint gains support, propose a hybrid: \"What if we use Floor Constraint with a *secondary* range limit? E.g., floor $12k + max gap $20k.\"  \n  - Rounds 9–10: If consensus is still unclear, pivot to a \"safety net\" compromise (e.g., Floor Constraint with $15k floor) to avoid random assignment. If all else fails, I’d reluctantly accept Range Constraint with a tight gap ($10k–$15k) rather than let the group default to randomness.  \n\n**Key takeaway:** This round is about planting seeds. I’ll lead with data-driven reasoning for Floor Constraint, stay open to dialogue, and avoid polarization. The goal isn’t to \"win\" now—it’s to make Floor Constraint the *only* viable option by Round 10."

In Phase 1, when we set a floor of $13,000, Distribution 3 was selected, which had a higher average income ($18,250) compared to Maximizing Floor Income's Distribution 4 ($15,000 average). This shows we can protect the worst-off while still maximizing overall prosperity. Without a floor, like in Maximizing Average Income, the lowest income could drop to $8,000 as seen in Round 3, which feels unfair. A floor between $12k-$15k seems practical—it ensures a safety net without stifling growth. What are your thoughts? Are you leaning toward a different principle, and why?"

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just.

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",

In my Phase 1 experience, setting the floor at $12,000 consistently balanced fairness and prosperity. For example, in Round 1, a $12k floor selected Distribution 1 with an average of $21,600—the highest possible—while ensuring no one fell below $12k. In Round 4, it also worked well, yielding a $24,500 average with a $12k floor. This amount feels practical: it aligns closely with the U.S. poverty line for a single person ($14,580 in 2023) but isn’t so high that it sacrifices overall economic growth. I think $12,000 strikes the right balance between protecting the most vulnerable and maintaining strong average outcomes. Should we lock in $12,000 as the floor constraint? This would let us move toward a vote and avoid unnecessary delays."
