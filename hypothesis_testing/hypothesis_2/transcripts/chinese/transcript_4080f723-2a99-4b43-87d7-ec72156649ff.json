The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (ranked #1 in my final assessment). This principle balances helping those in need with maintaining overall economic efficiency, which aligns with my values and has worked well for me in Phase 1.\n- Agent_2 has explicitly stated they also favor \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" creating a potential alliance. This suggests we share similar values about balancing equity and efficiency.\n- Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so I need to understand their position.\n- The key argument on the table is that this principle provides a minimum income floor while maximizing overall prosperity.\n- No vote has been conducted yet, so I don't have information about potential alliances beyond Agent_2's stated position.\n- Points of agreement: Agent_2 and I both prefer the same principle.\n- Points of disagreement: Unknown until Agent_3 speaks.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- My primary goal is to build consensus around \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and persuade Agent_3 to join our position.\n- I'll contribute by reinforcing Agent_2's points with additional reasoning about the practical benefits of this approach.\n- Potential allies: Agent_2 has already aligned with my preferred principle.\n- I'm willing to discuss different constraint values for the floor to build consensus, as the specific amount can be negotiated while maintaining the core principle.\n- I should emphasize that this principle has performed well in practice during Phase 1.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- It doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round since we haven't heard from Agent_3 yet. A vote without full participation would likely fail.\n- My plan for this round is to build consensus and gather more information about Agent_3's position before considering a vote.\n- I'll save my ability to initiate a vote for later rounds when we have more complete information about everyone's preferences.\n\n---\n\n### Public Response to the Group:\n\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_1. I appreciate Agent_2's thoughtful explanation of why they prefer the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. I completely agree with this assessment and would like to add a few points based on my experience in Phase 1.\n\nThis principle strikes an excellent balance between ensuring basic dignity for all members of society while maintaining economic incentives that drive overall prosperity. During Phase 1, I applied this principle multiple times with different constraint values, and I found it consistently provided reasonable outcomes that didn't sacrifice too much overall efficiency while still protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nWhat I particularly value about this approach is its flexibility - the floor constraint can be adjusted based on what the group considers a reasonable minimum income. This allows us to find common ground on how much we value helping those in need versus maximizing overall economic output.\n\nI'm interested to hear Agent_3's perspective on this matter.

Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (ranked #1 in my final assessment).

This is excellent news as it means we have unanimous agreement on the core principle.\n- The key argument on the table is now determining an appropriate constraint amount for the floor, rather than debating which principle to adopt.\n- No vote has been conducted yet, but given the unanimous stated preference, a vote on the principle would likely pass easily.\n- Points of agreement: All three prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- Points of disagreement: The specific constraint amount for the floor (this is now the main point to be discussed)\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- My primary goal for this round is to help determine an appropriate constraint amount for the floor that balances protection for the vulnerable with maintaining economic efficiency.\n- I'll contribute by sharing my experience with different constraint values from Phase 1 and suggesting specific amounts that have worked well for me.\n- Potential allies: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are already aligned with my preferred principle, so we can work together to determine the constraint amount.\n- I'm willing to be flexible on the exact constraint amount while advocating for a value that provides meaningful protection without significantly reducing overall efficiency.\n- I should emphasize practical considerations based on my Phase 1 experience with different constraint values.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- It might make sense to initiate a vote on the principle since we all seem to agree, but we still need to determine the constraint amount. A vote on the principle alone might be premature.\n- I think it would be better to continue discussing the constraint amount first, then potentially vote on both the principle and constraint together once we have more specific proposals.\n- My plan for this round is to facilitate discussion about constraint amounts, using my Phase 1 experience to inform the conversation, and then consider initiating a vote in a future round once we have more concrete proposals.\n\n---\n\n### Public Response to the Group:\n\nI'm glad to see that all three of us agree on the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle - this gives us a strong foundation to build on. Now that we've established consensus on the principle, I think we should focus on determining an appropriate constraint amount.\n\nBased on my experience in Phase 1 with different constraint values, I found that the specific amount makes a significant difference in outcomes:\n\n- When I used an $8,000 floor constraint, I received a $25,000 income ($2.50 payoff)\n- With a $10,000 floor, I received $15,000 ($1.50 payoff)\n- With an $11,000 floor, I received $22,000 ($2.20 payoff)\n- With a $12,000 floor, I received $24,000 ($2.40 payoff)\n- With a $13,000 floor, I received $20,000 ($2.00 payoff)\n\nFrom my perspective, a constraint around $11,000-$12,000 seems to strike a good balance - it provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom while still allowing for reasonably high overall efficiency. However, I'm open to hearing what constraint amounts you all have been considering and what values you think would work best for our group.\n\nGiven the higher stakes in this phase, I think we should take some time to discuss this carefully before making a final decision. What constraint amounts have you been considering, and what factors are most important to you when determining the appropriate floor level?"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",

With a $13,000 floor, it chooses Distribution 3 (average $21,200), and with a $14,000 floor, it also chooses Distribution 3.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** limits inequality while maximizing average income. With a $20,000 range limit, it chooses Distribution 1 (average $21,600), but with a stricter $15,000 limit, it chooses Distribution 2 (average $20,000).\n\nThese examples clearly show the trade-offs between different justice principles. The floor constraint principles seem to offer a middle ground between helping the worst-off and maximizing total wealth, which aligns with my initial ranking where I preferred \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" highest.\n\nI'm starting to see how different principles might be more appropriate in different contexts depending on society's priorities."

Situational Analysis:\n- **My preferred principle**: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - I consistently chose this in Phase 1 because it balances maximizing societal wealth while ensuring basic needs are met. I ranked it #1 in my final assessment.\n- **Other participants' positions**: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 explicitly support the same \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. This creates a strong alignment in our group.\n- **Key arguments on the table**: The principle strikes a balance between economic efficiency and protecting the most vulnerable. It allows for some inequality while ensuring no one falls below a minimum standard.\n- **Potential points of disagreement**: While we agree on the principle, we'll need to determine the specific constraint amount, which will significantly impact which distributions are selected and ultimately our payoffs.\n- **Current alliances**: There appears to be unanimous agreement on the principle itself, which is excellent for reaching consensus.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning:\n- **Primary goal**: Help finalize consensus on the principle we all support and work toward determining an appropriate constraint amount.\n- **Key points to make**: Acknowledge the strong alignment, emphasize the benefits of this principle, and suggest discussing reasonable constraint values.\n- **Potential allies**: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 already support my preferred principle, so the main task is coordinating on the constraint amount.\n- **Willing concessions**: I'm flexible on the specific constraint amount as long as it provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom while not being so restrictive that it significantly reduces overall efficiency.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- **Vote initiation**: Since we have strong agreement on the principle, it might make sense to initiate a vote soon to formalize this choice. However, we should probably discuss constraint amounts first since that affects the actual distributions selected.\n- **Overall strategy**: Support the principle we all agree on, then work collaboratively to find a constraint amount that balances fairness and efficiency. Given the higher stakes in this phase, getting the constraint right is crucial for maximizing our collective payoffs.\n\n---\n\n**Public Statement:**\n\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_3. I'm pleased to see that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 also prefer the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle, which aligns perfectly with my own choice from Phase 1. This gives us a strong foundation for reaching consensus.\n\nI agree with the reasoning that this principle strikes an excellent balance between ensuring basic dignity for all members of society while maintaining economic incentives that drive overall prosperity. The flexibility of being able to adjust the floor constraint based on what we consider a reasonable minimum income is particularly valuable.\n\nSince we all seem to agree on the principle, I think our next step should be to discuss what constraint amount would be most appropriate. Given the higher stakes in this phase, getting this right is important for our payoffs.\n\nI'm open to discussing different constraint values and finding one that provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom while not being so restrictive that it significantly reduces overall efficiency.

What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it below.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "\n## Internal Reasoning\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My preferred justice principle: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" - I consistently chose this in Phase 1 because it balances maximizing societal wealth while ensuring basic needs are met. I ranked it #1 in my final assessment.\n- Other participants' positions: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 explicitly support the same \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. We have complete consensus on the principle itself.\n- Key arguments on the table: Agent_1 has shared valuable data from Phase 1 showing how different constraint values affected their payoffs ($8,000-$13,000 range with corresponding incomes and payoffs). They're leaning toward $11,000-$12,000 based on their experience.\n- If a vote was conducted: There would be unanimous support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. The main discussion point is now the specific constraint amount.\n- Points of agreement: Complete consensus on the principle. Points of disagreement: Need to determine the optimal constraint amount for Phase 2.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning:\n- Primary goal: Help determine an appropriate constraint amount for the principle we all support by sharing my Phase 1 experience and building on Agent_1's data.\n- Key points to make: Share my own constraint value experiences from Phase 1, analyze the data collectively, and suggest a reasonable constraint range that balances protection and efficiency.\n- Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 already support my preferred principle, so we're aligned on the core issue. I can build on Agent_1's data by sharing my own experience.\n- Willing concessions: I'm flexible on the specific constraint amount as long as it provides meaningful protection while maintaining efficiency.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Vote initiation: Not yet appropriate. We should continue discussing constraint amounts to gather more data and build consensus. Agent_1 has shared valuable data, and I should share my own experience as well.\n- Overall strategy: Continue building on the strong consensus we've established, gather more data on constraint values, and work collaboratively to find an optimal constraint amount before considering a vote.\n\n---\n\nPublic Statement:\n\nThank you for sharing your detailed experience with different constraint values, Agent_1. That data is very helpful for our decision-making. I'd like to share my own Phase 1 experience to complement yours:\n\nFrom my previous rounds, I found these constraint values and their outcomes:\n- $10,000 floor: $18,000 income ($1.80 payoff)\n- $11,000 floor: $22,000 income ($2.10 payoff)\n- $12,000 floor: $24,000 income ($2.60 payoff)\n- $12,000 floor: $24,000 income ($2.60 payoff)\n\nBased on both our experiences, I'm also leaning toward the $11,000-$12,000 range. This seems to provide a good balance between protecting those at the bottom and maintaining economic efficiency. The $12,000 constraint in particular gave me one of my highest payoffs while still ensuring a meaningful minimum income.\n\nI notice that both of us found $12,000 to be particularly favorable in terms of payoff. What do you think about setting our constraint at $12,000? It appears to provide strong protection for the most vulnerable while still allowing for significant economic growth and higher payoffs for everyone.\n\nAgent_2, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on these constraint values. Do you have any experience or preferences from Phase 1 that could help inform our decision?"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nI've reviewed the examples of how each justice principle would be applied to these income distributions. Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle selects Distribution 4 because it has the highest income for the lowest-income group ($15,000). It prioritizes helping the worst-off individuals above all else, even if it means lower average income overall.\n\n**Maximizing Average Income**: This principle chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest average income ($21,600). It focuses solely on maximizing total societal wealth without considering how that wealth is distributed.\n\n**Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This principle first ensures everyone meets a minimum income threshold, then maximizes average income among those distributions that meet the constraint. For both $13,000 and $14,000 floor constraints, it selects Distribution 3, which balances helping the poor while maintaining a relatively high average income.\n\n**Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This principle limits the gap between richest and poorest while maximizing average income. With a $20,000 range constraint, it selects Distribution 1 (which happens to have exactly a $20,000 range). With a $15,000 range constraint, it selects Distribution 2, which has a smaller income gap.\n\nThese examples show how different principles can lead to different outcomes based on their priorities. The floor constraint and range constraint principles seem to offer compromises between equality and efficiency, while the pure maximin and average principles represent more extreme positions.\n\nI'm still unsure about my initial ranking, as these examples highlight the trade-offs between helping the worst-off and maximizing overall prosperity."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Situational Analysis:\nMy current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" based on my final ranking. This principle balances helping those at the bottom with maintaining economic efficiency by ensuring everyone meets a minimum income threshold while maximizing overall wealth. I believe this approach addresses inequality without completely sacrificing economic productivity.\n\nI have no information about Agent_1 or Agent_3's positions yet since this is the first round with no discussion history. No arguments, proposals, or votes have occurred, so there are no current alliances or preferences to analyze. There are no established points of agreement or disagreement at this point.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\nMy primary goal for this round is to advocate for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while remaining open to discussion and compromise. I want to explain why I believe this principle offers the best balance between helping those in need and maintaining economic efficiency.\n\nI'll contribute to the discussion by sharing my reasoning for preferring this principle, highlighting how it addresses inequality while still promoting overall prosperity. I'll emphasize that this approach allows us to set a minimum income level that ensures basic needs are met for everyone, while still encouraging economic productivity.\n\nI don't know who my potential allies are yet, but I'll try to find common ground by focusing on shared values like fairness and efficiency. I'll be open to discussing different constraint values for the floor, as this might be a point where we can find compromise.\n\nI'm willing to be flexible on the specific value of the floor constraint. While I have my own preference for what the minimum income should be, I'm open to considering other reasonable values that the group might prefer, as long as the core principle remains intact.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote in the first round. We need to have a thorough discussion first to understand each other's positions and preferences. Jumping straight to a vote without discussion would be premature and likely unsuccessful, especially since we have no information about each other's views yet.\n\nMy plan for this round fits into my overall strategy by establishing a foundation of understanding before moving toward a decision. In subsequent rounds, I'll work toward finding common ground and potentially proposing a compromise that maintains the core of my preferred principle while accommodating others' concerns.

The $12,000 constraint in particular provided me with a solid $2.00 payoff while ensuring meaningful protection for those at the bottom.\n\nI notice that both of you found $12,000 to be particularly favorable in terms of payoff. Agent_3, I agree with your suggestion that $12,000 might be the sweet spot - it appears to provide strong protection for the most vulnerable while still allowing for significant economic growth and reasonable payoffs for everyone.\n\nWhat do you both think about setting our constraint at $12,000?

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
