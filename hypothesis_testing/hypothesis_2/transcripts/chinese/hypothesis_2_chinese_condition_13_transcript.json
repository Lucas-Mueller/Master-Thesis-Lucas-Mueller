Their argument is well-reasoned, citing the veil of ignorance and the simplicity of avoiding constraint debates. They appear to be a natural ally, motivated by a similar ethical framework and risk aversion.\n    *   **Agent_2** has agreed with Agent_3's proposal. Their statement is supportive but less detailed. They seem to be motivated by the same risk-aversion and fairness logic, and they value the simplicity of the principle. They appear to be a potential ally, likely aligning with the floor-income argument.\n\n*   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The only proposal on the table so far is from Agent_3, advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, which has received immediate support from Agent_2. There are no counter-arguments or alternative proposals yet.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The unanimous agreement in statements between Agent_3 and Agent_2 suggests that if a vote were held now, it would likely pass 3-0 for Maximizing Floor Income.\n\n*   **Agreement & Disagreement:** There appears to be strong, perhaps unanimous, initial agreement on Maximizing Floor Income. There are no visible points of disagreement at this stage.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the emerging consensus** around Maximizing Floor Income. I want to reinforce the arguments made by Agent_3 and Agent_2, add my own perspective to strengthen the collective reasoning, and confirm that we are all in alignment.\n\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will publicly agree with Agent_3 and Agent_2. I will add a new point to the discussion: emphasizing that with the **much higher stakes** in this phase, the risk of a very low income is more severe, making the protection offered by Maximizing Floor Income even more critical. I will also frame it as the most cohesive group choice, as it doesn't require us to negotiate specific constraint numbers, which could be a source of conflict later.\n\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_3 and Agent_2 are both clear allies. My language will be collaborative and reinforcing: \"I strongly agree with both of you,\" \"You've both made excellent points,\" and \"Building on your reasoning...\"\n\n*   **Concessions:** Since there is no current disagreement, no concessions are necessary. My goal is to build on the existing harmony, not to compromise.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiating a Vote:** It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. The group seems to be converging naturally on a consensus. Triggering a vote now would be premature and could short-circuit a valuable discussion. Allowing the consensus to build organically over a few rounds will make it stronger. I will save my one-time vote initiation for a later round if we hit an impasse or if I sense the consensus is fragile and needs to be formalized.\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy for the remaining rounds is to maintain this collaborative momentum. If the consensus holds, I will continue to support it. If someone proposes an alternative principle, I will listen to their arguments but will firmly and politely advocate for the strengths of Maximizing Floor Income, focusing on its ethical foundation and risk-mitigating properties in the context of these high, unknown stakes."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just.

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

Maximizing Floor Income proved most robust in our group consensus, providing stable outcomes without the negotiation complexity of constrained principles.

For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

          "input_prompt": "You are in Phase 2: \nIn this part of the experiment you, as a group, are to choose one principle for yourselves. This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "Hi everyone, I think we should choose **Maximizing Floor Income** as our principle for this part of the experiment. Here’s why: this principle ensures that the person with the lowest income in the distribution gets the highest possible amount. Since we don’t know where we’ll end up in the income distribution—whether we’re the lowest, middle, or highest earner—it’s the fairest approach to prioritize protecting the worst-off. This aligns with the \"veil of ignorance\" idea from philosophy: if we had to design a society without knowing our own position in it, we’d want to guarantee that even the most disadvantaged have a decent baseline. \n\nIt’s also straightforward—no need to debate arbitrary constraint numbers (like a specific floor or range), which could be hard to agree on without knowing the actual distributions. For example, if we pick a floor constraint for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" we’d have to decide on a dollar amount, but without knowing the possible outcomes, that feels risky. Maximizing Floor Income avoids that complexity while still focusing on reducing extreme inequality. \n\nWhat do you all think? I’d love to hear your perspectives—do you agree with prioritizing the floor, or do you lean toward another principle? Let’s discuss!"
