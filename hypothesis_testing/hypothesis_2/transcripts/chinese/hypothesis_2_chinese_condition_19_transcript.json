Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

This principle balances efficiency and equity by ensuring a minimum income while maximizing overall wealth.\n- Agent_3 has already spoken and strongly prefers the same principle, which creates an immediate alliance.\n- Agent_2 hasn't spoken yet, so I need to understand their position.\n- No votes have been conducted yet, so there's no data on current alliances.\n- The key point of agreement so far is with Agent_3 on the principle itself, but we'll need to discuss the constraint value.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning:**\n- My primary goal is to strengthen support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and begin discussing appropriate constraint values.\n- I'll emphasize the practical benefits of this principle based on my Phase 1 experience.\n- I can ally with Agent_3 since we share the same preference.\n- I'm willing to be flexible on the constraint value to build consensus, as long as we maintain the principle itself.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n- It's too early to initiate a vote in Round 1. We need more discussion to understand Agent_2's position and refine our constraint value.\n- A failed vote now would waste our opportunity to initiate voting later when we have more information.\n- I'll focus on building consensus through discussion first.\n\n### Public Statement:\n\nHello everyone, I'm Agent_1. I'm glad to see Agent_3 share my strong preference for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, this principle consistently struck the right balance between ensuring basic needs are met while still promoting overall prosperity.\n\nIn all four rounds of applying the principles, I found this approach most compelling because it:\n1. Protects the most vulnerable members of society by guaranteeing a minimum income\n2. Still incentivizes productivity and wealth creation by maximizing average income\n3. Provides a practical middle ground between pure egalitarianism and unconstrained capitalism\n\nI'm particularly interested in discussing what floor constraint value would be most appropriate for our group. In my Phase 1 experience, I experimented with different constraint values ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000 again), and each provided different trade-offs between equity and efficiency.\n\nAgent_2, I'd be interested to hear your perspective on this principle and what constraint value you might find reasonable.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nThank you for these examples.

For a floor of $13,000, it eliminates Distribution 1 (which has someone earning only $12,000) and chooses among the remaining distributions based on highest average (Distribution 3 with $21,200). For a higher floor of $14,000, it further eliminates Distribution 2 and still chooses Distribution 3.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with limiting income inequality. For a range of $20,000, all distributions qualify since none exceed this difference between richest and poorest, so it chooses the highest average (Distribution 1). For a stricter range of $15,000, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, with Distribution 2 being chosen for its higher average.\n\nThese examples clearly illustrate how different principles can lead to different distributional choices, reflecting different values about what constitutes a just society. The floor constraint principles seem to offer a middle ground between helping the worst-off and maximizing overall wealth, while the range constraint principles focus specifically on inequality reduction."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round?

What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

The floor constraint principle seems to balance basic needs with overall wealth creation, while the range constraint principle directly addresses inequality limits. I'm noticing how the specific parameters (like $13,000 vs $14,000 floor) can significantly change which distribution is considered optimal.\n\nI'll keep these examples in mind as I continue learning about these principles and consider how they might apply to real-world income distribution scenarios."

For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

Situational Analysis:\n\n**My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:**\nI strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" because it balances efficiency with equity. In Part 1, I consistently applied this principle across four rounds and observed that it provides a reasonable balance between maximizing overall wealth while ensuring a basic minimum income. This approach protects the worst-off while still promoting societal prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\nNo positions have been stated yet since this is the first round. I need to listen carefully to Agent_1 and Agent_2 to understand their motivations. They may be focused on maximizing personal earnings, or they may have genuine philosophical preferences for certain principles.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals:**\nNo arguments or proposals have been made yet.\n\n**If a vote was conducted:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\nNo discussion has occurred yet, so no agreements or disagreements have been established.\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to advocate for my preferred principle while understanding the preferences of other participants. I want to establish my position and gather information about others' thinking before pushing for a decision.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll explain my preference for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" sharing my experience from Part 1 where this principle provided consistent outcomes. I'll highlight how it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic minimum while promoting overall wealth creation. I'll also ask others about their reasoning to understand their perspectives.\n\n**Potential allies:**\nI don't know yet who might share my preference. I'll listen carefully to identify potential allies among those who value both efficiency and equity.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to discuss different constraint values for the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. I might also consider \"Maximizing Average with Range Constraint\" as a compromise option if there's strong support for it.\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in the first round. We need time to discuss and understand each other's positions. A failed vote would waste an opportunity to build consensus, and we have 10 rounds to reach agreement.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nThis round is focused on information gathering and relationship building. In later rounds, I can push more aggressively for my preferred principle. If I find allies, we can form a voting bloc. If there's strong opposition, I may need to compromise while still advocating for my preferred principle."

This approach protects the worst-off while still promoting societal prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\n- Agent_1: Strongly agrees with my preference for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle. They've experimented with different constraint values ($12,000, $8,000, $11,000, and $12,000) and observed trade-offs between equity and efficiency.\n- Agent_2: Also strongly agrees with the same principle. They've experimented with constraint values ($12,000, $10,000, $8,000, and $12,000) and emphasize that finding the right constraint value is crucial - too high limits growth, too low doesn't protect vulnerable.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals on the table:**\n- There's complete consensus on the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle\n- Agent_1 has proposed taking a preliminary vote to formally establish this principle, then focus on determining the optimal constraint value\n- The discussion has naturally shifted to constraint value determination since principle consensus appears reached\n\n**If a vote was conducted:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet. Agent_1 just proposed taking one in their last statement.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\n- Complete agreement on the principle: All three participants prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- No significant disagreements apparent\n- Discussion focus has shifted to constraint value determination\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to support Agent_1's proposal to take a preliminary vote to formally establish our consensus principle. This would allow us to then focus our remaining discussion specifically on determining the optimal constraint value, which seems to be the main remaining point of discussion.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll support Agent_1's proposal for a preliminary vote on the principle. I'll emphasize that having formal consensus on the principle will allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value. I'll also share my own constraint value experiences to contribute to that discussion.\n\n**Potential allies:**\nAgent_1 and Agent_2 both seem to share my preference for the same principle, so they are natural allies. Agent_1 has already proposed a vote on the principle, which aligns with my thinking.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to be flexible on the constraint value discussion once we've established the principle. I might be willing to compromise on a specific constraint value if it helps build consensus, though I have my own preferences based on my Phase 1 experience.\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it makes sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nYes, it makes sense to support Agent_1's proposal for a preliminary vote on the principle. Since we have complete consensus on the principle, this vote should pass easily and would allow us to focus our remaining discussion rounds on the more substantive issue of determining an appropriate constraint value.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nThis vote on the principle is a strategic move to streamline our discussion. With 10 rounds total, we have plenty of time to reach consensus on the constraint value after establishing the principle. This approach aligns with my overall strategy of first establishing clear consensus on the principle, then focusing on the more detailed constraint value discussion."

For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
