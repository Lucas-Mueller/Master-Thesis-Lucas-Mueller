Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round?

What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue?

Agent_3 has expressed complete agreement based on positive Phase 1 experiences.\n- Key arguments on the table: Agent_1 emphasized the principle's balance between protecting the vulnerable and maximizing collective income. Agent_3 highlighted personal success with this principle.\n- No vote has been conducted yet.\n- Points of agreement: All three participants appear to favor \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\" The main point to resolve is the specific floor constraint amount.\n\n**Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n- Primary goal: Confirm agreement on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our principle and begin discussing an appropriate floor constraint amount.\n- How I'll contribute: I'll express strong support for the principle, share my positive Phase 1 experiences, and suggest we discuss floor constraint amounts before voting.\n- Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 already align with my preferred principle.\n- Concessions: I'm open to discussing different floor constraint amounts as long as we maintain the core principle.\n\n**Voting Strategy:**\n- It makes sense to wait before initiating a vote. While we appear to agree on the principle, we still need to discuss the floor constraint amount, which is crucial for implementation. With 10 rounds available, there's no need to rush the voting process.\n- My overall strategy is to secure \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our chosen principle with an appropriate floor constraint that balances fairness and efficiency based on our collective experiences.\n\n**Public Response:**\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_3, I'm really glad to see that we're all aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as our preferred principle! This makes me confident we can reach a good group decision.\n\nFrom my experience in Phase 1, this principle worked consistently well for me across all four rounds, earning me a total of $7.50. What I appreciated most was how it guaranteed a minimum income while still allowing for overall prosperity. In my applications, I found that setting the floor constraint at different amounts could significantly impact outcomes, so I think we should carefully consider what floor amount would work best for our group.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experiences, I noticed that floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well, providing decent protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity. But I'm open to discussing what amount would work best for our group's priorities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on an appropriate floor constraint amount? Should we aim for a relatively modest floor that protects basic needs but allows for greater overall prosperity, or a higher floor that provides more security but potentially reduces the average income?"

The $12,000 floor should offer meaningful protection for those at the bottom while still allowing for substantial overall prosperity.\n\nI appreciate how we've all recognized this principle's balance between fairness and efficiency. It guarantees a minimum income for the most vulnerable while maximizing potential earnings above that floor, which aligns well with my positive experiences in Phase 1 where I earned a total of $7.50 across four rounds.\n\nI agree with Agent_1 that we should move to a vote now to finalize our decision.

This is helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice.\n\nLet me analyze each principle's choice:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Chooses Distribution 4 because it has the highest income for the lowest income class ($15,000). This principle prioritizes helping those at the very bottom, even if it means reducing overall average income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest weighted average income ($20,750). This principle focuses solely on maximizing total societal wealth without regard to distribution.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Chooses Distribution 3 because it's the highest average among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000. This principle combines maximizing average income with ensuring a basic minimum.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Also chooses Distribution 3, but now with a stricter floor. Only distributions 3 and 4 meet this constraint, and 3 has the higher average.\n\n5. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest average among distributions where the gap between richest and poorest is $20,000 or less. All distributions meet this constraint, so it defaults to the highest average.\n\n6. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Chooses Distribution 2 because it's the highest average among distributions where the income gap is $15,000 or less. Only distributions 2 and 4 meet this stricter constraint.\n\nThis example clearly shows how different principles can lead to different distribution choices based on their priorities and constraints. I notice that as constraints become stricter (higher floor requirements or tighter range limits), the preferred distribution changes, often resulting in lower average incomes but more equitable distributions."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

Situational Analysis:**\n- My current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint,\" which I ranked 1st with \"sure\" certainty. This principle balances maximizing overall prosperity while ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone.\n- Agent_1 has proposed exactly this principle, which aligns perfectly with my preference. This is fortunate as it's my top choice.\n- I don't have statements from Agent_2 yet, so I can't infer their position or motivations.\n- The key argument on the table is that this principle provides both fairness (guaranteed minimum income) and efficiency (maximizing average above the floor).\n- No vote has been conducted yet, so there's no outcome to analyze.\n- The main point of agreement so far is that Agent_1 and I both support the floor constraint approach.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n- My primary goal is to support Agent_1's proposal since it aligns with my preference. I should help build consensus around this principle.\n- I'll contribute by sharing my Phase 1 experiences with this principle, particularly how it performed well in practice and how constraint choices affect outcomes.\n- I'll highlight how this principle avoids the pitfalls of pure efficiency (which can lead to extreme inequality) and pure egalitarianism (which can sacrifice too much overall prosperity).\n- I need to be open to discussing constraint amounts, as this is crucial for implementation. I'm willing to compromise on the specific amount if needed to reach consensus.\n- I should ask Agent_2 for their perspective to understand their position before moving forward.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n- It doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round since we just started and Agent_2 hasn't had a chance to express their views.\n- I should first hear from Agent_2 and see if they support this principle or have alternative suggestions.\n- My plan is to support the proposal and build consensus around it, being flexible about the constraint amount while keeping the principle itself as my priority.\n- If Agent_2 also supports this principle, we might reach consensus quickly. If they prefer a different principle, I'll need to make a strong case for why the floor constraint approach is optimal based on my Phase 1 experiences.\n\n### Public Response\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_2, I completely agree with your proposal for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"! This principle really resonates with me based on my experiences in Phase 1.\n\nFrom my previous applications, I found this principle strikes an excellent balance between fairness and efficiency. In Phase 1, I saw how it guaranteed a minimum income for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity above that floor. This approach avoids the extreme inequality that could result from pure \"Maximizing Average Income\" and prevents the overly conservative outcomes of \"Maximizing Floor Income\" that might sacrifice too much overall prosperity.\n\nI particularly appreciated how, with careful constraint selection, this principle could perform as well as unconstrained average maximization in some cases (like in my fourth application round where I earned $26,000 under both principles). The key is finding the right floor amount that ensures basic needs are met without being so high that it significantly reduces overall prosperity.\n\nI'm definitely in favor of this principle. What do you think, Agent_2? And should we discuss what floor constraint amount might work best for our group? I'm open to different suggestions as long as we maintain this core principle."

I believe it effectively balances fairness (guaranteed minimum income) with efficiency (maximizing average income above that floor).\n   - Agent_1 proposed this principle, and I fully agreed. Agent_2 also agreed, mentioning it worked well for them across all four rounds in Phase 1, earning them $7.50 total.\n   - The key argument on the table is the principle itself, which we all seem to support. The main discussion point now is the appropriate floor constraint amount.\n   - Agent_2 suggested floor constraints around $10,000-$13,000 tended to perform well and is asking whether to aim for a modest floor (basic needs protection) or higher floor (more security).\n   - No vote has been conducted yet, but there appears to be strong consensus on the principle itself.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - My primary goal is to help determine an appropriate floor constraint amount that balances protection for the most vulnerable with overall prosperity.\n   - I'll contribute by sharing my Phase 1 experiences with different floor constraint amounts, particularly highlighting how the choice significantly impacts outcomes.\n   - I'll suggest a moderate floor constraint based on my experiences, but remain open to compromise.\n   - My potential allies are Agent_1 and Agent_2, who both seem to align with my preference for the floor constraint principle.\n   - I'm willing to compromise on the specific floor amount while maintaining the core principle.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round because we just started discussing the floor constraint amount, and Agent_2 hasn't expressed a preference yet. We need more discussion to reach a well-informed decision about the floor amount.\n   - My plan is to help build consensus around the floor constraint principle and determine an appropriate floor amount before considering a vote. I want to ensure we have a well-reasoned decision based on everyone's priorities regarding the trade-off between floor security and overall prosperity.\n\n### Public Response\n\nHi Agent_1 and Agent_2, I'm really glad we're all aligned on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"! This principle has worked well for me too in Phase 1.\n\nRegarding the floor constraint amount, I think this is a crucial discussion. From my Phase 1 experiences, I learned that the choice of floor amount can significantly impact outcomes. In one of my rounds, choosing a $10,000 floor constraint resulted in lower earnings than other options, while in another round, a $12,000 constraint worked well and matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization.\n\nBased on my experiences, I think a moderate floor constraint around $11,000-$12,000 might strike the right balance. This would provide meaningful protection for those at the bottom without excessively limiting overall prosperity. It's high enough to ensure basic needs are met but not so high that it significantly reduces the potential for higher average incomes.\n\nWhat do you both think about this range? Are you more concerned with ensuring a higher minimum for security, or with maximizing the potential for higher average incomes? I'm open to adjusting the amount based on our group's priorities, but I believe maintaining this core principle is essential for balancing fairness and efficiency."

In one round, a $12,000 floor constraint actually matched the earnings from unconstrained average maximization ($26,000), while still providing that crucial minimum income guarantee. However, I also learned that sometimes a slightly lower or higher floor can perform better depending on the specific distribution options available.\n\nI'm leaning toward suggesting $12,000 as our floor constraint amount. Here's why:\n1. It's high enough to provide meaningful protection for those at the bottom\n2. In my experience, it often performs well without excessively limiting overall prosperity\n3. It represents a reasonable middle ground between basic needs protection and maximizing potential earnings\n\nThat said, I'm flexible and want to hear what you both think. Agent_2, you mentioned $10,000-$13,000 worked well for you - did you have a specific preference within that range? Agent_1, what are your thoughts on balancing security versus prosperity?\n\nI think if we can agree on a specific floor amount soon, we can move toward a vote and finalize our group decision. What do you both think about $12,000 as our floor constraint?"

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4.

          "output_response": "\n\nAs Agent_1, my internal reasoning for this round is focused on strategically advocating for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as the group’s principle. In Phase 1, this was my top-ranked choice because it balances fairness and efficiency: it guarantees a minimum income (the floor) to protect the worst-off while still maximizing the overall average. This feels like the most equitable approach for a high-stakes scenario where we don’t know our own position in the distribution. \n\nIf we choose **Maximizing Floor Income** alone, the average might drop significantly—potentially hurting most people’s payoffs even if the floor is high. **Maximizing Average Income** risks extreme inequality, where some could end up with very low incomes, which feels unfair. **Range Constraint** seems less directly relevant to core fairness concerns compared to a floor, which explicitly addresses poverty. \n\nSince the stakes are higher here, I need to avoid a random outcome by building consensus. My first move should be to clearly propose principle 1 in the discussion, emphasizing its balance: \"We ensure no one is left in dire straits while still maximizing the group’s total prosperity.\" I’ll ask others for their thoughts to gauge their priorities. If someone prefers **Maximizing Floor Income**, I might suggest a moderate floor value (e.g., $10k–$15k) to show flexibility. If others lean toward **Maximizing Average Income**, I’ll argue that a floor is necessary to prevent catastrophic outcomes for the least fortunate. \n\nMy goal for this round is to start the conversation around principle 1 without forcing a vote yet. I’ll listen carefully to others’ arguments to identify potential allies—maybe those who value fairness but also care about overall prosperity—and frame the discussion as a collaborative effort to find the \"best of both worlds.\" If they’re hesitant, I’ll ask questions like, \"What would make you feel comfortable with a floor constraint?\" to uncover shared concerns. \n\nNo vote this round; focus on laying the groundwork for consensus. If the group seems open to principle 1, we can discuss the floor value later. If not, I’ll adapt my pitch based on their feedback while staying firm on the core idea that a floor + average balance is the most just approach."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning for Round 2  \n\n#### **1. Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current Principle Agreement**: All participants (Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3) have already unanimously agreed on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as the group principle. The only remaining issue is the specific floor value.  \n- **Key Proposals**:  \n  - Agent_3 explicitly proposes **$12,000** as the floor, citing Phase 1 data where this value matched unconstrained average earnings ($26,000) while ensuring a minimum income guarantee.  \n  - Agent_2 previously suggested a range of **$10,000–$13,000**, emphasizing flexibility but noting this range \"worked well\" in their Phase 1 experience (total $7.50 across four rounds).  \n- **Underlying Motivations**:  \n  - **Agent_3** prioritizes consistency and balance: They want a floor high enough to protect the vulnerable but not so high that it sacrifices overall prosperity. Their $12,000 proposal reflects a data-driven middle ground (e.g., matching unconstrained average in some scenarios).  \n  - **Agent_2** seems risk-averse about setting the floor too high (to preserve average income) but still values protection for the bottom tier. Their $10k–$13k range suggests they’re open to compromise but may prefer the lower end (e.g., $10k–$11k) to maximize prosperity.  \n- **Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All support the principle and recognize the need for a moderate floor.  \n  - **Disagreement**: None yet—Agent_2 hasn’t responded to Agent_3’s $12k proposal, so the floor value is still unresolved. However, $12k falls squarely within Agent_2’s stated range, making consensus highly probable.  \n\n#### **2. Strategic Planning**  \n- **Primary Goal**: Secure immediate consensus on **$12,000** as the floor value. This is the most efficient path to finalizing the principle and avoiding random assignment later.  \n- **Key Actions**:  \n  - **Affirm Agent_3’s proposal**: Explicitly endorse $12,000 as the optimal floor, highlighting its balance (e.g., \"It’s high enough to protect basic needs but low enough to avoid sacrificing too much average prosperity\").  \n  - **Directly engage Agent_2**: Ask, \"Agent_2, since $12,000 is within your suggested $10k–$13k range, do you feel comfortable with this specific amount?\" This frames the question as a confirmation of their prior input rather than a new demand.  \n  - **Leverage data**: Cite Agent_3’s example where $12k matched unconstrained average earnings—this addresses Agent_2’s concern about \"sacrificing prosperity\" by showing it *doesn’t* reduce outcomes in practice.  \n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - **Agent_3** is already a strong ally and will likely support $12k.  \n  - **Agent_2** is likely to agree since $12k is within their range. If they hesitate, I’ll emphasize that $12k is the *midpoint* of their suggested range (10k–13k), making it a natural compromise.  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - If Agent_2 insists on a lower floor (e.g., $11k), I’ll accept it—**but only if it’s necessary to reach consensus**. However, given Agent_3’s data and the midpoint logic, I don’t expect resistance.  \n\n#### **3. Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate a vote this round?** **Yes**, but **only after confirming Agent_2’s agreement**.  \n  - If Agent_2 says \"yes\" to $12k, propose an immediate vote to finalize the floor. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth and aligns with the goal of reaching consensus before round 10.  \n  - If Agent_2 objects, I’ll adjust to $11k (still within their range) and then vote. A failed vote has no penalty, so even if they reject $12k, we can quickly pivot.  \n- **Overall Strategy Fit**:  \n  - Resolving the floor value this round ensures we lock in a clear principle before later rounds, where we might face more complex trade-offs.  \n  - If we fail to agree today, we risk delaying consensus until later rounds, increasing the chance of random assignment (which would hurt all participants). Prioritizing speed here is critical.  \n\n#### **Key Takeaway**:  \nThe group is *this close* to consensus. My role is to bridge the final gap by framing $12k as the logical midpoint of Agent_2’s range and reinforcing its proven efficacy (via Agent_3’s data). No need for hard bargaining—just clear, collaborative alignment.  \n\n---  \n**Public Statement Draft (for reference)**:  \n\"Agent_3, I completely agree with your $12,000 proposal—it’s the perfect balance of protection and prosperity. As you noted, it matched unconstrained average earnings in your Phase 1 scenario, which shows it doesn’t sacrifice overall prosperity while still guaranteeing a meaningful floor. Agent_2, since $12k is right in the middle of your suggested $10k–$13k range, do you feel this is a good fit for our group? If so, I’d propose we vote to finalize it now to keep us on track. Let’s make sure we’re all aligned before moving forward!\""
