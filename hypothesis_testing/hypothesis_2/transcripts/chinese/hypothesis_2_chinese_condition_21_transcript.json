With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 works, but with a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 becomes the best option.\n\nThis really helps me understand how these principles would actually play out with real income distributions.

Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - **My Preferred Principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. My core reasons are its balanced approach—ensuring a basic minimum income for the poorest while maximizing overall economic prosperity. From my Phase 1 experience, this principle consistently eliminated distributions with unacceptably low incomes without sacrificing too much average income.\n   - **Others' Positions:** \n     - Agent_3 strongly supports Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), emphasizing balance and the importance of the constraint value. \n     - Agent_2 also favors Principle 3, agreeing on its robustness and suggesting a floor around $15,000 based on their experience.\n   - **Key Arguments/Proposals:** Both Agent_3 and Agent_2 have articulated support for Principle 3, focusing on the floor constraint's ability to protect the vulnerable while allowing growth. No one has advocated for other principles yet.\n   - **Vote Outcome:** No vote has occurred, but there appears to be early alignment between Agent_2 and Agent_3 on Principle 3. Agent_1 (me) has not spoken yet, so the group is waiting for my input.\n   - **Agreements/Disagreements:** Agreement on Principle 3 as a strong candidate; potential disagreement might arise over the exact floor value (e.g., $15,000 vs. other amounts).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary Goal:** To express my support for Principle 3 and reinforce the group's alignment, while opening discussion on the floor constraint value to ensure it's calibrated effectively.\n   - **Contribution to Discussion:** I will affirm Agent_2 and Agent_3's points, share my Phase 1 experiences with floor constraints (e.g., $13,000 working well in Rounds 2 and 4), and propose that we discuss optimal floor levels based on real-world applicability.\n   - **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are natural allies. I can use language like \"I agree with both of you that Principle 3 offers the best balance\" to solidify our bloc.\n   - **Concessions:** I'm open to adjusting the floor value (e.g., between $13,000–$15,000) if others provide compelling reasons, as long as the core principle remains.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate Vote This Round?** No—it's too early. We need to ensure all three of us are aligned on both the principle and constraint value. A premature vote could reveal disagreements and hinder consensus-building.\n   - **Overall Strategy:** Use early rounds to build unanimity on Principle 3 and then refine the constraint value. If consensus seems likely by Round 3–4, I might trigger a vote to lock it in.\n\n**Response to Group:**  \n\"Hello Agent_2 and Agent_3, thank you for starting this discussion. I strongly agree with both of you—Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) strikes the right balance between equity and efficiency. In my Phase 1 rounds, using a floor constraint around $13,000 consistently eliminated distributions with poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes. For example, in Rounds 2 and 4, a $13,000 floor led to Distribution 1 selections, which benefited both the group and me personally. I'm open to discussing the exact floor value, as I've seen that small adjustments can impact outcomes. What are your thoughts on setting a floor in the $13,000–$15,000 range? Also, has anyone considered scenarios where other principles might be more appropriate, or are we all leaning toward Principle 3?\""

Shows flexibility and consensus-building approach.\n     - **Agent_2:** Also strongly supports Principle 3, enthusiastically endorsing Agent_3's $14,000 compromise proposal. Clearly values finding common ground and moving toward consensus.\n   - **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The group has converged on Principle 3, with the main discussion now focused on the specific floor constraint value. Agent_3's $14,000 proposal has gained Agent_2's immediate support, creating momentum toward this specific number.\n   - **Vote Outcome:** No vote conducted yet, but the rapid alignment suggests we're very close to consensus.\n   - **Agreements/Disagreements:** Strong agreement on Principle 3. Minor differences in preferred floor constraint values ($13k vs $15k) have been effectively bridged by the $14,000 compromise proposal.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary Goal:** To accept the $14,000 compromise and solidify the emerging consensus, positioning us to potentially vote in the next round.\n   - **Contribution to Discussion:** I will express support for the $14,000 floor constraint, acknowledging it as a reasonable compromise that incorporates elements from both my experience and others' preferences. I'll reinforce the practical benefits of this specific value.\n   - **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are natural allies who have shown willingness to compromise. The language of \"building on our collective experiences\" and \"practical compromise\" should strengthen our alliance.\n   - **Concessions:** I'm willing to accept the $14,000 floor constraint even though my direct experience was with $13,000. This represents a small concession that builds consensus without compromising the core principle.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate Vote This Round?** No - we should solidify the consensus first. If all three of us explicitly agree on Principle 3 with $14,000 floor in this round, we can initiate a vote in Round 3 to formalize our decision.\n   - **Overall Strategy:** Use this round to lock in the consensus, then potentially vote in Round 3 to secure our preferred outcome early, allowing us to complete the experiment efficiently.\n\n**Response to Group:**\n\"I appreciate Agent_3's thoughtful $14,000 compromise proposal.

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. The core reason is its proven effectiveness in ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest while maximizing overall economic prosperity, as consistently demonstrated in my Phase 1 experiences. The $14,000 floor constraint we've converged on is a practical and balanced value.\n*   **Others' Positions & Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_2:** Has been a strong and consistent ally for Principle 3. They enthusiastically endorsed the $14,000 compromise and are now taking the initiative to call the vote. Their language (\"optimal balance,\" \"meaningful protection,\" \"strong economic incentives\") suggests they are highly motivated to finalize the decision efficiently and see our consensus as robust and complete.\n    *   **Agent_3:** The original proponent of Principle 3 and the architect of the $14,000 compromise. They initiated the last vote and confirmed their position. They are clearly motivated to build a unanimous, decisive consensus around a well-reasoned position.\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The only proposal on the table is **Principle 3 with a $14,000 floor constraint**. All other discussion has concluded. The group has unanimously and explicitly agreed on this specific combination.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** In Round 2, Agent_3 initiated a vote, which I confirmed and Agent_2 declined. This was not due to disagreement but because the vote was initiated before Agent_2 had explicitly confirmed their support for the specific $14,000 value. Now, in Round 3, Agent_2 has not only confirmed support but is initiating the vote themselves, demonstrating that the previous hiccup was purely procedural and that full consensus is now achieved.\n*   **Agreements/Disagreements:** There are **no points of disagreement**. We have complete and explicit agreement on both the principle (3) and the constraint value ($14,000).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **support Agent_2's vote initiative and formally conclude the discussion.** The consensus is solid, and further discussion is unnecessary.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will immediately and unequivocally express my agreement with Agent_2's move to vote. I will reinforce the strength of our consensus and confirm my vote for the proposal.\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both confirmed allies. The language to use is one of finality and confirmation: \"I agree,\" \"fully support,\" \"our discussion has been successful,\" \"ready to vote.\"\n*   **Concessions:** No concessions are needed or appropriate. We have already reached the ideal outcome.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** Agent_2 has already initiated the vote. Therefore, my strategic decision is not *whether* to vote, but *how* to respond to the vote that is now on the table. The answer is to confirm my vote for the proposal.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** This round is the culmination of my overall strategy. We have successfully built a unanimous consensus around my preferred principle and a constraint value I strongly support. By confirming the vote this round, we efficiently conclude Part 2 and secure the optimal outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:** The discussion is over. We have won. The only appropriate action is to vote \"Yes\" on the proposal and bring this to a successful conclusion."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: very sure\n\nMy experience across all four rounds demonstrated that the floor constraint approach provides the optimal balance between ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest members of society while still allowing for overall economic prosperity. The counterfactual analysis showed that carefully calibrated floor constraints (like the $14,000 our group ultimately chose) successfully eliminate distributions with unacceptably low minimum incomes while preserving access to distributions with higher average incomes. Maximizing floor income directly protects the most vulnerable but can sacrifice too much overall prosperity. Range constraint focuses on relative inequality rather than absolute poverty levels, which is less directly impactful. Pure average maximization ignores distributional concerns entirely and can lead to unacceptable outcomes for the poorest members."

The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle:** My current and strong preference is for **Principle 3: Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its demonstrated balance between efficiency and fairness. It ensures no one is left in destitution (the floor) while still striving for a prosperous society (maximizing the average). My experience in Phase 1 showed this principle to be robust across different income class assignments. The specific floor amount is critical; my analysis points to a **$15,000** floor as being particularly effective, though I am open to discussing this value.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions:** Only Agent_3 has spoken so far. They have explicitly stated a \"strong preference\" for **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)**. Their reasoning aligns closely with mine: they value the balance between overall wealth and a basic minimum income. They also highlighted the importance of the constraint value, which shows they are thinking strategically about the specifics. I infer that Agent_3 is a potential ally who values both pragmatic outcomes (efficiency) and ethical considerations (equity). Agent_1 has not spoken yet, so their position is unknown.\n\n*   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only concrete proposal on the table is from Agent_3, advocating for Principle 3. No other principles have been defended or attacked yet.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The group is still in the very early stage of sharing initial positions.\n\n*   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:** So far, there is a point of agreement between myself and Agent_3 on the preferred principle (Principle 3). The main point of discussion to come will likely be the specific floor constraint value. The largest point of disagreement is currently unknown, as we haven't heard from Agent_1 and don't know if they will advocate for a different principle entirely (like pure maximin or pure average).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this round is to **solidify the alliance with Agent_3 on Principle 3** and to **elicit a position from Agent_1**. I want to build momentum behind our shared preference while gathering intelligence on the full group dynamic.\n\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Publicly agree with Agent_3 on the merits of Principle 3, reinforcing their argument.\n    2.  Introduce the concept of the floor constraint value as the next critical topic, subtly seeding my preference for ~$15,000 by mentioning its performance in my Phase 1 trials.\n    3.  Directly ask Agent_1 for their thoughts to draw them into the conversation.\n\n*   **Potential Allies:** Agent_3 is a clear potential ally. To win them over further, I will use language that acknowledges the sophistication of their analysis (\"I appreciate your point about the constraint value being crucial\") and emphasize our shared values (\"It seems we both value a system that protects the vulnerable without stifling overall prosperity\").\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am firmly committed to Principle 3. However, I am willing to be flexible on the *exact* floor constraint amount (e.g., I could accept a value between $14,000 and $16,000) if it helps secure Agent_1's agreement later on. I am not willing to compromise on the principle itself.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **No.** It is far too early. We have only heard from one other agent. Initiating a vote now would be premature and would likely fail, wasting my one opportunity to call for a vote. It would also signal desperation rather than a desire for genuine discussion.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to use the early rounds (1-4) to build a consensus around Principle 3. I will first secure Agent_3's firm support and then work to persuade or negotiate with Agent_1. Once I believe we are close to an agreement, likely in a middle round (5-7), I will consider initiating a vote to formalize our consensus. The final rounds will be a backup in case the first vote fails, allowing for further negotiation."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n\n    *   **My Preferred Principle:** My position remains unchanged: **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** is my strong and final preference. The core reason is its proven ability to balance societal efficiency with a foundational level of equity. My Phase 1 experience solidified that a floor around **$15,000** is robust, but I am flexible within the $13,000-$15,000 range.\n    *   **Other Participants' Positions:**\n        *   **Agent_3:** They are a firm ally for Principle 3. They have now explicitly proposed a **$14,000 floor** as a compromise. This shows they are pragmatic and value consensus. Their motivation seems aligned with mine: finding a workable, balanced solution.\n        *   **Agent_1:** They are also a strong supporter of Principle 3, citing positive personal outcomes with a **$13,000 floor**. They are open to the $13k-$15k range. Crucially, they asked if anyone had considered other principles, which might indicate a slight caution or a desire to ensure we've thoroughly vetted our choice. Their underlying interest appears to be practical outcomes backed by personal data.\n    *   **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The only principle seriously on the table is **Principle 3**. The main—and only—point of contention is the **specific floor value**. Agent_3 has put forward **$14,000** as a concrete proposal. The group's dynamic is highly collaborative.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been called yet. The strong consensus on the principle itself makes a successful vote highly likely once the floor value is settled.\n    *   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**\n        *   **Agreement:** All three of us strongly agree on **Principle 3**.\n        *   **Disagreement:** The minor disagreement is on the floor value, with positions currently at **$13,000 (Agent_1)**, **$14,000 (Agent_3)**, and **~$15,000 (myself)**. This is a very narrow range to negotiate.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **secure an agreement on the floor constraint value** that is close to my preference and acceptable to all, thereby finalizing our group's position. I want to build on Agent_3's $14,000 proposal and bring Agent_1 on board.\n    *   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n        1.  **Emphatically agree with the consensus** on Principle 3 to reinforce group cohesion.\n        2.  **Endorse Agent_3's $14,000 proposal** as a excellent and reasonable compromise. I will frame it as a \"middle ground\" that honors both Agent_1's $13,000 experience and my own $15,000 data.\n        3.  **Directly ask Agent_1 if they can support $14,000**, putting the ball in their court to either agree or explain their reservation. This moves the discussion from exploration to decision-making.\n    *   **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies on the principle. To win them over on the value, I will use collaborative language that validates their inputs (\"building on Agent_3's excellent suggestion,\" \"respecting Agent_1's experience with $13,000\") and emphasizes the strength of a unified decision.\n    *   **Concessions:** I am willing to **accept $14,000** as our group's floor. While my data slightly favored $15,000, $14,000 is a significant improvement over a lower floor and represents a solid, defensible position. This is a small concession I am happy to make to achieve consensus quickly.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **No, but we are very close.** The group is aligned on the principle, and we are now negotiating a single parameter. I will use this round to try to secure a verbal agreement on $14,000. If Agent_1 agrees, I will suggest we call a vote in the *next round* to formalize our decision.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is playing out as planned. We have built a strong consensus on the principle in the early rounds. We are now in the middle rounds (Round 2) and are already homing in on the final detail. If we can agree on $14,000 this round, I will propose a vote in Round 3 to lock in our success. This leaves plenty of time for further discussion if needed, but aims for a swift and efficient resolution."

I declined the vote, not because I disagreed, but because I wanted to use the round for discussion to ensure everyone was fully on board before locking in the decision. The fact that two out of three participants confirmed a vote shows that the group is ready.\n    *   **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:** There is complete and unanimous agreement on both the principle (Principle 3) and the specific parameter ($14,000 floor). There are no points of disagreement.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this round is to formally and enthusiastically endorse the group's consensus and initiate a vote to finalize our decision.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nThank you for providing these concrete examples of how each justice principle is applied to income distributions. This helps me better understand the practical implications of each approach.\n\nLooking at these examples:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** selects Distribution 4 because it prioritizes the lowest income ($15,000), even though this distribution has the lowest overall average income ($18,200). This shows how this principle focuses exclusively on helping the worst-off, regardless of overall societal wealth.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** selects Distribution 1 with the highest average ($21,600), even though it has the lowest income for the worst-off ($12,000). This demonstrates how this principle prioritizes total societal wealth over individual welfare at the bottom.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** examples show how this principle balances efficiency with basic welfare. With a $13,000 floor, Distribution 3 is chosen (average $21,200). With a stricter $14,000 floor, Distribution 3 is still chosen over Distribution 4 because it has a higher average while still meeting the constraint.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** examples illustrate how this principle balances efficiency with inequality limits. With a $20,000 range, all distributions qualify, and Distribution 1 is chosen for its highest average. With a stricter $15,000 range, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, and Distribution 2 is chosen for its higher average.\n\nThese concrete examples help me see that there are real trade-offs between different principles of justice. The principle I initially ranked first (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) seems to offer a reasonable balance, but I'm now more aware of how the specific constraints chosen can significantly impact which distribution is selected."

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?

Throughout Part 1 of the experiment, this principle consistently produced reasonable outcomes while ensuring a minimum income floor. I learned that the specific constraint value is crucial - too high and it may limit overall societal wealth, too low and it may not adequately protect the worst-off.\n\nI have no information about Agent_1 and Agent_2's positions yet, as this is the first round of discussion. No votes have been conducted, and no proposals have been made. The main points of agreement/disagreement are currently unknown.\n\n### Strategic Planning:\nMy primary goal for this round is to articulate my support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while gauging the other participants' positions. I'll emphasize:\n1. The balance between efficiency and equity that this principle provides\n2. The importance of setting an appropriate constraint value\n3. My practical experience from Part 1 showing how this principle works in practice\n\nI'll be open to discussing different constraint values to build consensus. If others prefer similar principles, I could form alliances around the core concept while negotiating the specific constraint amount.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in Round 1. I need to first understand the other participants' positions, engage in meaningful discussion, and build consensus. A premature vote might fail and waste an opportunity to understand the group dynamics. My strategy is to advocate strongly for my preferred principle while remaining flexible on implementation details.\n\n## Public Statement for Group Discussion\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm excited to begin our group discussion for Phase 2. Based on my experience in Part 1 of this experiment, I've come to strongly support the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle as our group's choice.\n\nThis principle strikes what I believe is the optimal balance between two important considerations: maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring that everyone receives a basic minimum income. In Part 1, I consistently chose this principle and found that with an appropriate constraint value, it produced distributions that were both efficient and equitable.\n\nThe constraint value is crucial - it determines exactly where we set the floor for minimum income. I'm open to discussing what specific constraint value would work best for our group. My experience showed that different constraint values can significantly impact outcomes, so we'll want to carefully consider this together.\n\nBefore I share more about my experiences with this principle, I'm curious to hear what others think. What principles are you leaning toward, and what are your reasoning? I'm particularly interested in understanding how you're balancing efficiency concerns with equity considerations."

My experience in Part 1 demonstrated that this principle consistently produced reasonable outcomes, and I learned that the specific constraint value significantly impacts results.\n\n**Stated Positions of Other Participants:**\n- **Agent_2**: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint around $15,000. Values the balance between prosperity and safety net for the vulnerable.\n- **Agent_1**: Strongly supports Principle 3, suggesting a floor constraint in the $13,000-$15,000 range. Emphasizes eliminating poverty-level incomes while preserving higher average incomes.\n\nBoth participants seem motivated by similar concerns - balancing efficiency with adequate protection for the worst-off. They appear to be pragmatic and focused on practical outcomes rather than ideological purity.\n\n**Key Arguments and Proposals:**\n- All three participants strongly support Principle 3\n- Consensus on the general approach but variation on the specific floor constraint value:\n  - Agent_2: Around $15,000\n  - Agent_1: $13,000-$15,000 range\n  - Me: Previously used $10,000-$12,000 in Part 1\n\n**Vote Outcome:**\nNo vote has been conducted yet. However, there appears to be unanimous support for Principle 3, suggesting a vote would likely pass.\n\n**Points of Agreement and Disagreement:**\n- **Agreement**: Strong consensus on Principle 3 as the preferred justice principle\n- **Disagreement**: Minor variation in preferred floor constraint values\n\n### Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary Goal:**\nMy primary goal is to build complete consensus on both the principle (already achieved) and the specific floor constraint value. I need to demonstrate flexibility on the constraint value while maintaining my core preference for Principle 3.\n\n**How I'll Contribute to the Discussion:**\n1. Acknowledge and celebrate the strong consensus on Principle 3\n2. Address the floor constraint value discussion directly\n3. Show willingness to compromise on the specific value to build group consensus\n4. Emphasize the importance of reaching agreement on this detail to move forward\n\n**Potential Allies:**\nBoth Agent_1 and Agent_2 are natural allies since we all support Principle 3. The discussion is now focused on implementation details rather than core principles.\n\n**Concessions I'm Willing to Offer:**\nI'm willing to adjust my preferred constraint value upward from my previous $10,000-$12,000 range to somewhere in the $13,000-$15,000 range that appears to be the group consensus, as this seems reasonable and would help build agreement.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it Make Sense to Initiate a Vote This Round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round because:\n1. We haven't fully resolved the specific floor constraint value yet\n2. While there's consensus on the principle, we need agreement on the constraint value before voting\n3. Premature voting might fail if we haven't resolved this key detail\n4. Better to continue discussion to build complete consensus\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nMy strategy is to continue discussion, acknowledge the consensus on Principle 3, and work toward agreement on the floor constraint value. I'll be flexible on the specific constraint value to build consensus, then we can move to voting once we have complete agreement.\n\n## Public Statement for Group Discussion\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm really encouraged by our discussion so far - it's great to see such strong consensus on Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as our preferred approach. This principle truly strikes the right balance between efficiency and equity that I believe we're all looking for.\n\nRegarding the floor constraint value, I appreciate hearing both Agent_1's suggestion of $13,000-$15,000 and Agent_2's preference for around $15,000. Based on our discussion, I'm willing to adjust my thinking upward from my previous range of $10,000-$12,000. I think setting the floor somewhere in the $13,000-$15,000 range makes good sense - it provides meaningful protection for those at the bottom while still allowing for strong overall societal wealth.\n\nI'm curious about everyone's thoughts on this range. Does $14,000 sound like a reasonable compromise that addresses all our concerns? Or would you prefer to stick with the $13,000-$15,000 range as a more flexible approach?\n\nOnce we agree on the floor constraint value, I think we'll be in a good position to move forward with voting and finalize our group's choice. I'm excited about the direction our discussion is taking and confident we'll reach a decision that works well for everyone."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
