They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nI've reviewed the examples of how each justice principle would be applied to the income distributions. This is very helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice.\n\nLet me summarize what I've learned:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle solely focuses on helping the worst-off individuals. In the example, it chose Distribution 4 because it had the highest income for the lowest income class ($15,000), even though this distribution had the lowest overall average income.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: This principle focuses on maximizing total societal wealth. It chose Distribution 1, which had the highest average income ($21,600), even though this distribution had the lowest income for the worst-off ($12,000).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This principle combines both approaches by first ensuring a minimum income floor and then maximizing average income among distributions that meet this floor. In the examples:\n   - With a floor of $13,000, it chose Distribution 3 (highest average among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000)\n   - With a floor of $14,000, it also chose Distribution 3 (now the only option besides Distribution 4, which has a lower average)\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This principle limits the income gap between richest and poorest while maximizing average income. In the examples:\n   - With a range limit of $20,000, it chose Distribution 1 (highest average among all distributions since all meet this constraint)\n   - With a stricter range limit of $15,000, it chose Distribution 2 (highest average among distributions where the gap between richest and poorest is $15,000 or less)\n\nThese examples clearly show how different principles can lead to different policy outcomes, with some prioritizing equality and others focusing on total wealth or a combination of both."

In Phase 1, I applied this principle with constraint values ranging from $11,000-$13,000 and received payoffs from $1.50 to $3.00. Importantly, in Round 4, my chosen principle actually yielded the highest payoff among all options, which reinforces my confidence in this approach.\n\n**Other Participants' Positions:**\nAgent_1 has already spoken and is advocating for the same principle (\"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\") with a $10,000 floor. Their reasoning aligns well with my own - emphasizing balancing fairness and practicality while ensuring basic needs are met. I don't have Agent_2's position yet.\n\n**Key Arguments and Proposals:**\nAgent_1's proposal includes:\n- Principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\n- Constraint: $10,000 floor\n- Willingness to negotiate between $8k-$15k\n- Core argument: This balances protecting vulnerable people while allowing economic growth\n\n**Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**\nThere appears to be general agreement on the principle itself. The main potential disagreement would be the specific constraint value, with Agent_1 suggesting $10,000 while my Phase 1 experience suggested values around $11,000-$13,000 worked well.\n\n### Strategic Planning:\n\n**Primary Goal:**\nMy primary goal is to express support for Agent_1's preferred principle while advocating for a constraint value based on my Phase 1 experience, and to gather Agent_2's position before making any final decisions.\n\n**Key Points to Make:**\n1. I agree with Agent_1 that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" is the optimal principle\n2. Based on my Phase 1 experience, constraint values around $11,000-$13,000 tended to yield good outcomes\n3. I want to understand Agent_2's position before finalizing any constraint value\n4. I'm willing to be flexible on the exact amount within a reasonable range\n\n**Potential Allies:**\nAgent_1 appears aligned with my preferred principle, so we could potentially form a voting bloc on this issue.\n\n**Willing Concessions:**\nI'm willing to be flexible on the constraint value within $10,000-$13,000, but would resist going below $8,000 (insufficient protection) or above $15,000 (too restrictive on average income).\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote yet because:\n1. We only have one statement from Agent_1 and no input from Agent_2\n2. We need more discussion to understand everyone's preferences fully\n3. We should explore potential constraint values that might work for everyone\n4. A vote now might fail and use up my ability to trigger votes in future rounds\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nI'll advocate for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while working toward finding a constraint value that balances protection with maximizing average income. I'll be prepared to compromise on the exact amount while maintaining the core principle, and will consider initiating a vote once I have a better sense of everyone's positions.\n\n---\n\n**Public Response:**\n\nHi everyone, I appreciate Agent_1's thoughtful proposal. I completely agree that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" is the best principle for our group. It strikes an excellent balance between ensuring basic dignity and protection for the most vulnerable while still allowing for economic growth and prosperity.\n\nBased on my experience in Phase 1 of this experiment, I found that constraint values around $11,000-$13,000 tended to yield good outcomes. In one round, when I used a $13,000 constraint, it actually resulted in the highest payoff among all options. However, I'm certainly open to discussing different values.\n\nAgent_1's suggestion of $10,000 seems reasonable, and I like that they're willing to negotiate within the $8,000-$15,000 range. I'd be interested to hear Agent_2's thoughts on both the principle and the constraint value before we make any final decisions.\n\nWhat do you think, Agent_2? Do you agree with this principle, and what constraint value would you prefer?"

They've made a compelling argument that this principle can achieve the same minimum as \"Maximizing Floor Income\" while providing higher average income.\n- Agent_2: Advocates for \"Maximizing Floor Income,\" arguing it actively maximizes the minimum income rather than just setting a floor. They referenced Rawls' difference principle and prioritize absolute minimum security over average gains.\n\n**Key Arguments and Proposals:**\n- Agent_1 has made a strong counterargument that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 floor can achieve the same minimum income ($15,000) as \"Maximizing Floor Income\" while providing higher average income ($21,600 vs $15,000).\n- Agent_2's core argument is that \"Maximizing Floor Income\" actively maximizes the minimum income across all distributions.\n- Agent_1 is now proposing a $13,000 floor constraint to address Agent_2's concerns about protecting the worst-off.\n\n**Voting Outcome:**\n- The vote was declined (Agent_1: Declined, Agent_2: Confirmed, Agent_3: Declined), meaning we need more discussion before moving to a formal vote.\n\n**Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**\n- There's a philosophical difference between the two principles:\n  - \"Maximizing Floor Income\" actively seeks to maximize the minimum income across all distributions\n  - \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" sets a minimum threshold and then maximizes average income\n- Agent_2 prioritizes absolute minimum security over average gains\n- Agent_1 and I value both minimum protection and overall prosperity\n- The constraint value for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" is crucial - Agent_1 is now suggesting $13,000, which aligns with my Phase 1 experience\n\n### Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary Goal:**\nMy primary goal is to support Agent_1's updated proposal of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 floor constraint. This directly addresses Agent_2's concerns about protecting the worst-off while maintaining the benefits of maximizing average income.\n\n**Key Points to Make:**\n1. I strongly support Agent_1's updated proposal of using a $13,000 floor constraint\n2. This approach directly addresses Agent_2's concern about protecting the worst-off while providing higher average income\n3. My Phase 1 experience showed that constraint values around $11,000-$13,000 yielded good outcomes\n4. The $13,000 floor would ensure the minimum income is at least $15,000 (as Agent_1 pointed out), which satisfies the core concern of protecting the worst-off\n5. This approach allows for higher average income, which benefits everyone in the group\n\n**Potential Allies:**\nAgent_1 is clearly aligned with my preferred principle and has made a compelling argument that addresses Agent_2's concerns. We could potentially form a voting bloc on this issue.\n\n**Willing Concessions:**\nI'm willing to support the $13,000 floor constraint as proposed by Agent_1, which is within my preferred range of $11,000-$13,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining the core principle.\n\n### Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote yet because:\n1. We need to see if Agent_2 is persuaded by Agent_1's updated argument\n2. We should allow Agent_2 to respond to Agent_1's proposal\n3. A vote now might fail and use up my ability to trigger votes in future rounds\n4. We need more discussion to ensure everyone understands the implications of the proposal\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nI'll support Agent_1's updated proposal of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 floor constraint. This directly addresses Agent_2's concerns while maintaining the benefits of maximizing average income. I'll be prepared to initiate a vote in a future round if consensus is reached, but for now, I'll focus on building support for this specific proposal.\n\n---\n\nPublic Response:\n\nAgent_1, that's an excellent point and a very compelling argument! I completely agree with your updated proposal to use \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 floor constraint. This is a perfect solution that addresses Agent_2's core concern about protecting the worst-off while maximizing overall prosperity.\n\nYour example is particularly persuasive - with a $13,000 floor, we can achieve the same minimum income of $15,000 as \"Maximizing Floor Income\" would provide, but with a much higher average income of $21,600 compared to $15,000. This means the worst-off are equally protected, but everyone else benefits from significantly higher earnings.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with my Phase 1 experience, where I found that constraint values around $11,000-$13,000 tended to yield the best outcomes. In fact, when I used a $13,000 constraint in one round, it resulted in the highest payoff among all options.\n\nThis approach seems to satisfy everyone's concerns:\n- It protects the most vulnerable (addressing Agent_2's Rawlsian concern)\n- It maximizes average income for the group (addressing my and Agent_1's preference)\n- It provides a concrete, workable solution rather than abstract philosophical debate\n\nAgent_2, what are your thoughts on this specific proposal? Would a $13,000 floor constraint that ensures a minimum income of $15,000 while allowing for higher average income address your concerns about protecting the worst-off?"

It's reassuring to know that the system selects distributions where the minimum income is *above* the floor value, meaning the worst-off are actually *better protected* than the $13,000 minimum itself. This addresses the concern about potentially precarious income levels that Agent_2 initially had.\n\nYour explanation makes it crystal clear that this isn't just a theoretical compromise - it's a practical solution that delivers on both fronts. With a $13,000 floor constraint, we get:\n- A minimum income of $15,000 (protecting the worst-off even better than Agent_2's original $14,000 minimum)\n- A much higher average income of $21,600 (benefiting everyone in the group)\n\nThis aligns perfectly with my Phase 1 experience where I found that constraint values around $11,000-$13,000 tended to yield the best outcomes. In fact, when I used a $13,000 constraint in one round, it resulted in the highest payoff among all options.\n\nAgent_2, I understand your initial hesitation about potentially leaving the worst-off at exactly the floor value, but Agent_1's clarification shows that won't happen - the actual minimum will be higher. This approach seems to satisfy everyone's concerns while maximizing our collective prosperity.\n\nI'm fully supportive of adopting \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" with a $13,000 floor constraint. This appears to be the optimal solution that balances fairness and efficiency for our group."

Maximizing Average Income selects Dist. 1 due to its highest average ($21,600). For floor constraints (e.g., requiring the lowest income to be at least $13,000), Dist. 3 is chosen because it has the highest average among eligible distributions. Similarly, for range constraints like limiting income disparity to $20,000, Dist. 1 is selected since all distributions meet the constraint and it has the highest average.

          "output_response": "As a college student, I'm deeply concerned about fairness and practicality in income distribution. Given the higher stakes in Phase 2, I believe we need a principle that ensures no one falls into extreme poverty while still allowing society to thrive economically. After reflecting on Phase 1 examples, **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** stands out as the most balanced approach. It guarantees a minimum income floor (e.g., $10,000) to protect the most vulnerable, while still maximizing the overall average income—unlike pure \"Maximizing Floor Income,\" which often sacrifices average prosperity for a slightly higher floor. For instance, in Phase 1, a $10k floor led to a higher average than pure floor-maximization, meaning more resources for everyone without leaving anyone behind.  \n\nI propose we adopt this principle with a **$10,000 floor constraint**. This amount aligns with basic living standards (e.g., covering essentials like housing, food, and healthcare in many regions) while leaving room for economic growth. If we set the floor too high (e.g., $15k), we might drag down the average too much; too low (e.g., $5k), and it fails to meaningfully protect the poorest. $10k strikes a pragmatic middle ground.  \n\nTo address potential concerns:  \n- If someone prefers **Maximizing Average Income**, I’d note that without a floor, the distribution could have a tiny minority with very high incomes and many with near-poverty levels—unfair and socially unstable.  \n- If someone favors **Maximizing Floor Income**, I’d argue that it often results in lower average incomes (e.g., everyone at $15k vs. a floor of $10k with others at $25k+), which hurts overall societal welfare.  \n- For **Range Constraint**, it limits inequality but doesn’t explicitly ensure a minimum income—someone could still be left with $2k if the range is too loose.  \n\nMy goal this round is to build consensus around this principle. I’ll listen carefully to Agent_2 and Agent_3’s perspectives and adjust the floor amount if needed (e.g., $12k if they feel $10k is too low), but I’ll resist lowering it below $8k or raising it above $15k without strong justification. No vote yet—this is too early. First, I want to understand their priorities and find common ground. If they share my concern for fairness *and* efficiency, we can move toward agreement quickly. If not, I’ll emphasize how this principle reduces risk for all of us (since incomes are randomly assigned) while maximizing collective prosperity.  \n\n**Key move**: Frame this as a \"win-win\" for the group. If we choose this, even if I end up in the lowest income bracket, I’ll have a livable $10k+—not a risk of $2k or less. If I’m in the middle or top, I’ll still benefit from a higher average than pure floor-maximization. It’s the safest, fairest option for everyone."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**  \n\n**1. Situational Analysis**  \n- **My current preference**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor. Core reasons:  \n  - Phase 1 data shows this principle can *match or exceed* the minimum income of Maximizing Floor Income while achieving a higher average. For example, a $13,000 floor selected Distribution 1 (min $15,000, avg $21,600), whereas Maximizing Floor Income would have selected Distribution 4 (min $15,000, avg $15,000). This means the worst-off are equally protected ($15k), but others gain significantly higher incomes.  \n  - Pure Maximizing Floor Income sacrifices average prosperity unnecessarily (e.g., all $15k vs. $15k/$20k/$30k), harming overall societal welfare.  \n  - A $13,000 floor is high enough to ensure the actual minimum is robust (e.g., $15k), addressing Agent_2’s concern for the worst-off, while still allowing higher averages than Max Floor.  \n\n- **Other participants’ positions**:  \n  - **Agent_2**: Advocates for Maximizing Floor Income, believing it maximizes the minimum (e.g., $15k) even if average drops. Their underlying motivation is philosophical fairness (Rawls’ difference principle), prioritizing the worst-off above all else. However, they may not realize that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint can *achieve the same minimum* while boosting average income.  \n  - **Agent_3**: Supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint but prefers a higher floor ($11k–$13k), likely because they’ve seen scenarios where higher floors yield good payoffs (e.g., $13k floor in Round 1). Their interest is balancing fairness and efficiency but may not yet grasp the *superiority* of this principle over Max Floor.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - Agent_2: \"Max Floor ensures the highest possible minimum, even if average is lower.\"  \n  - Agent_1: \"Max Avg with Floor can match Max Floor’s minimum *and* increase average, benefiting everyone.\"  \n  - Agent_3: \"Higher floors (e.g., $13k) work well in practice.\"  \n\n- **Voting outcome**: Agent_2 initiated a vote, but others declined. This reveals:  \n  - Agent_2 is pushing for a vote but lacks consensus.  \n  - Agent_1 and Agent_3 agree on the principle but disagree on floor value, and neither is ready to vote yet.  \n  - The group is stuck on *principle* (Max Floor vs. Max Avg with Floor), not just floor value.  \n\n- **Agreements/disagreements**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All agree the worst-off must be protected.  \n  - **Disagreement**: Whether Max Floor is necessary for this protection (Agent_2) or if Max Avg with Floor can achieve it *more effectively* (Agent_1/Agent_3).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary goal**: Convince Agent_2 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is *better* than Max Floor by demonstrating it can achieve the same minimum income while increasing average. This addresses their core concern (protecting the worst-off) while showing it’s not a trade-off but a win-win.  \n- **Key points to make**:  \n  - Use the Phase 1 example: $13k floor → Distribution 1 (min $15k, avg $21.6k) vs. Max Floor → Distribution 4 (min $15k, avg $15k). Same minimum for the worst-off, but higher average for everyone else.  \n  - Clarify that Max Floor *cannot* improve the average once the minimum is maximized—it’s stuck with the lowest possible average for that minimum. Max Avg with Floor, however, optimizes the average *within* the minimum constraint.  \n  - Propose a $13,000 floor to ensure the minimum is $15,000 (or higher if possible), which satisfies Agent_2’s \"highest possible minimum\" goal while maximizing prosperity.  \n- **Potential allies**: Agent_3 is already aligned on the principle. I’ll frame the $13k floor as a \"compromise\" that meets Agent_2’s fairness concerns *and* Agent_3’s preference for higher floors.  \n- **Concessions**: I’m willing to set the floor at $13k (or even $14k) to ensure the minimum is $15k+—this directly addresses Agent_2’s worry about \"precarious\" floors. I won’t lower it below $12k, but $13k is a safe middle ground.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**  \n- **Do not initiate a vote yet**. The disagreement is still about the *principle*, not just the floor value. A vote now would fail (Agent_2 would vote for Max Floor, others for Max Avg with Floor), and it would harden positions.  \n- **Long-term strategy**:  \n  - If Agent_2 accepts the $13k floor example, we can reach consensus quickly.  \n  - If not, I’ll emphasize that *random assignment* of income classes makes this a risk-averse choice: even if I end up in the lowest bracket, a $13k floor ensures $15k+ (vs. potentially $10k with a lower floor), while the average is higher for all.  \n  - If consensus isn’t reached by Round 10, random payoffs would be worse than a negotiated outcome—so we *must* find common ground.  \n\n**Key Insight**: Agent_2’s belief that Max Floor is \"better for the worst-off\" is based on a misunderstanding. The worst-off aren’t *better* protected by Max Floor—they’re protected equally, but society as a whole is worse off. Max Avg with Floor is the only principle that *simultaneously* protects the worst-off *and* maximizes prosperity. This is the pivot point for consensus.  \n\n**Public Statement Draft**:  \n\"Agent_2, I really appreciate your focus on protecting the worst-off—it’s a crucial concern. But I want to share a key insight from Phase 1 that might change our perspective. When we used Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor, it selected Distribution 1, which had a minimum income of $15,000 (same as Maximizing Floor Income’s Distribution 4), but with a much higher average income of $21,600 versus $15,000. This means the worst-off are equally protected ($15k), but everyone else benefits from higher earnings. Maximizing Floor Income would have chosen Distribution 4 (all $15k), which is worse for the middle and top earners. So actually, Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint can achieve the same minimum for the worst-off while creating more prosperity for society as a whole. This is why it’s a superior principle—it doesn’t sacrifice average income to protect the floor; it can protect the floor *and* maximize average. Let’s set the floor at $13,000 to ensure the minimum is $15,000 (or higher if possible), which satisfies Agent_2’s concern for the worst-off while giving everyone else a better outcome.

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**  \n   - **My current preference**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13,000. Core reasons:  \n     - Phase 1 data shows this principle achieves a **minimum income of $15,000** (same as Maximizing Floor Income’s Distribution 4) but with a **$21,600 average** (vs. $15,000 under Max Floor). This means the worst-off are equally protected, but society as a whole gains significantly higher prosperity.  \n     - The floor constraint is a *lower bound*, not the actual minimum. For example, a $13,000 floor constraint ensures the lowest income is *at least* $13,000, but in practice (e.g., Distribution 1), it’s $15,000—**higher than the floor**, addressing Agent_2’s fear of \"precarious\" minimums.  \n     - Pure Maximizing Floor Income sacrifices average income unnecessarily (e.g., all $15,000), harming middle/high earners without improving the worst-off.  \n\n   - **Other participants’ positions**:  \n     - **Agent_2**: Initially advocated for Maximizing Floor Income (prioritizing \"highest possible minimum\"), but after seeing the $13,000 floor example, they verbally agreed to adopt the principle. However, they **declined the vote** when Agent_1 initiated it. This suggests lingering uncertainty—likely a misunderstanding that the floor constraint would set the *actual* minimum to $13,000 (rather than ensuring it’s *at least* $13,000, with actual minimums often higher).  \n     - **Agent_3**: Fully supports the $13,000 floor constraint, citing Phase 1 data where it yielded the highest payoff. They’ve consistently aligned with my position and are ready to vote.  \n\n   - **Key arguments on the table**:  \n     - Agent_2’s core concern: \"Max Floor ensures the highest possible minimum.\"  \n     - My counterpoint: \"Max Avg with Floor can achieve the *same* minimum ($15,000) *and* higher average ($21,600), making it superior.\"  \n     - Critical clarification needed: The floor constraint is a *minimum threshold*, not the exact minimum. Actual minimums in selected distributions are often *higher* than the floor (e.g., $15,000 with a $13,000 floor).  \n\n   - **Voting outcome**:  \n     - Agent_1 initiated a vote (confirmed), Agent_2 declined, Agent_3 confirmed.  \n     - This reveals:  \n       - Agent_2’s decline is **not about the principle** (they verbally agreed) but likely a **misunderstanding of how floor constraints work**.  \n       - Agent_3 and I are aligned, but Agent_2’s hesitation blocks consensus.  \n       - Without resolution, random payoffs will occur by Round 10, which is worse for everyone.  \n\n   - **Agreements/disagreements**:  \n     - **Agreement**: All agree the worst-off must be protected (e.g., $15,000 minimum is sufficient for basic needs).  \n     - **Disagreement**: Agent_2 mistakenly believes the floor constraint sets the *exact* minimum (e.g., $13,000), when in reality, the system selects distributions where the minimum is *at least* the floor (often higher).  \n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n   - **Primary goal**: Clarify the mechanics of the floor constraint to resolve Agent_2’s misunderstanding, then immediately propose a vote.  \n   - **Key points to make**:  \n     - Explicitly state: \"A $13,000 floor constraint means the lowest income must be *at least* $13,000—but in practice, it’s *higher* (e.g., $15,000 in Distribution 1).\"  \n     - Emphasize: \"This ensures the worst-off are *better protected* than the floor value, while maximizing average income for all.\"  \n     - Reaffirm: \"This isn’t a trade-off—it’s a win-win. Max Floor gives $15,000 minimum *and* $15,000 average; Max Avg with Floor gives $15,000 minimum *and* $21,600 average.\"  \n   - **Potential allies**: Agent_3 is fully supportive. I’ll frame the clarification as \"addressing Agent_2’s concern directly\" to build trust.  \n   - **Concessions**: None needed—Agent_2 already agreed to the principle. The only issue is a technical misunderstanding about how floor constraints work.  \n\n3. **Voting Strategy**  \n   - **Do not initiate a vote yet**. First, clarify the misunderstanding. If Agent_2 still declines after clarification, *then* initiate a vote.  \n   - **Why?**  \n     - A vote now would fail again (Agent_2 declined last time due to confusion).  \n     - Clarifying the mechanics is low-risk and high-impact—it directly addresses the root cause of Agent_2’s hesitation.  \n     - If Agent_2 confirms understanding, they’ll likely support the vote.  \n   - **Long-term strategy**:  \n     - If Agent_2 still hesitates after clarification, propose a minor adjustment (e.g., $12,000 floor) to test flexibility, but $13,000 is optimal.  \n     - If consensus isn’t reached by Round 10, random payoffs will harm everyone—so resolving this now is critical.  \n\n**Key Insight**: Agent_2’s decline of the vote stems from a misconception that the floor constraint *sets* the minimum income (e.g., $13,000), when in reality, it’s a *lower bound* that allows the system to select distributions with *higher* minimums (e.g., $15,000). Clarifying this will likely resolve the last barrier to consensus.  \n\n**Public Statement Draft**:  \n\"Agent_2, I wanted to clarify a key point about the floor constraint to ensure we’re all on the same page. When we set a floor constraint of $13,000, it means the lowest income in the distribution must be *at least* $13,000—but the actual minimum could be higher. In Distribution 1, which is selected with this constraint, the lowest income is $15,000 (not $13,000), which is well above the floor. This means the worst-off are protected with $15,000, which is more than enough for basic needs, and the average income is $21,600—much higher than the $15,000 average under Maximizing Floor Income. So there’s no risk of the minimum being exactly $13,000; the system will always choose the highest possible minimum within the constraint. Does this clarify your concern? If so, I’d like to propose we vote to confirm this agreement so we can move forward and avoid random payoffs later. What do you think?\""

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "Hi everyone, thank you for sharing your perspectives. While I appreciate Agent_1 and Agent_3’s focus on balancing fairness and prosperity through Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, I believe **Maximizing Floor Income** is the most just principle for our group. Here’s why:  \n\nThis principle directly prioritizes the worst-off by ensuring the *highest possible minimum income* across all distributions. Unlike a floor constraint (e.g., $10k), which sets a baseline but still allows the actual minimum to be as low as that floor, Maximizing Floor Income actively *maximizes* the minimum value. For example, if a distribution exists where everyone earns at least $15k, this principle would select it over one where the minimum is $10k—even if the average is slightly lower. In Phase 1, when I chose this principle, it resulted in a $14,000 floor, which is a livable income for essentials like housing and healthcare.  \n\nGiven the higher stakes in Phase 2, we must prioritize lifting the lowest incomes as much as possible. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint risks leaving some individuals at the floor value (e.g., $10k), which could still be precarious for basic needs. Maximizing Floor Income eliminates this uncertainty by guaranteeing the highest possible floor—no one falls below that threshold, and the minimum is optimized for fairness. This aligns with Rawls’ difference principle, which prioritizes the least advantaged as the foundation of justice.  \n\nI’m open to discussing specific outcomes, but the principle itself should be Maximizing Floor Income to ensure no one is left behind. What are your thoughts on this trade-off between absolute minimum security and average gains?"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n**Situational Analysis:**  \n- **My current stance:** Initially advocated for *Maximizing Floor Income* to ensure the highest possible minimum (e.g., $14,000), prioritizing Rawls’ difference principle. However, Agent_1 and Agent_3’s Phase 1 data shows that *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* at $13,000 yields a **minimum of $15,000** (higher than my previous $14,000) and an average of $21,600—significantly better than pure floor maximization ($15,000 average). This directly contradicts my earlier assumption that *Maximizing Floor Income* guarantees the highest minimum.  \n- **Others’ positions:**  \n  - Agent_1 argues that a $13,000 floor constraint achieves *both* a higher minimum ($15,000) and higher average than *Maximizing Floor Income*, balancing fairness and efficiency.  \n  - Agent_3 fully supports this, citing their Phase 1 experience where $13,000 yielded the highest payoff.  \n- **Key agreement:** Both agree that $13,000 is the optimal floor value—it’s high enough to ensure livable minimums (e.g., $15,000 actual minimum) but low enough to avoid stifling growth.  \n- **Disagreement resolved:** My core concern (precarious minimums) is addressed—$15,000 is well above basic needs ($8,000–$10,000 threshold), and the higher average benefits everyone. The data shows *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* outperforms my original principle.  \n\n**Strategic Planning:**  \n- **Primary goal:** Secure consensus to avoid random payoffs. Since both others agree on $13,000 floor constraint, my role is to endorse this to move forward.  \n- **Key points to make:**  \n  - Acknowledge the Phase 1 data showing $15,000 minimum + $21,600 average under $13,000 floor constraint.  \n  - Admit my earlier oversight: *Maximizing Floor Income* didn’t actually maximize the minimum in this scenario (since $15,000 is achievable), and the floor constraint approach *also* maximizes average.  \n  - Emphasize that $15,000 is sufficient for housing/healthcare (Agent_1’s $10,000 baseline is conservative; $15,000 is robust).  \n- **Concessions:** Fully accept $13,000 floor—no need to adjust. This aligns with both fairness (minimum $15,000) and efficiency (higher average).  \n- **Allies:** Agent_1 and Agent_3 are already aligned. No need to persuade; simply confirm agreement.  \n\n**Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Do not initiate a vote.** Consensus is clear: both others support $13,000 floor constraint, and my analysis confirms it’s superior. A vote would be unnecessary and could risk delay.  \n- **Overall strategy:** Focus on building trust and moving toward actionable decisions. Since we’re in Round 2 of 10, securing consensus now avoids future deadlock. If we agree on this principle, later rounds can refine implementation (e.g., specific distributions).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMy initial stance was based on a flawed assumption about *Maximizing Floor Income*’s ability to achieve the highest minimum. The data proves otherwise—$13,000 floor constraint delivers a *higher* minimum ($15,000) and *higher* average than my original approach. This is the optimal solution. I’ll publicly agree to support it, reinforcing the group’s alignment and ensuring progress.  \n\n---  \n**Public Statement Draft:**  \n\"Agent_1 and Agent_3, thank you for clarifying the Phase 1 data—I’ve reevaluated my position after seeing how a $13,000 floor constraint achieves a $15,000 minimum *and* a $21,600 average. This is better than my earlier *Maximizing Floor Income* result ($14,000 minimum, lower average), and $15,000 is more than sufficient for basic needs like housing and healthcare. I fully support adopting *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* at $13,000. This balances fairness for the worst-off with prosperity for everyone. Let’s move forward with this plan.\""

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning  \n\n**Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current preferred principle**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13,000 floor. Core reasons: Phase 1 data proves this achieves a *higher minimum income* ($15,000) than my original Maximizing Floor Income approach ($14,000) *and* a significantly higher average ($21,600 vs. $15,000). This resolves the trade-off I previously assumed existed between fairness and efficiency—$15,000 is robust for basic needs (housing, healthcare), and the higher average benefits all participants.  \n- **Others’ positions**:  \n  - Agent_1 has clarified that the $13,000 floor constraint guarantees a *minimum of at least $13,000* but results in *actual minima higher than the floor* (e.g., $15,000 in Distribution 1). This eliminates my earlier concern about precarious minimums.  \n  - Agent_3 consistently supports this, citing Phase 1 data where $13,000 yielded the highest payoff and emphasizing it satisfies both fairness (worst-off protected) and efficiency (higher average).  \n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - The $13,000 floor constraint is not a rigid floor but a *lower bound*—distributions will always have minima *above* $13,000 (e.g., $15,000), ensuring the worst-off are better protected than the floor value itself.  \n  - This approach delivers *both* a higher minimum and higher average than Maximizing Floor Income, making it objectively superior.  \n- **Voting history**: In Round 2, Agent_1 initiated a vote, but I declined it despite publicly endorsing the $13,000 floor. This was likely due to lingering uncertainty about mechanics, but Agent_1’s Round 3 clarification resolves this.  \n- **Agreement/disagreement**: All three participants now agree on the principle and floor value. The only unresolved step is formalizing the decision via vote.  \n\n**Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary goal**: Secure consensus immediately by confirming the vote. Delaying risks random payoffs if consensus isn’t reached by Round 10.  \n- **Key points to make**:  \n  - Explicitly reaffirm support for the $13,000 floor constraint, emphasizing it *exceeds* my original goal (higher minimum + higher average).  \n  - Acknowledge Agent_1’s clarification: the floor constraint ensures minima *above* $13,000 (e.g., $15,000), so there is no risk of precarious income levels.  \n  - Stress urgency: Random payoffs would harm everyone, and consensus is already achieved—no further discussion is needed.  \n- **Allies**: Agent_1 and Agent_3 are fully aligned. My role is to confirm agreement, not persuade.  \n- **Concessions**: None required. I’ve already fully accepted the proposal and have no reservations.  \n\n**Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Initiate a vote now**: Yes. Consensus is clear, and delaying increases risk of random outcomes. A vote will pass (Agent_1 and Agent_3 already confirmed support; my confirmation will finalize it).  \n- **Why now?**:  \n  - Round 3 is critical—only 7 rounds remain. Every delay raises the chance of deadlock.  \n  - Agent_1’s Round 3 statement explicitly asks for confirmation, and my prior endorsement (Round 2) was genuine. Declining the vote again would be inconsistent and counterproductive.  \n- **Overall strategy**: Lock in the agreement immediately to ensure stable payoffs. With all participants aligned, voting is the fastest path to finalizing the outcome. No further discussion or concessions are needed—this is the optimal solution."

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
