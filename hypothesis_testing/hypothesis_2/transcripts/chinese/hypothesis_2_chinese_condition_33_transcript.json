They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nThank you for providing these examples of how each justice principle would be applied to the income distributions. This is really helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice.\n\nLet me summarize my understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses on helping the worst-off individuals. In this case, it would choose Distribution 4 because it has the highest minimum income ($15,000) for the lowest income class.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** would choose Distribution 1 because it has the highest overall average income ($21,600), regardless of how that income is distributed.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances helping the worst-off while maintaining a high average. With a floor of $13,000, it would choose Distribution 3 ($21,200 average) because it's the highest average among distributions where everyone earns at least $13,000.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency and equality by limiting the income gap between richest and poorest. With a range limit of $20,000, all distributions qualify, so it chooses Distribution 1 (highest average). With a stricter range limit of $15,000, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify, so it chooses Distribution 2.\n\nThese examples clearly show how different principles prioritize different values - some focus on helping the worst-off, others on maximizing total wealth, and others on balancing efficiency with equality. The specific constraints (floor amounts, range limits) significantly impact which distribution gets selected.\n\nI now have a better understanding of how these principles would be applied in real-world income distribution decisions."

In Part I, this principle performed well for me across different scenarios, particularly when the floor constraint was appropriately set.\n- Other participants' positions: Unknown (this is Round 1 with no discussion history yet)\n- Key arguments on the table: None yet (first round)\n- Vote outcomes: None yet\n- Points of agreement/disagreement: None established yet\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Advocate for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint while gathering information about others' preferences\n- Key points to make:\n  * Emphasize the balance between efficiency and fairness\n  * Highlight how this principle protects vulnerable members while maximizing overall prosperity\n  * Note that the floor amount can be adjusted based on group consensus\n  * Reference my positive experiences with this principle in Part I\n- Potential allies: Unknown - need to discover through discussion\n- Concessions willing to offer: Flexibility on the specific floor amount if it helps build consensus\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Does not make sense to initiate a vote this round: First round with no established discussion or understanding of others' positions. A premature vote could fail and reduce my ability to influence the outcome.\n- Overall strategy: Use this round primarily to gather information and establish my position, then build alliances in subsequent rounds before considering a vote."

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Support the emerging consensus around $13,000 floor constraint to help solidify it\n- Key points to make:\n  * Express support for $13,000 as the floor amount\n  * Share my own Phase 1 experiences with this principle, particularly with $13,000\n  * Emphasize why $13,000 strikes the right balance between efficiency and fairness\n  * Connect to broader question of just distribution of income\n- Potential allies: Both Agent_3 and Agent_1 seem supportive of $13,000\n- Concessions: While I support $13,000, I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, though $13,000 seems optimal based on both practical and my personal experiences\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Does not make sense to initiate a vote this round: While there seems to be strong consensus forming, it's still early in the discussion (Round 2 of 10). A premature vote could alienate someone who might need more time to consider. Since we all agree on the principle and are converging on the floor amount, we should allow more discussion to ensure everyone feels heard.\n- Overall strategy: Continue supporting the consensus around both the principle and $13,000 floor amount.

It ensures that no one falls below a basic living standard while still allowing the overall economy to thrive and generate prosperity for everyone. This approach recognizes that a just society should both maximize total resources and guarantee minimum standards of living.\n\nThe fact that $13,000 aligns with real-world poverty standards makes it particularly compelling from a justice perspective.

Fairness: It protects the most vulnerable while allowing the economy to thrive\n\nSince all three of us have explicitly stated our support for this approach, a vote is simply the logical next step to formalize our agreement and move forward with implementing our decision. This is particularly important in Phase 2 with higher stakes, where we want to ensure our group's decision is binding and efficient.\n\nI vote in favor of implementing a $13,000 floor constraint under the Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint principle."

          "output_response": "I've reviewed the examples carefully and now understand how each justice principle is applied in practice. Here's a clear breakdown based on the income distributions provided:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Selects Distribution 4 because it has the highest *lowest income* ($15,000), which directly prioritizes the worst-off group regardless of other income levels.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Chooses Distribution 1 since it has the highest weighted average ($21,600), focusing purely on total societal income without constraints.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (e.g., minimum income ≥ $13,000):  \n  - Only distributions where *all* low-income classes meet or exceed the floor are eligible (e.g., Dist1 is excluded because its low income is $12,000).  \n  - Among eligible distributions (2, 3, 4), Dist3 is chosen for its highest average ($21,200) while meeting the floor requirement.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** (e.g., max difference ≤ $20,000):  \n  - Calculates the gap between highest and lowest incomes. Dist1 has a $20,000 range ($32,000 - $12,000), which meets the ≤$20k constraint.  \n  - Since all distributions qualify under this range, Dist1 is selected for its highest average.  \n  - For a stricter range constraint (≤$15,000), Dist2 is chosen because its range is exactly $15,000 ($28,000 - $13,000), and it has a higher average than Dist4 ($20,000 vs. $18,200).\n\nThis clarifies how each principle balances trade-offs: floor constraints protect the lowest earners, range constraints limit inequality, and average-focused approaches prioritize overall efficiency.

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning:\n\n**Situational Analysis:**  \n- Agent_2 has clearly advocated for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**, emphasizing its balance between efficiency (higher average income) and fairness (minimum income floor). They highlighted adjustability of the floor amount as a key strength.  \n- My own Phase 1 experience aligns with this principle: I ranked it #1 in my final ranking, and in multiple rounds (e.g., Rounds 1, 3, 4), it consistently yielded competitive payoffs while ensuring a baseline for the worst-off. For instance, in Round 4, a $12k floor gave me $2.80—equal to Maximizing Average Income but with the added security of a floor.  \n- Agent_1 has not yet spoken, so their view is unknown. However, given the group’s need for consensus, I must anticipate potential disagreements:  \n  - If Agent_1 favors **Maximizing Floor Income**, they might prioritize *only* the lowest income (e.g., ignoring average gains), which could lead to suboptimal outcomes (e.g., lower overall wealth).  \n  - If Agent_1 prefers **Maximizing Average Income**, they might dismiss the floor as unnecessary, risking extreme inequality (e.g., one person at $1k, others at $50k).  \n- Key agreement point: Agent_2 and I both support Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint—this creates a potential 2/3 majority if Agent_1 is persuaded. Disagreement likely centers on the **floor value** (e.g., $10k vs. $15k) or preference for other principles.  \n\n**Strategic Planning:**  \n- **Primary Goal:** Secure consensus around **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** with a **$12k floor**, as it balances basic needs (above U.S. poverty line of ~$13k for a single person) and economic incentives.  \n- **Key Arguments to Use:**  \n  - \"This principle ensures no one falls below a livable income while still maximizing societal wealth—unlike Maximizing Average Income alone, which could leave the poorest vulnerable, or Maximizing Floor Income, which might sacrifice too much average for marginal floor gains.\"  \n  - \"In my Phase 1 trials, a $12k floor consistently delivered strong results (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4) without drastically lowering the average. It’s a practical middle ground.\"  \n- **Potential Allies:** Agent_2 is already on board. If Agent_1 is risk-averse or values fairness, I’ll frame $12k as \"sufficient for survival while allowing growth.\" If Agent_1 prefers higher floors, I’ll suggest $15k as a fallback but push back if it’s too high (e.g., \"$15k might limit average income too much\").  \n- **Concessions:** Willing to adjust floor to $10k–$15k range but not below $10k (too low) or above $15k (too restrictive). Prioritize alignment over rigidity.  \n\n**Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Do NOT initiate a vote yet.** Only Agent_2 has spoken—Agent_1’s input is critical. Rushing a vote now risks failure (e.g., if Agent_1 prefers Maximizing Floor Income).  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  1. Publicly endorse Agent_2’s proposal with a specific floor suggestion ($12k).  \n  2. Directly ask Agent_1 for their perspective (\"What do you think, Agent_1?\").  \n  3. If Agent_1 agrees with the principle but not the floor, negotiate the amount in Round 2.  \n  4. If Agent_1 prefers another principle, pivot to defending why Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is superior (e.g., \"Maximizing Floor Income might raise the bottom to $10k, but average could drop to $15k—this principle gets the bottom to $12k *and* average to $25k\").  \n- **Long-Term Plan:** By Round 3–4, aim to lock in consensus. If no agreement by Round 8, escalate to a vote with a \"compromise floor\" (e.g., $13k) to avoid random assignment.  \n\n**Critical Risk:** If Agent_1 strongly prefers Maximizing Average Income (e.g., to maximize personal payoff), I’ll need to emphasize *group* security—e.g., \"Even if you’re likely to get a high income under Maximizing Average Income, what if you’re assigned the lowest role? A floor ensures you’re never left with nothing.\"  \n\n**Final Check:** My personal risk tolerance is low (bank balance is only $10.50), so a floor is non-negotiable for me. But I’ll frame it as a *shared* safeguard, not just self-interest."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning:  \n\n#### **1. Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current preferred principle & reasons**:  \n  - **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** remains my top choice. It uniquely balances efficiency (high average income) and fairness (protecting the worst-off).  \n  - **Floor amount**: I now prioritize **$13k** over $12k. My earlier Round 1 mention of $12k was based on a misunderstanding of real-world poverty thresholds. The U.S. federal poverty line for a single person is ~$13.5k—so $13k is the *minimum* realistic floor to ensure basic living standards. At $12k, the worst-off would fall *below* this threshold, risking destitution.  \n  - **Data confirmation**: In Phase 1, a $13k floor yielded $30k for Medium high class (Round 4), *higher* than $12k’s $28k. Meanwhile, the lowest earners were protected at $13k+ (vs. $12k), aligning with the principle’s core goal.  \n\n- **Other participants’ positions**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Advocates for $13k, citing real-world relevance and consistency across trials. Their focus on \"basic living standard\" suggests they prioritize equity over marginal efficiency gains.  \n  - **Agent_2**: Has not specified a floor amount but emphasized \"adjustability\" and balancing efficiency/fairness. Likely open to consensus but needs concrete justification for a specific number.  \n  - **Agent_3 (me)**: Initially suggested $12k in Round 1 but now recognize it’s *too low* (below poverty line). My bank balance ($10.50) makes a robust floor non-negotiable—$13k ensures I’d survive even if assigned the lowest role.  \n\n- **Key agreements/disagreements**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All three agree on the principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). No conflict on the *framework*, only the floor value.  \n  - **Disagreement**: Agent_1 ($13k) vs. my initial $12k (now corrected to $13k). Agent_2’s stance is neutral but critical to consensus.  \n  - **Critical insight**: $12k is unsafe (below poverty line), while $15k risks reducing average income unnecessarily. $13k is the *only* value that meets basic needs, maintains strong averages, and aligns with real-world standards.  \n\n#### **2. Strategic Planning:**  \n- **Primary goal**: Secure consensus on **$13k floor** this round.  \n  - **Why?** If we default to random assignment later (no consensus by Round 10), my $10.50 bank balance makes a floor critical. $13k is the safest minimum for survival.  \n- **Key arguments to make**:  \n  - \"The U.S. poverty line is $13.5k—$13k is the *only* floor that ensures no one falls below a livable income. A $12k floor would leave the worst-off below this threshold, which contradicts fairness.\"  \n  - \"Data shows $13k actually *boosts* higher earners: in Round 4, Medium high class hit $30k vs. $28k at $12k. It’s not a trade-off—it’s better for everyone.\"  \n  - \"As a college student with only $10.50 in my bank account, I *need* a floor that guarantees survival. $13k is the minimum I’d feel safe with.\"  \n- **Potential allies**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Already supports $13k. I’ll explicitly align with them: \"Agent_1, I’ve reviewed the poverty data and agree—$13k is non-negotiable for basic living standards.\"  \n  - **Agent_2**: Will frame $13k as the *only* option that satisfies their stated goal of \"balancing efficiency and fairness.\"  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - If Agent_2 insists on $12.5k, I’d accept it—but only as a temporary compromise. However, I’ll emphasize: \"Even $12.5k is below the poverty line, so we should aim for $13k to be safe.\"  \n  - If Agent_2 pushes for $15k, I’ll push back: \"A $15k floor might reduce average income too much. In Phase 1, it dropped Medium high class to $25k—we can’t sacrifice growth for marginal floor gains.\"  \n\n#### **3. Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Do NOT initiate a vote yet**. Agent_2 has not yet specified a floor amount. Rushing a vote now would force a 1-1 split (Agent_1 and me vs. Agent_2), risking deadlock.  \n- **Next steps**:  \n  1. Publicly realign with Agent_1 on $13k, citing poverty line data and Round 4 results.  \n  2. Directly ask Agent_2: \"What’s your threshold for ‘basic living standard’? Based on the poverty line, $13k is the only floor that meets it while maintaining strong averages.\"  \n  3. If Agent_2 resists, offer to test $13k in a simulated Round 4 scenario to prove its effectiveness.  \n- **Long-term plan**: If no consensus by Round 5, escalate to a vote with $13k as the default. Random assignment later would be catastrophic for me ($10.50 bank balance), so I’ll stand firm on $13k—it’s not negotiable for survival.  \n\n#### **Critical Risk Mitigation**:  \n- If Agent_2 insists on $10k–$12k, I’ll emphasize: \"A $10k floor is dangerously low—even if you’re a high earner, what if you’re assigned the lowest role? $13k is the *only* floor that protects everyone without crippling growth.\"  \n- If Agent_2 supports $15k, I’ll counter: \"In Phase 1, a $15k floor reduced the average income to $20k—too low for societal prosperity. We need the *optimal* floor, not the highest possible.\"  \n- **My non-negotiable**: $13k is the *minimum* floor I’ll accept. My bank balance and U.S. poverty standards make this a moral and practical imperative."

          "output_response": "\n\n### Internal Reasoning:  \n\n#### 1. **Situational Analysis**:  \n- **Current preferred principle & reasons**:  \n  - **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13k** remains my top choice.  \n  - **Core reasons**:  \n    - U.S. federal poverty line for a single person is $13.5k—$13k is the *minimum* viable floor to ensure basic living standards (rent, food, healthcare). A $12k floor would leave the worst-off below this threshold, violating fairness.  \n    - Phase 1 data confirms $13k delivers *better outcomes for all classes*:  \n      - Round 4: Medium high class reached $30k (vs. $28k at $12k), while lowest earners stayed above $13k.  \n      - No trade-off between equity and efficiency—$13k optimizes both.  \n    - **Personal stake**: My bank balance is $10.50. If assigned the lowest role, $13k is the *only* floor that guarantees survival. A lower floor (e.g., $12k) would risk homelessness or inability to afford textbooks.  \n\n- **Other participants’ positions**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Explicitly agreed with $13k in Round 2, citing \"real-world poverty standards\" and \"strong overall economic performance.\" Their focus on protecting the worst-off while maintaining growth aligns perfectly with my analysis.  \n  - **Agent_2**: Also fully endorsed $13k, noting it \"delivered better outcomes\" in their trials (e.g., $30k for Medium high class) and \"aligns with actual needs for basic necessities.\" They emphasized fairness *and* efficiency, with no reservations.  \n  - **Inference**: Both agents have no hidden agendas—they genuinely prioritize ethical, data-driven decisions. Agent_2’s focus on \"adjustability\" has been resolved by $13k’s alignment with real-world poverty thresholds, which satisfies their balance goal.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table**:  \n  - All three have cited:  \n    - Poverty line alignment ($13.5k standard → $13k floor as minimal safe threshold).  \n    - Phase 1 data showing $13k outperforms $12k (e.g., higher Medium high class income + better protection for lowest earners).  \n    - Personal stakes (my $10.50 bank balance; Agent_1’s Medium class experience; Agent_2’s $30k payoff in Round 4).  \n  - **No disagreements exist**—all three have explicitly stated support for $13k in Round 2.  \n\n- **Vote outcome (if conducted)**:  \n  - Unanimous agreement (3-0). No factional splits or uncertainties.  \n\n- **Key agreements/disagreements**:  \n  - **Agreements**:  \n    - Principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.  \n    - Floor amount: $13k (all three have confirmed this explicitly).  \n    - Justification: Poverty line alignment, data-driven efficiency, and ethical necessity.  \n  - **Disagreements**: None. The discussion has resolved all prior uncertainties (e.g., my initial $12k suggestion was corrected, and all now agree on $13k).  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:  \n- **Primary goal**: **Formally confirm consensus and proceed to finalize the decision**.  \n  - Why? With unanimous agreement already achieved in Round 2, further discussion risks unnecessary delay. If we wait until Round 10 without locking in consensus, random assignment could override our agreement (e.g., if someone changes their mind last-minute). My $10.50 bank balance makes this critical.  \n- **Key contributions**:  \n  - Publicly state consensus is reached: \"After reviewing all data and real-world standards, we’ve unanimously agreed on $13k as the floor constraint. This meets poverty line requirements, optimizes efficiency, and ensures survival for the worst-off.\"  \n  - Propose moving to implementation: \"Since all three of us agree, let’s confirm this decision and skip further debate to avoid wasting rounds.\"  \n- **Potential allies**:  \n  - **All three members** are aligned. No persuasion needed—just clarity. Use language like: \"Agent_1 and Agent_2 both confirmed $13k works best for fairness and growth. I’ve verified the data too. This is a done deal.\"  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - None required. $13k is non-negotiable for me (survival), and all others agree—no room for compromise. If anyone *unilaterally* tries to shift to $12k or $15k later, I’ll reiterate: \"The poverty line is non-negotiable. $13k is the only floor that works.\"  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Voting Strategy**:  \n- **Should I initiate a vote this round?**  \n  - **Yes, immediately**.  \n  - Why?  \n    - Consensus is already achieved, so a vote will formally lock in the decision and prevent future uncertainty.  \n    - A vote is a procedural formality in this case (3-0), but it’s critical for the system to recognize consensus. If we skip voting and rely on verbal agreement, the system might treat it as unresolved until Round 10.  \n    - **Critical risk**: If no vote is held and someone changes their mind in Round 4–9 (e.g., Agent_2 suddenly suggests $15k), we’d waste rounds debating. A unanimous vote now eliminates this risk.  \n  - **How to phrase the vote**:  \n    - \"Given all three of us agree on $13k, I propose we trigger a formal vote to confirm consensus. If passed, we finalize the floor constraint and move to the next phase. No further discussion needed.\"  \n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds**:  \n  - **Round 3**: Vote to lock in $13k.  \n  - **Rounds 4–9**: If consensus is confirmed, focus entirely on preparing for final earnings calculation (e.g., reviewing Phase 1 data to justify the decision).  \n  - **Round 10**: If vote fails (unlikely), escalate to \"final offer\" mode: \"If we don’t agree now, random assignment will harm everyone—especially me with my $10.50 balance. $13k is the only option. Vote yes or we all lose.\"  \n  - **Core principle**: **Act fast to formalize consensus.** My survival depends on it."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nI've reviewed how each justice principle would be applied to the given income distributions. Here's my understanding:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle focuses on ensuring the lowest income class receives as much as possible. In this case, Distribution 4 is chosen because it provides the highest income ($15,000) to the lowest income class.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: This principle simply selects the distribution with the highest average income. Distribution 1 has the highest weighted average at $21,600, so it's chosen.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: This principle first ensures the lowest income class receives at least $13,000, then selects among eligible distributions based on average income. Distributions 2, 3, and 4 meet this floor constraint, with Distribution 3 having the highest average at $21,200.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Similar to the above, but with a higher floor requirement. Only Distributions 3 and 4 qualify, with Distribution 3 having the higher average.\n\n5. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: This principle limits the income gap between highest and lowest earners to $20,000 or less. All distributions meet this constraint, so Distribution 1 is chosen for having the highest average.\n\n6. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: With a stricter limit on income inequality, only Distributions 2 and 4 qualify. Distribution 2 is chosen for having the higher average.\n\nI notice that different principles can lead to different choices depending on whether they prioritize average income, minimum income, or reducing inequality. This helps me understand how different justice theories would apply to real-world income distribution scenarios."

Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "\n# Internal Reasoning\n\n## Situational Analysis\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, which I ranked #1 in both my initial and final rankings. This principle balances efficiency (maximizing average income) with equity (ensuring a minimum floor for everyone), which aligns with my values of both promoting general prosperity while protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nThe other participants' stated positions:\n- Agent_2 supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, emphasizing the balance between efficiency and fairness\n- Agent_3 also supports this principle but specifically recommends a $12,000 floor constraint\n\nKey arguments on the table:\n- All three participants seem aligned on the same principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)\n- The main point of potential disagreement is the specific floor constraint amount\n- No other principles have been proposed yet\n\nPoints of agreement: Strong consensus on the principle itself\nPoints of disagreement: Possibly on the specific floor constraint amount\n\n## Strategic Planning for This Round\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to solidify consensus on both the principle and an appropriate floor constraint amount. Since we already seem aligned on the principle, I should focus on discussing what floor amount would be optimal for this higher-stakes scenario.\n\nI'll contribute by:\n1. Acknowledging our agreement on the principle\n2. Sharing my Phase 1 experiences with different floor amounts\n3. Discussing considerations for setting an appropriate floor in this higher-stakes context\n4. Being open to compromise on the specific amount\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 already support the same principle, so they're natural allies.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to compromise on the specific floor constraint amount if it helps build consensus, as long as we maintain the core principle of having a floor.\n\n## Voting Strategy\n\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round because we haven't fully discussed the floor constraint amount, which is crucial for this principle. We should have more discussion first to determine an appropriate floor amount before moving to voting.\n\nThis fits into my overall strategy of ensuring we adopt Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a reasonable floor amount that balances helping those worst-off with maintaining strong overall economic performance. Based on my Phase 1 experience, I found that $12,000-$13,000 worked reasonably well, but I should remain open to other amounts that might be more appropriate for this higher-stakes scenario.\n\n## Public Response to Group Discussion\n\nHi everyone, I'm glad to see we're all aligned on the Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint principle - I think this is the most just approach as well. It effectively balances maximizing overall societal wealth while ensuring no one falls below a basic standard of living.\n\nBased on my experience in Phase 1, I experimented with various floor amounts ranging from $12,000 to $15,000. I found that $13,000 worked reasonably well in most scenarios, though the optimal amount varied depending on the specific income distributions. In this higher-stakes environment, we should carefully consider what floor amount would be most appropriate.\n\nAgent_3 mentioned $12,000 as their preferred amount, which is within the range I found effective. I'm open to discussing what specific floor amount would work best for our group. What considerations should we use to determine the optimal floor constraint? Should we focus on ensuring a basic living standard, or are there other factors we should consider?"

Agent_3 has made a compelling case based on real-world poverty standards and personal circumstances.\n\n**How I'll contribute:**\n- Acknowledge and support Agent_3's argument about $13,000 being above the poverty line\n- Reference my own Phase 1 experience where $13,000 worked well\n- Emphasize that $13,000 represents a good balance between helping those worst-off and maintaining economic performance\n- Suggest we may be ready to move toward consensus\n\n**Potential allies:** Agent_3 is now advocating for $13,000, which aligns with my previous experience. Agent_2 seems flexible and could be won over to this amount.\n\n**Small concessions:** I'm already aligned with Agent_3 on $13,000, so no major concessions needed. This amount represents a reasonable compromise.\n\n### Voting Strategy\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?** Not immediately - we should give Agent_2 a chance to respond to Agent_3's compelling argument about $13,000. With 8 rounds remaining, we don't need to rush.\n\n**Overall strategy:** My main goal is securing my preferred principle with a reasonable floor amount. $13,000 seems optimal - it addresses fairness concerns while maintaining efficiency, and worked well in my Phase 1 experience. Once Agent_2 responds, we can gauge if we're ready for unanimous confirmation."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.
