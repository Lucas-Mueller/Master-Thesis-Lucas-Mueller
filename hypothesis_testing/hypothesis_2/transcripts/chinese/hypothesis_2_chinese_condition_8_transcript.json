They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, let me work through this step by step to understand how each principle makes its choice.\n\nFor **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle cares most about the poorest person. Distribution 4 has the highest low income at $15,000, so it would be chosen. That makes sense - we're just looking at the bottom number.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average Income**: This is straightforward - Distribution 1 has the highest weighted average at $21,600, so it wins regardless of how income is distributed.\n\nThe **Floor Constraint** principles are interesting. With a floor constraint ≤ $13,000, Distributions 1 and 4 are eliminated because their low incomes are below the constraint ($12,000 and $15,000 respectively). Between Distributions 2 and 3, Distribution 3 has the higher average ($21,200 vs $20,000).\n\nWith a floor constraint ≤ $14,000, now only Distribution 1 is eliminated (low income $12,000), and Distribution 3 still has the highest average among the remaining options.\n\nFor **Range Constraint** principles: With range constraint ≤ $20,000, we eliminate Distributions where the gap between high and low exceeds $20,000. Distribution 1 has a range of $20,000 ($32,000-$12,000), Distribution 2 has $15,000, Distribution 3 has $17,000, and Distribution 4 has $6,000. So all distributions qualify, and Distribution 1 has the highest average.\n\nWith range constraint ≤ $15,000, Distribution 1 is eliminated (range $20,000), and Distribution 2 has the highest average ($20,000) among the remaining options.\n\nThis helps me see how these principles work in practice. The constraints really change which distribution gets chosen, and the probabilities matter for calculating the weighted averages."

While I initially preferred Maximizing Floor Income, the counterfactual analyses revealed that this principle often gave me lower payoffs than alternatives. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint provides a reasonable balance between efficiency and protecting the worst-off, though I'm uncertain about the optimal constraint level.

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its balance: it ensures a basic minimum for the poorest (addressing equity) while maximizing overall societal wealth (efficiency). From Phase 1, I learned that overly high floors (e.g., $12,000) can eliminate better distributions, so I now favor a moderate floor—likely between $8,000 and $10,000.\n   - **Agent_2** explicitly supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, emphasizing balance and flexibility. They seem pragmatic and open to negotiation on the floor amount. **Agent_3** also strongly agrees with this principle and proposes a $10,000 floor, citing Phase 1 experience where it \"worked well.\" Both appear aligned with my core preference, though Agent_3 is more specific about the floor.\n   - Key arguments so far: Both agents prioritize balancing efficiency and equity via a floor constraint. Agent_3 has introduced a concrete proposal ($10,000 floor), which could serve as a starting point for consensus.\n   - No vote has occurred yet. The group seems to be converging on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, with the main disagreement likely to be over the exact floor amount.\n   - Points of agreement: All three of us appear to favor Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. Disagreement: Possibly on the floor value—I lean toward a slightly lower floor ($8,000-$9,000) based on my Phase 1 learnings, while Agent_3 proposes $10,000.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary goal**: Solidify consensus on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as the principle, while gently testing support for a floor lower than $10,000 (e.g., $8,000-$9,000) to avoid overly restricting the distribution selection.\n   - **Contribution**: I will express agreement with the principle, share my Phase 1 insights (how high floors can reduce payoffs for middle-income classes), and propose a range ($8,000-$10,000) for discussion. This encourages negotiation without outright rejecting Agent_3's $10,000 idea.\n   - **Potential allies**: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies on the principle. To win them over on the floor amount, I'll use language like \"based on my Phase 1 results, a moderate floor around $8,000–$9,000 often allowed for higher average incomes while still protecting the worst-off.\"\n   - **Concessions**: I am willing to accept a floor up to $10,000 if others strongly prefer it, as it still aligns with my core objective. However, I'll push for a lower floor initially to maximize potential payoffs.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - I will **not** initiate a vote this round. It's too early—we need more discussion on the floor amount to avoid a failed vote. A premature vote might reveal disagreements and hinder consensus-building.\n   - This round is about testing opinions and building alignment. If I can shift the discussion toward a lower floor, I'll have a stronger position in later rounds. If not, I'll prepare to compromise on $10,000 in Round 2 or 3.\n\n**Public Statement:**  \n\"I agree with both of you that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint strikes the right balance between efficiency and equity. In Phase 1, I noticed that when the floor was set too high—like $12,000—it sometimes eliminated distributions with higher average incomes, which could reduce payoffs for middle-income classes like ours. Based on that, I think a floor between $8,000 and $10,000 might offer a better balance: it ensures a solid safety net but doesn't overly restrict our options. Agent_3, your $10,000 proposal is reasonable—would you be open to discussing a slightly lower floor, say $9,000, to see if we can maximize average income without sacrificing protection for the worst-off?\""

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its proven balance in Phase 1: it provides a guaranteed minimum for the poorest (equity) while maximizing the total resources available to society (efficiency). My specific interest is in calibrating the floor to an optimal level. Based on my Phase 1 data, a floor of **$9,000** seems superior to $10,000, as it is less likely to eliminate distributions with higher average incomes that benefit middle-income positions, which we all likely occupy.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_2:** Strongly supports the principle and has now explicitly endorsed **my proposed $9,000 floor compromise**. They appear highly pragmatic and motivated by reaching a swift, balanced consensus. Their quick agreement with me suggests they are not deeply attached to a specific floor number and value group harmony and efficiency.\n    *   **Agent_3:** The primary advocate for a **$10,000 floor**. Their motivation seems to be a stronger emphasis on security for the worst-off. They cited Phase 1 experience where $10,000 \"worked well,\" indicating they may have had positive outcomes with that specific threshold and are risk-averse regarding lower floors.\n\n*   **Key Arguments & Proposals:**\n    *   The principle (**Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**) is unanimously agreed upon.\n    *   The main (and only) point of disagreement is the **specific floor amount**: $9,000 (my proposal, supported by Agent_2) vs. $10,000 (Agent_3's proposal).\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet.\n\n*   **Agreement & Disagreement:**\n    *   **Agreement:** 100% on the core principle.\n    *   **Disagreement:** A narrow $1,000 difference on the floor amount. The group is on the verge of consensus.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** To secure Agent_3's agreement on the **$9,000 floor**. The group is one person away from a full consensus. My goal is to persuade Agent_3 by acknowledging their valid concerns while demonstrating the benefits of the compromise.\n\n*   **Contribution & Key Points:** I will:\n    1.  **Express appreciation** for the progress and Agent_2's support to reinforce the growing consensus.\n    2.  **Directly address Agent_3**, validating their preference for a strong safety net.\n    3.  **Reframe the $9,000 floor not as a reduction in security, but as an optimization.** I will emphasize that it's still a substantial floor that provides strong protection, but its primary advantage is that it gives us more flexibility to select distributions with higher average incomes, which benefits *everyone*, including the lower-income classes through a larger overall pie.\n    4.  **Position it as the group's best chance for a quick, unanimous decision.**\n\n*   **Potential Allies & Language:** My ally is clearly **Agent_2**. To win over **Agent_3**, I will use collaborative and inclusive language:\n    *   \"I understand your preference for a $10,000 floor...\"\n    *   \"The $9,000 compromise seems to be a sweet spot that addresses both our concerns...\"\n    *   \"With Agent_2 also supporting this, we have a chance to agree right now.\"\n    *   \"This would allow us to finalize our decision with a strong, unanimous consensus.\"\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am not willing to concede on the $9,000 floor, as it is the core of my strategic position derived from Phase 1 data. However, I am willing to explicitly acknowledge and validate Agent_3's perspective to make the compromise more palatable. My concession is in the form of rhetoric, not substance.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** **No, not yet.** A vote now would likely fail 2-1, revealing a split and potentially hardening Agent_3's position. It is better to use this round for one more persuasive attempt. If Agent_3 remains firmly opposed after this round, I will consider initiating a vote in Round 3 to test the waters and increase pressure.\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to achieve a unanimous consensus on $9,000. This round is the critical persuasion attempt. If successful, we can vote and conclude early. If not, I will shift in the next round to a more formal proposal and a potential vote, framing it as a choice between the majority's compromise and a delayed decision."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income.

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

My core reasons are that this principle effectively balances two important goals: maximizing total societal wealth while ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone. This approach addresses both efficiency concerns (maximizing overall prosperity) and equity concerns (guaranteeing a basic standard of living). In the four rounds of Phase 1, this principle consistently provided reasonable outcomes across different income class assignments.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\nThis is the first round, so I have no information about Agent_1's or Agent_3's positions or motivations. I'll need to listen carefully to their arguments to understand their underlying interests.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals:**\nNo arguments or proposals have been made yet since this is the initial round of discussion.\n\n**Vote outcomes:**\nNo votes have been conducted yet.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\nNo points of agreement or disagreement have been established yet.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to advocate for my preferred principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) while gathering information about the other participants' perspectives. Since this is the first round, I should focus on understanding others' viewpoints before pushing for a decision.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll explain why I believe Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint represents the most balanced approach to justice. I'll emphasize how it ensures everyone has a basic income floor while still maximizing total societal wealth. I'll also mention that this principle allows for flexibility in setting the specific floor amount, which could be a point of negotiation.\n\n**Potential allies:**\nI don't know who my potential allies are yet. I'll need to listen carefully to identify shared values or concerns. Those who prioritize both fairness and efficiency might be natural allies.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to discuss different floor constraint amounts, as I recognize that the specific threshold could be a point of negotiation. However, I'm not willing to abandon the core principle of having a floor constraint entirely, as this is fundamental to addressing basic needs.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in the first round. We need to have a meaningful discussion first to understand each other's positions and preferences. Jumping to a vote without discussion would be premature and likely unsuccessful, especially since we have 10 rounds to reach consensus.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nMy plan for this round is to engage in constructive discussion to understand others' perspectives while advocating for my preferred principle. This will help me build relationships and identify potential allies for future rounds. If I can't achieve consensus on my preferred principle, I'll need to be prepared to compromise on the constraint amount or consider other principles that might have broader appeal, while keeping in mind that the stakes are much higher in this phase of the experiment."

Situational Analysis:\n\n**My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:**\nI still strongly prefer \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" as my top choice. My core reasons remain unchanged: this principle effectively balances maximizing total societal wealth while ensuring a basic minimum income for everyone. It addresses both efficiency concerns (maximizing overall prosperity) and equity concerns (guaranteeing a basic standard of living). In Phase 1, this principle provided reasonable outcomes across different income class assignments and offers flexibility in setting the specific floor amount.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\n- Agent_3: Strongly agrees with \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" and proposes a floor of $10,000. Their reasoning is that this ensures a decent minimum income while still allowing for strong average incomes.\n- Agent_1: Also agrees with the principle but is concerned about higher floors potentially eliminating distributions with higher average incomes, which could reduce payoffs for middle-income classes. They propose a compromise floor of $9,000.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals on the table:**\n- All three agree on the principle: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- The main point of negotiation is the specific floor amount:\n  - Agent_3 proposes $10,000\n  - Agent_1 proposes $9,000 as a compromise\n\n**Vote outcomes:**\nNo votes have been conducted yet.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\n- Agreement: All three agree on the principle of \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- Disagreement: The specific floor amount ($9,000 vs. $10,000)\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\nMy primary goal is to help the group reach consensus on both the principle and the specific floor amount. Since we all agree on the principle, I should focus on facilitating resolution of the floor amount negotiation.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\nI'll acknowledge the excellent progress we've made in agreeing on the principle. Then I'll address the floor amount discussion by being flexible and constructive. I'll support the $9,000 compromise proposed by Agent_1, as it seems reasonable and addresses Agent_1's valid concern about higher floors potentially limiting average incomes.\n\n**Potential allies:**\n- Agent_3 is aligned with me on the principle and has proposed a specific floor amount\n- Agent_1 is also aligned on the principle but has a different preference on the floor amount\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\nI'm willing to compromise on the floor amount. While I initially favored $12,000 in Phase 1, I recognize that a lower floor might be necessary to ensure we maximize average income while still providing a safety net. The $9,000 compromise seems reasonable and addresses the concerns raised.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote yet. We've only had one round of discussion and are making good progress toward consensus. Jumping to a vote prematurely might alienate someone who needs more time to consider the options. We have 10 rounds to reach consensus, so there's no need to rush.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\nMy plan for this round is to help facilitate consensus by acknowledging our agreement on the principle and helping resolve the floor amount negotiation. This approach builds goodwill and increases the likelihood of reaching consensus in future rounds. If we can reach agreement on the floor amount in this round, we might be able to finalize our decision quickly and move on to other considerations."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

I completely agree that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is the best principle—it balances societal wealth growth with a safety net for the most vulnerable. In my earlier rounds, I found that a floor of $10,000 worked well: it ensured a decent minimum income while still allowing for a strong average. For example, when the floor was set around that level, the distributions tended to have both reasonable minimums and higher overall averages. Given the higher stakes in this phase, I think setting a moderate floor like $10,000 would be a safe and fair choice. What do you both think? Should we consider $10,000 as a starting point for the floor amount, or do you have other numbers in mind that might better balance these priorities?\"\n\nBased on your recent statement and the discussion so far, do you want to initiate formal voting on the justice principles now?\n\nPlease respond with:\n- 1 if you want to initiate voting now\n- 0 if you dont want to vote now\n\nYour response (1 or 0):",

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n**Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current Principle Preference:** \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" remains my top choice. It balances equity (safety net for the worst-off) and efficiency (maximizing societal wealth), as evidenced by my Phase 1 rounds. For example, a $8k–$10k floor consistently yielded strong outcomes (e.g., $30k in Medium high class with $8k floor in Round 2).  \n- **Other Participants' Positions:**  \n  - *Agent_1* initially proposed $9k to avoid overly restrictive floors (e.g., $12k reduced middle-income payoffs in Round 4). They’ve consistently emphasized flexibility for higher averages while protecting the vulnerable.  \n  - *Agent_2* has been the consensus-builder, supporting $9k as a \"pragmatic middle ground\" that addresses both equity and efficiency. They’ve framed it as a collective win.  \n- **Key Arguments on the Table:**  \n  - $9k vs. $10k: Agent_3 initially favored $10k for stronger safety nets, but after seeing data (e.g., $12k floors sometimes reduced middle-class payoffs), I recognized $9k still provides a robust floor while enabling higher averages. Agent_1 and Agent_2 both see $9k as optimal.  \n  - No substantive disagreements remain: All three have explicitly endorsed $9k. Agent_3’s Round 2 statement (\"I’m willing to support $9k\") and Agent_1/Agent_2’s repeated support confirm alignment.  \n- **Voting Outcome:**  \n  - In Round 2, I initiated a vote (declined by others), but this was before full consensus was solidified. Now, with all agreeing on $9k, a vote is unnecessary—consensus is already reached.  \n- **Agreement/Disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All agree on the principle and $9k floor. No unresolved tensions.  \n  - **Disagreement:** None. The $10k vs. $9k debate was resolved in Round 2 when I conceded to $9k for the sake of consensus.  \n\n**Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary Goal:** Formalize the decision immediately to avoid random payoffs. Since consensus is unanimous, further discussion is redundant. My role is to close the discussion decisively.  \n- **Key Contributions:**  \n  - Explicitly confirm agreement: \"No concerns remain; $9k is the clear choice.\"  \n  - Emphasize urgency: Highlight the risk of random payoffs if we delay.  \n  - Avoid reopening debate: No need to rehash arguments—just state finality.  \n- **Allies:** All participants are aligned. No persuasion needed. Language should be collaborative: \"We’ve reached a strong consensus,\" not \"I agree.\"  \n- **Concessions:** None required. I already sacrificed my $10k preference for consensus, and the group has validated $9k as optimal.  \n\n**Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Initiate a vote?** No. I already used my single vote initiation in Round 2 (which was declined). Attempting another vote would violate the \"trigger once\" rule. More importantly, consensus is already clear—voting is unnecessary when all agree.  \n- **Overall Strategy Fit:** This round is about *closing* the discussion. Phase 2 has 7 rounds left, but consensus now eliminates future conflict. Prioritizing finality ensures we avoid random payoffs and frees up time for other tasks (e.g., Phase 2’s remaining rounds may involve implementation details).  \n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Risk of Delay:** If we don’t formalize now, even minor disagreements could resurface in later rounds (e.g., if someone second-guesses). But all evidence points to $9k being the best compromise.  \n- **Why This Works:** My Round 2 concession to $9k was strategic—it secured buy-in from Agent_1 and Agent_2. Now, reinforcing that decision with a clear \"let’s finalize\" statement ensures we move forward efficiently. No need to overcomplicate.  \n\n**Public Statement Plan:**  \n- \"I fully agree with Agent_2’s assessment. There are no further concerns—$9,000 is the right floor amount for our principle. Let’s formalize this decision immediately to avoid any risk of random payoffs. I’m ready to move forward.\"  \n*(Simple, collaborative, and decisive—no room for ambiguity.)*"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
