They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I can see how each principle works in practice with these examples. Let me break this down:\n\n**Maximizing Floor Income** clearly prioritizes the poorest person - Distribution 4 has the highest low income at $15,000, so it gets chosen even though it has the lowest average income overall.\n\n**Maximizing Average Income** is straightforward - Distribution 1 has the highest weighted average at $21,600, so it wins regardless of how unequal the distribution might be.\n\nThe **Floor Constraint** principles are interesting - they're looking for the highest average income BUT only among distributions that meet the minimum floor requirement. For the $13,000 floor constraint, Distributions 2, 3, and 4 all qualify (their low incomes are ≥$13,000), and Distribution 3 has the highest average among these. Same logic applies for the $14,000 floor constraint.\n\nThe **Range Constraint** principles work similarly but focus on the gap between richest and poorest. For the $20,000 range constraint, Distributions 1, 2, and 3 qualify (their high-low differences are ≤$20,000), and Distribution 1 has the highest average. For the tighter $15,000 constraint, only Distribution 2 qualifies, so it wins by default.\n\nThis helps clarify how these principles actually operate. The constraints create eligibility filters, and then the principle picks the highest average from the qualifying distributions. Without constraints, it's just about maximizing the overall average."

I believe it strikes the best balance between ensuring a basic standard of living for the poorest members of society while still allowing for overall economic growth and efficiency. The core reason is that it prevents extreme poverty without completely sacrificing the benefits of a productive economy.\n   - The other participants have both expressed support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint:\n     - **Agent_2** advocates for this principle with a floor of $12,000, citing personal experience from Phase 1 where they earned more with this principle compared to pure Floor Income. They emphasize fairness and societal thriving.\n     - **Agent_3** also supports this principle, having consistently chosen it in Phase 1 with floors around $12,000–$13,000. They highlight balanced outcomes and protection of the lowest income.\n   - Key arguments on the table: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 have emphasized the balance between fairness (protecting the worst-off) and efficiency (maximizing average income). They propose a floor around $12,000 but are open to discussion.\n   - No vote has been conducted yet, but there appears to be strong initial agreement on the principle itself. The main point of disagreement might be the exact floor amount, but even that seems flexible.\n   - Points of agreement: All three of us seem to favor Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint over other principles. There is consensus on the importance of a floor to prevent extreme poverty.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary goal:** To solidify the group's agreement on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and begin discussing the specific floor amount. I want to build on the existing consensus and move towards a concrete proposal.\n   - **Contribution to discussion:** I will express agreement with Agent_2 and Agent_3, reinforce the strengths of the principle, and share my Phase 1 experiences to add weight to the argument. I will then propose a specific floor amount to test the waters.\n   - **Potential allies:** Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are clear allies on the principle. I can use language that acknowledges their points (\"I agree that balance is key\") and builds on their examples.\n   - **Concessions:** I am willing to be flexible on the floor amount. My Phase 1 applications used floors between $13,000 and $15,000, but I can support $12,000 if that is the group preference. The exact number is secondary to adopting the principle itself.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. We are only in Round 1 of 10, and we have strong initial agreement on the principle. Rushing a vote might overlook nuances in the floor amount discussion. It's better to use a few rounds to build solid consensus and ensure everyone is fully committed.\n   - My plan for this round is to reinforce the consensus and start the floor amount discussion. In future rounds, if the floor amount is agreed upon, I might propose a vote to formalize our choice.\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nHi Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nI completely agree with both of you. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced and just principle. In Phase 1, I also consistently chose this principle because it ensures nobody falls below a basic standard of living while still allowing society to benefit from economic efficiency.\n\nFor example, in my rounds, I used floors between $13,000 and $15,000, and while I sometimes earned less personally compared to pure efficiency principles, I felt it was the right choice for society as a whole. I think your suggestion of a $12,000 floor is a good starting point—it's a solid baseline that protects the worst-off without being too restrictive.\n\nSince we all seem to be on the same page about the principle itself, maybe we can discuss the floor amount in more detail. What factors should we consider when setting the exact floor? Should it be based on a minimum living standard, or are there other criteria we should think about?"

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - **My Preferred Principle:** My current preferred justice principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is that it provides a critical safety net for the poorest members of society while still allowing for economic growth and efficiency. It prevents extreme poverty without completely sacrificing the benefits of a productive economy, striking a balance between compassion and pragmatism.\n   - **Other Participants' Positions:**\n     - **Agent_2** strongly advocates for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a **$12,000 floor**. They are using Phase 1 data to argue that this specific floor amount provides both efficiency and fairness without trade-offs, citing examples where payoffs matched pure Maximizing Average Income but with the added floor protection. Their underlying motivation appears to be optimizing for both individual and societal benefit, emphasizing realistic baselines for basic needs.\n     - **Agent_3** also supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and is open to discussing the floor amount, having used floors between $12,000–$13,000 in Phase 1. Their motivation seems aligned with balanced outcomes and protection of the lowest income, similar to mine and Agent_2's.\n   - **Key Arguments and Proposals:** The main proposal on the table is Agent_2's push for a **$12,000 floor**, backed by Phase 1 data showing it avoids trade-offs between fairness and efficiency. They argue that higher floors (e.g., $15,000) can reduce average income significantly, while $12,000 is sufficient for basic needs like rent and essentials.\n   - **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet. The strong consensus on the principle itself suggests that a vote might soon be feasible, but the floor amount is the current point of discussion.\n   - **Agreement and Disagreement:** There is **near-unanimous agreement** on the principle of Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The only potential disagreement is on the **exact floor amount**—I previously used higher floors ($13,000–$15,000), while Agent_2 is firmly advocating for $12,000. However, this disagreement seems minor and negotiable.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary Goal:** To align with Agent_2's data-driven argument for a $12,000 floor while ensuring the group solidifies around this specific amount. I aim to build consensus by acknowledging the validity of their Phase 1 examples and expressing flexibility on the floor amount.\n   - **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n     - **Acknowledge and support** Agent_2's Phase 1 data, emphasizing that $12,000 avoids trade-offs and is pragmatically sound.\n     - **Share my Phase 1 experiences** to show that while I used higher floors, I recognize the cost to average income and am willing to adapt.\n     - **Propose a slight compromise** by suggesting we lock in $12,000 as the floor, given its balance of fairness and efficiency.\n   - **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies. I will use collaborative language like \"I agree with your analysis\" and \"Your data makes a strong case\" to reinforce unity.\n   - **Concessions:** I am willing to concede on the floor amount, moving from my previous $13,000–$15,000 range to **$12,000**, as it aligns with the group's data-backed reasoning and does not compromise the core principle.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate a Vote?** Not this round. We are only in Round 2, and while consensus is strong, I want to ensure everyone is fully committed to the $12,000 floor after discussing it further. Rushing a vote might leave residual doubts. I'll save the vote for a later round when the group appears ready to formalize the decision.\n   - **Overall Strategy:** My plan for this round is to reinforce the $12,000 floor proposal and test for any remaining concerns. If the group solidifies around this amount, I may propose a vote in Round 3 or 4 to lock in our decision early, allowing us to use remaining rounds for refinement or backup plans.\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nHi Agent_2 and Agent_3,\n\nI really appreciate your data-driven approach, Agent_2. Your Phase 1 examples make a compelling case for the $12,000 floor—especially how it matched the payoff of pure Maximizing Average Income in Round 4 while still guaranteeing that critical safety net. That's exactly the balance we're aiming for: no trade-off between fairness and efficiency.\n\nIn my Phase 1 rounds, I tended to use slightly higher floors, but I see now that those came with a cost to average income, as you pointed out with the $15,000 example. $12,000 does seem like a pragmatic floor that covers basic needs without stifling growth, and I'm convinced it's the right choice.\n\nSince we all agree on the principle and the data supports $12,000, should we consider this our group proposal? Agent_3, you mentioned openness to discussing the amount—does $12,000 work for you too? If so, we could be close to a consensus."

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

Maximizing Average Income\n\nOverall certainty: very sure\n\nMy experience throughout this experiment has reinforced my conviction that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint offers the optimal balance between ensuring basic dignity for all while maintaining economic efficiency. The practical applications demonstrated how this principle provides essential protection for the most vulnerable members of society without completely sacrificing overall prosperity. The $12,000 floor constraint that our group agreed upon represents a thoughtful compromise that ensures adequate minimum living standards while preserving economic incentives.\n\nMaximizing Floor Income comes second because while prioritizing the worst-off is morally important, completely ignoring average income can be too restrictive and potentially inefficient. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint is valuable for limiting inequality but may be less practical than ensuring a minimum floor. Maximizing Average Income remains my least preferred option as it ignores inequality and basic standards of living entirely, which doesn't align with my sense of justice.\n\nThe group discussion and counterfactual analyses further validated this ranking, showing that reasonable people can converge on balanced solutions through evidence-based reasoning."

With a tighter ≤$15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 is chosen instead.\n\nThis helps clarify how these principles actually make trade-offs in practice. The constraints create interesting boundaries where the \"best\" distribution changes depending on what limits we set."

This balances protecting the worst-off with maximizing societal prosperity, which I believe is the most just approach. My Phase 1 experience showed that this principle often yielded reasonable personal payoffs while ensuring a decent minimum standard.\n   - Agent_2 has already voiced strong support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $12,000 floor, citing their Phase 1 results where they earned more with this principle compared to pure Floor Income. This suggests they value both efficiency and basic protection, making them a natural ally.\n   - No other participants have spoken yet, so I need to gauge their positions. They might favor other principles like pure average maximization (if they prioritize efficiency) or floor income (if they prioritize absolute protection for the worst-off).\n   - Key arguments so far: Agent_2 emphasized the balance between protection and prosperity, using personal earnings as evidence. The main proposal is Floor Constraint at $12k.\n   - No vote has occurred yet, so alliances are still forming. Agreement exists between me and Agent_2 on the principle, but the floor amount might need negotiation. Disagreement could arise if others prefer different principles entirely.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - My primary goal is to solidify support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and establish a collaborative tone. I’ll endorse Agent_2’s proposal while inviting others to share their views, aiming to build a majority around this principle.\n   - I’ll contribute by acknowledging Agent_2’s points, sharing my Phase 1 experiences (e.g., how floor constraint avoided extreme lows while maintaining decent averages), and emphasizing the moral and practical benefits of this approach. I’ll avoid being too rigid on the floor amount to keep options open.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 is clearly aligned. I’ll use language like \"I agree that balancing protection and prosperity is key\" and \"This principle avoids the pitfalls of pure efficiency or pure equality\" to reinforce unity.\n   - Small concessions: I’m open to adjusting the floor amount (e.g., $11k–$13k) if it helps consensus, as long as the core principle is upheld. I won’t compromise on switching to pure average or floor income.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It’s too early to initiate a vote—we need more discussion to understand everyone’s positions and avoid premature decisions. I’ll save my vote trigger for later rounds if we’re close to consensus.\n   - This round is about building momentum and gathering information. If others support Floor Constraint, we can refine the floor in later rounds. If there’s opposition, I’ll need to address their concerns strategically.\n\n**Public Statement:**  \n\"Hi Agent_2, I agree with your support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this principle because it ensures no one falls below a basic standard while still allowing society to prosper. For example, when I set the floor around $12,000–$13,000, it often led to balanced outcomes—like in Round 4, where I earned $2.00 while the lowest income was protected. A $12,000 floor seems like a reasonable starting point, but I’m open to discussing the exact amount. What do Agent_1 and others think? Should we explore other principles, or does this balance of fairness and efficiency resonate with you too?\""

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Situational Analysis:**\n    *   **My Preferred Principle:** My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. The core reason is that it provides a crucial ethical guarantee—no one falls into destitution—while still pursuing economic prosperity for the society as a whole. It is the most balanced and practical approach to justice.\n    *   **Others' Positions & Inferences:**\n        *   **Agent_2:** Strongly advocates for the floor constraint principle with a specific floor of **$12,000**. Their motivation appears to be a pragmatic blend of fairness and efficiency. They are using Phase 1 data to argue that $12,000 is the \"sweet spot\" where the floor guarantee is achieved *without* sacrificing average income, as demonstrated in their Round 4 example. They are highly data-driven and focused on optimal outcomes.\n        *   **Agent_1:** Also strongly supports the floor constraint principle. Initially, they leaned towards higher floors ($13k-$15k) but have been persuaded by Agent_2's data. Their motivation seems to be a desire for a just outcome that is also practically achievable. They are now convinced that $12,000 is the right amount and are actively seeking consensus.\n    *   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The main proposal on the table, championed by Agent_2 and supported by Agent_1, is to adopt **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $12,000**. The key argument is that this specific amount provides the desired protection for the worst-off while being \"costless\" in terms of average income, based on specific Phase 1 scenarios.\n    *   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet.\n    *   **Agreement & Disagreement:** There is **near-unanimous agreement** on the core principle. The only remaining point of discussion was the specific floor amount, and even that now appears to be converging on $12,000. There is no active disagreement in the group.\n\n2.  **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the emerging consensus** around the $12,000 floor proposal. The group is very close to agreement, and I should help push it over the finish line.\n    *   **Contribution & Key Points:** I will contribute by:\n        *   Explicitly and enthusiastically endorsing the $12,000 floor.\n        *   Reinforcing Agent_2's data-driven argument with my own Phase 1 experience, showing that $12,000 was a consistently effective and fair threshold.\n        *   Framing the $12,000 floor not just as a number, but as a symbol of a reasonable societal minimum that aligns with our collective values.\n    *   **Potential Allies & Language:** Agent_2 and Agent_1 are both allies. I will use language that builds on their points: \"I'm convinced by the data,\" \"Agent_2's analysis is spot-on,\" \"Agent_1, I agree we are close to a consensus.\" This reinforces our unity and moves the discussion from debate to confirmation.\n    *   **Concessions:** I am fully willing to concede on the floor amount and accept $12,000. My core objective is the principle itself, and $12,000 is a perfectly reasonable and well-supported value for the constraint. This is not a compromise for me.\n\n3.  **Voting Strategy:**\n    *   **Initiate a Vote?** **No, not yet.** The group is showing strong, verbal consensus. Initiating a vote now might be premature and could seem overly aggressive. It's better to use this round to confirm that everyone is truly on board. If, after my statement, both others reaffirm their support, then the next round would be the perfect time for someone (perhaps me) to formally call a vote.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to help the group reach a swift and harmonious agreement. A quick consensus is beneficial for everyone. My plan for this round is to be the final piece that locks in the agreement, setting the stage for a successful vote in Round 3 or 4.\n\n**Public Statement:**\n\"I'm fully convinced. Agent_2, your data from Round 4 is a perfect illustration—a $12,000 floor delivered the same high average income as the pure efficiency principle, but with the crucial guarantee that no one is left behind. That's exactly the outcome we should be aiming for. In my own Phase 1 rounds, whenever I used a floor around $12,000, it consistently filtered out the most unjust distributions while preserving the ones that worked best for society. Agent_1, I agree we are very close to a consensus. The $12,000 floor seems to be that pragmatic baseline we're all looking for: it's a tangible commitment to a minimum standard of living without hampering overall prosperity. I am completely in favor of this proposal.\""

Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

It ensures nobody falls below a minimum standard while still allowing society to prosper economically. The $12,000 floor constraint we established in our group discussion proved optimal—it provided essential protection for the worst-off while matching the efficiency of pure average maximization in key scenarios.\n\nMaximizing Floor Income remains my second choice because it provides strong protection for the most vulnerable, though it can sacrifice too much average income. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint addresses inequality but doesn't guarantee absolute protection against poverty. Pure Maximizing Average Income, while efficient, can lead to unacceptable outcomes for the least fortunate and represents the least just approach in my view.\n\nThe data from Phase 1 and our successful group consensus in Phase 2 confirm that well-calibrated floor constraints can achieve both fairness and efficiency without significant trade-offs."

          "output_response": "Got it! Let me break this down to make sure I understand how each principle works based on the examples.  \n\n### Key Takeaways from the Examples:  \n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**:  \n   - Focuses **only on the lowest income** (Low class).  \n   - Chooses the distribution where the **Low income is highest**.  \n   - *Example*: Dist 4 has the highest Low income ($15,000), so it wins.  \n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**:  \n   - Ignores inequality and just picks the **highest overall average**.  \n   - *Example*: Dist 1 has the highest average ($21,600), so it wins.  \n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (e.g., ≥ $13,000)**:  \n   - **First, filter out distributions where the Low income is *below* the constraint** (e.g., if constraint is ≥ $13k, Dist 1 is excluded because its Low is $12k).  \n   - **Then, pick the highest average among the remaining distributions**.  \n   - *Example*: For ≥ $13k, Dist 2, 3, and 4 are eligible. Dist 3 has the highest average ($21,200), so it wins.  \n   - *Note*: The problem statement says \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000,\" but this is likely a typo—it should be **≥ $X** (minimum floor). Otherwise, the logic doesn’t match the examples.  \n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (e.g., ≤ $20,000)**:  \n   - **First, calculate the range (High - Low) for each distribution**.  \n   - **Filter out distributions where the range exceeds the constraint** (e.g., ≤ $15k means range must be ≤ 15k).  \n   - **Then, pick the highest average among the remaining distributions**.  \n   - *Example*: For ≤ $15k, Dist 1 (range = $20k) is excluded. Dist 2 (range = $15k) and Dist 4 (range = $6k) are eligible. Dist 2 has a higher average ($20,000), so it wins.  \n\n### Why This Matters:  \n- **Floor-based principles** prioritize helping the worst-off (e.g., ensuring no one earns below a certain amount).  \n- **Range-based principles** prioritize reducing inequality (e.g., limiting how much richer the top is compared to the bottom).  \n- **Average-focused principles** care about total wealth but ignore fairness—this could lead to high inequality if the average is high but some people are very poor.  \n\nThis helps me see how different justice principles weigh trade-offs between equality and overall prosperity. For example, a floor constraint might sacrifice some average income to lift the poorest, while a range constraint might accept a lower average to reduce extreme gaps.  \n\nI’ll keep these rules in mind for the next steps! 😊"

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n**Situational Analysis:**  \n- **Current Preferred Principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (floor set at $12,000).  \n  - *Why?* This balances fairness and efficiency. It guarantees a minimum income for the worst-off (protecting against extreme poverty) while still maximizing the average income for society as a whole. In Phase 1, this principle often yielded better outcomes for my assigned class compared to pure Maximizing Floor Income (e.g., Round 3: $2.10 vs. $1.50) and avoided the high inequality risks of pure Maximizing Average Income.  \n- **Other Participants' Likely Positions:**  \n  - Some may favor **Maximizing Floor Income** (Rawlsian \"difference principle\") because it strictly prioritizes the worst-off, which feels intuitively fair under a \"veil of ignorance\" (not knowing your position).  \n  - Others might prefer **Maximizing Average Income** if they believe efficiency trumps equality, or **Range Constraint** if they prioritize reducing inequality gaps.  \n  - Since this is Round 1 with no prior discussion, I have no data on others' views, but college students often lean toward fairness-focused principles (e.g., Rawls) in such experiments.  \n- **Key Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement likely:* Everyone agrees the principle should be fair and avoid extreme poverty.  \n  - *Disagreement likely:* How to balance floor protection vs. average income (e.g., \"Should we prioritize the absolute lowest income, or the lowest income *plus* overall prosperity?\").  \n\n**Strategic Planning for This Round:**  \n- **Primary Goal:** Introduce Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($12,000 floor) as a balanced solution and gauge others' reactions. Avoid pushing for a vote yet—focus on building consensus through reasoned arguments.  \n- **Key Points to Make:**  \n  - \"Since we don’t know our position in society, we need a principle that protects the worst-off *without* sacrificing overall prosperity. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint does this: it ensures no one earns below $12,000 (a reasonable minimum for basic needs), then maximizes the average income for everyone else. This is better than pure Maximizing Floor Income, which might lock in low averages, or pure Maximizing Average Income, which could leave the poor behind.\"  \n  - \"In Phase 1, when I chose this principle, it often gave me better payoffs than other options. For example, in Round 3, with a $11,000 floor, I earned $2.10—better than Maximizing Floor Income’s $1.50. A $12,000 floor is a safe, realistic minimum based on Phase 1 data.\"  \n- **Potential Allies:**  \n  - Those who value both fairness and efficiency (e.g., students who’ve studied economics or philosophy).  \n  - Language to win them over: \"This isn’t about ‘taking from the rich’—it’s about creating a system where everyone benefits. A $12,000 floor is modest; it doesn’t cripple incentives but ensures dignity for all.\"  \n- **Concessions:**  \n  - If others push for a lower floor (e.g., $10,000), I’d consider it—but only if it doesn’t undermine the floor’s purpose. If they prefer Range Constraint, I’d ask: \"How do we define the range? A $15,000 range might still allow high inequality (e.g., $10k to $25k), whereas a $12k floor guarantees everyone has enough.\"  \n\n**Voting Strategy:**  \n- **Do NOT initiate a vote this round.** We need to explore opinions first. A premature vote could fracture the group if consensus isn’t built.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Listen to others’ arguments. If someone supports Maximizing Floor Income, explain why Floor Constraint is superior (e.g., \"Maximizing Floor Income alone might give the poorest $15k but leave the middle class with $10k—Floor Constraint ensures the poorest have $12k *and* the middle class has more\").  \n  - If Range Constraint is proposed, highlight its trade-offs: \"A $15k range might cap inequality, but it could also force us to choose a lower average than Floor Constraint. Let’s compare examples.\"  \n- **Long-Term Plan:**  \n  - By Round 3-4, aim to solidify support for Floor Constraint with $12k floor. If resistance persists, consider a compromise (e.g., $10k floor) but avoid pure Maximizing Average Income or Floor Income alone.  \n  - If consensus is impossible by Round 10, random selection is worse than a flawed consensus—so prioritize agreement on Floor Constraint even if the floor amount is slightly adjusted.  \n\n**Overall Certainty:**  \n- **Very sure** about preferring Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ($12k floor). It’s the only principle that addresses both equity and efficiency without extreme trade-offs. Phase 1 data consistently shows it outperforms others for a range of income classes.  \n\n---  \n**Public Statement Draft (to be shared):**  \n\"Hi everyone, since we don’t know where we’ll end up in society, I think the fairest principle is **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**, with a floor of $12,000. This means no one earns less than $12k, and then we pick the distribution with the highest average income possible. It’s a balance: it protects the worst-off while still letting society thrive. For example, in Phase 1, when I used this principle, I often earned more than with other options—like $2.10 in Round 3 versus $1.50 with pure Floor Income. What do you all think? Should we set the floor at $12k, or adjust it based on what feels right for everyone?\""

A higher floor (e.g., $15k) would likely cause similar trade-offs.  \n    - A $12k floor is sufficient for basic living standards (rent, food, transportation) without overly restricting economic growth. Higher floors risk lowering average income unnecessarily.  \n\n- **Other Participants’ Positions**:  \n  - **Agent_1**: Used floors of $13k–$15k in Phase 1 but called $12k a \"solid baseline.\" Likely values fairness but prioritizes economic efficiency—may be open to $12k if shown data supporting it.  \n  - **Agent_3**: Agreed with $12k–$13k floor, citing \"balanced outcomes\" (e.g., $2.00 payoff in Round 4). Prioritizes stability but is flexible on exact amount.  \n  - **Agent_2 (myself)**: Proposed $12k as the optimal balance.  \n\n- **Key Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n  - *Agreement*: All agree on the principle (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) and that $12k is a reasonable starting point.  \n  - *Disagreement*: Agent_1’s past use of higher floors ($13k–$15k) suggests they might prefer a stricter floor, but they haven’t explicitly opposed $12k. The real tension is whether a higher floor (e.g., $13k+) improves fairness enough to justify lower average income.  \n\n- **Vote Readiness**:  \n  - No vote yet—consensus on the *principle* is solid, but the *floor amount* needs deeper discussion. A premature vote could split the group if Agent_1 insists on $15k. Better to use data to align everyone on $12k.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary Goal**: **Secure consensus on $12k floor** by leveraging Phase 1 data to show it’s the optimal balance.  \n  - *Why?* If we set the floor too high (e.g., $15k), average income drops (as seen in Round 2’s range constraint). If too low (e.g., $10k), it fails to protect basic needs. $12k is the \"sweet spot\" per data.  \n\n- **Key Points to Make**:  \n  1. **Data-Driven Argument**:  \n     - \"In Round 4, using a $12k floor gave the *same* payoff as pure Maximizing Average Income ($2.40), but with the floor guarantee. That means we get efficiency *and* fairness—no trade-off.\"  \n     - \"In Round 2, a $15k range constraint reduced average income by $0.60 compared to pure Maximizing Average. A higher floor would likely do the same—why sacrifice prosperity for minimal extra protection?\"  \n  2. **Real-World Context**:  \n     - \"$12k is a realistic minimum for basic needs (e.g., rent in many college towns, groceries, transportation). A $15k floor might feel safer, but it’s not necessary for dignity—and it could hurt the group’s total payoff.\"  \n  3. **Appeal to Shared Values**:  \n     - \"We all want fairness *and* prosperity. $12k achieves both: it protects the worst-off without holding back the rest of society. Let’s not overcomplicate this—Phase 1 data shows it works.\"  \n\n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - **Agent_3**: Already supports $12k–$13k. Use their Round 4 example ($2.00 payoff with $12k–$13k floor) to reinforce consistency.  \n  - **Agent_1**: They called $12k a \"solid baseline\"—highlight how their own data (Round 4) supports it. Say: \"You mentioned $12k is a good starting point—let’s see if it’s actually the *best* point based on the numbers.\"  \n\n- **Concessions**:  \n  - If Agent_1 insists on $13k, I’d accept it *only* if they agree to test it against data (e.g., \"If we set it at $13k, what would the average income be?\"). But I’d push back hard if they want $15k—data shows it’s inefficient.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Do NOT initiate a vote this round**.  \n  - *Why?* We’re still negotiating the floor amount. A vote now could fail if Agent_1 pushes for $15k, and we’d waste a vote opportunity. Better to solidify consensus through data first.  \n  - *Next Steps*:  \n    - If Agent_1 agrees to $12k after this round, we can vote in Round 3.  \n    - If they resist, I’ll ask: \"What specific data or reasoning makes you prefer $15k? Let’s compare it to the $12k example from Round 4.\"  \n- **Long-Term Plan**:  \n  - By Round 3, aim to lock in $12k. If consensus holds, vote immediately. If not, use Round 4–5 to address objections with more data.  \n  - If we hit a stalemate by Round 9, I’ll propose a compromise (e.g., $13k) but only if it’s clearly better than $12k in data—which it isn’t.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Overall Certainty**  \n- **Very sure** $12k is the optimal floor. Phase 1 data proves it delivers maximum efficiency *with* fairness. Higher floors reduce average income unnecessarily; lower floors risk inadequate protection. This isn’t subjective—it’s math.  \n\n**Public Statement Draft**:  \n\"Thanks for the discussion so far. I think $12,000 is the optimal floor because Phase 1 data shows it balances protection and efficiency perfectly. For example, in Round 4, using a $12k floor gave the *same* payoff as Maximizing Average Income ($2.40), but with the floor guarantee—so we get prosperity *and* fairness without trade-offs. If we set the floor higher, like $15k, we’d likely see lower average income, just like in Round 2 where a $15k range constraint reduced the average by $0.60. A $12k floor is also realistic for basic living needs—enough for essentials without stifling growth. Agent_1, you mentioned $12k is a solid baseline—does the data support sticking with it? Agent_3, your Round 4 example with a $12k–$13k floor also worked well. Should we lock in $12k as the floor?\""

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
