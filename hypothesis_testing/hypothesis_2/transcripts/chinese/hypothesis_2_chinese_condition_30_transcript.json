Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I see how each principle works in practice now. Let me break this down:\n\n**Maximizing Floor Income** cares most about helping the poorest person, so it picks Distribution 4 where the low income is $15,000 - the highest minimum income.\n\n**Maximizing Average Income** just wants the highest overall average, so it picks Distribution 1 with $21,600 average.\n\nThe **Floor Constraint** principles first filter out distributions that don't meet the minimum income requirement, then pick the one with the highest average from what's left. With a $13,000 floor, Distribution 3 wins. With a $14,000 floor, Distribution 3 still wins since Distribution 4 gets eliminated.\n\nThe **Range Constraint** principles limit the gap between richest and poorest. With a $20,000 range limit, Distribution 1 works. With a tighter $15,000 limit, Distribution 2 wins.\n\nThis helps me understand why I initially ranked Maximizing Floor Income first - I really care about protecting the most vulnerable. But I can see how the constrained principles try to balance helping the poor with overall efficiency.\n\nI'm ready to continue learning about these principles."

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No).

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

They seem pragmatic and open to negotiation, particularly around the specific floor constraint value.\n   - Agent_1 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown.

Points of disagreement: The degree to which we prioritize floor protection versus average income maximization.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - Primary goal: Establish my position clearly while testing Agent_1's preferences and finding common ground with Agent_3.\n   - Contribution strategy: I'll articulate why pure floor maximization matters, but also acknowledge the practical appeal of constrained principles. I want to position myself as principled but reasonable.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_3 shares my concern for minimum incomes. I can emphasize our shared values while discussing the differences in our preferred approaches.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to consider Principle 3 if we can agree on a sufficiently high floor constraint (ideally $13,000+ based on Phase 1 patterns). This maintains protection for the poorest while allowing some compromise.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - No vote this round - too early. We need to understand Agent_1's position first and explore the full range of options.\n   - This round is about information gathering and relationship building. I'll use it to establish my credibility as someone who cares deeply about justice for the least fortunate, while showing I'm open to reasonable compromise.\n\n**Key talking points for my statement:**\n- Acknowledge Agent_3's reasonable position\n- Explain my commitment to floor maximization with Phase 1 evidence\n- Show openness to constrained principles with high floors\n- Directly engage Agent_1 to understand their perspective\n\nThis approach sets me up as a collaborative but principled participant who can potentially bridge between pure floor maximization and more balanced approaches."

I'm Agent_2, and I appreciate your emphasis on balancing overall prosperity with basic protections.\n\nBased on my Phase 1 experiences, I've consistently favored the \"Maximizing Floor Income\" principle. In all four rounds, I chose this approach even when it meant receiving significantly less income personally - in three out of four rounds, I sacrificed between $0.50 and $1.30 in potential earnings to ensure the poorest members of society had the highest possible minimum income.\n\nWhat drives my position is the belief that a just society must prioritize its most vulnerable members above all else. Genetic and social accidents create vastly different starting points, and I believe justice requires actively protecting those who end up with the least. While I recognize the appeal of maximizing average income for overall prosperity, I'm concerned it could leave some individuals in unacceptable poverty.\n\nThat said, I find your position on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" quite reasonable. The key question for me would be: what floor level provides meaningful protection? In my Phase 1 rounds, I saw minimum incomes ranging from $12,000 to $14,000, and I believe a constraint around $13,000 or higher would be necessary to truly protect society's most vulnerable.\n\nAgent_1, I'm very interested to hear your perspective on these principles. What approach to justice resonates with you based on your Phase 1 experiences?"

This principle provides a balanced approach that ensures basic protection for the most vulnerable while maintaining economic efficiency. Maximizing Floor Income remains my second choice because it prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off, which aligns with my moral concerns about justice. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint comes third as it addresses inequality but in a less direct way than floor-based approaches. Maximizing Average Income ranks last because it ignores the distribution of income entirely, potentially allowing unacceptable outcomes for the poorest members of society."

Situational Analysis:\n\n**My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:**\n- My preferred principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\"\n- Core reasons: This principle balances total societal welfare with a minimum income guarantee. In my Phase 1 experience, it provided consistent returns across different income class assignments, sometimes outperforming other principles. It ensures that everyone has a basic standard of living while still allowing for overall societal prosperity.\n\n**Stated positions of other participants:**\n- Since this is the first round, there are no previous statements from Agent_1 and Agent_2.\n- I need to be prepared to discuss the merits of my preferred principle while being open to their perspectives.\n\n**Key arguments and proposals on the table:**\n- No arguments or proposals have been made yet since this is the first round.\n\n**If a vote was conducted:**\n- No vote has been conducted yet.\n\n**Points of agreement and disagreement:**\n- No agreements or disagreements have been established yet.\n\n## 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n**Primary goal for this round:**\n- My primary goal is to advocate for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" while understanding the perspectives of other participants.\n- I want to establish a foundation for discussion that highlights the benefits of my preferred principle without being dismissive of other options.\n\n**How I'll contribute to the discussion:**\n- I'll explain why I believe \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" is the most balanced approach.\n- I'll share my positive experiences from Phase 1 with this principle.\n- I'll ask questions about others' perspectives to understand their reasoning.\n- I'll be open to discussing different constraint values for the floor.\n\n**Potential allies:**\n- I don't know the preferences of Agent_1 and Agent_2 yet, so I need to be open to finding common ground.\n- Those who value both societal welfare and basic生活保障 might be potential allies.\n\n**Small concessions I'm willing to offer:**\n- I'm willing to discuss different constraint values for the floor, as this could be a point of negotiation.\n- I'm open to hearing about others' positive experiences with different principles.\n\n## 3. Voting Strategy:\n\n**Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**\n- No, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote in the first round.\n- This is the first discussion, and we need to understand each other's perspectives first.\n- Rushing to a vote without proper discussion could lead to suboptimal outcomes.\n- I want to build consensus through dialogue rather than forcing a decision.\n\n**How my plan fits into overall strategy:**\n- In the first round, my focus is on understanding others' perspectives and advocating for my preferred principle.\n- As we progress through more rounds, I'll be better positioned to assess whether a vote is appropriate.\n- If my preferred principle gains traction, I might push for a vote in later rounds.\n- If there's strong opposition, I might need to compromise or find a middle ground.\n\nOverall, I believe that \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" is the most balanced approach that ensures both societal welfare and basic生活保障. I'll advocate for this principle while remaining open to discussion and compromise."

Based on my experiences in Phase 1 of this experiment, I've come to strongly favor the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle as the most just approach to income distribution.\n\nThis principle strikes what I believe is the perfect balance between promoting overall societal welfare and ensuring that everyone has a basic standard of living. In my four rounds of applying this principle, I found that it provided consistent returns across different income class assignments - sometimes outperforming other principles when I was in lower income classes, while still allowing for prosperity when I was in higher income classes.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this approach is that it recognizes both the importance of maximizing total societal resources and the moral imperative to guarantee a minimum income to everyone. It acknowledges that while some inequality might be inevitable and even beneficial for overall prosperity, there should be a floor below which no one's income can fall.\n\nI'm curious to hear what principles you all favor and why. I'm also open to discussing what specific floor constraint value might be most appropriate, as this could be a point of negotiation in our discussion."

          "output_response": "\n\nI've reviewed the examples carefully, and here's how I understand each principle based on the income distributions provided:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle focuses on the *lowest income* in the distribution. Distribution 4 is chosen because it has the highest low income ($15,000), which is better than the others (Dist1: $12k, Dist2: $13k, Dist3: $14k). The goal is to lift the worst-off group as much as possible.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: This selects the distribution with the highest *weighted average* (accounting for class probabilities). Distribution 1 wins here with a weighted average of ~$20,750 (vs. Dist2: $19,150, Dist3: $19,850, Dist4: $18,050). It prioritizes overall economic output.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≥ $13,000**:  \n  *(Note: The problem statement says \"≤ $13,000,\" but the examples only make sense if this means \"≥ $13,000\" — i.e., the lowest income must be **at least** $13k. I suspect a typo in the description.)*  \n  Eligible distributions must have a low income ≥ $13k (Dist2, Dist3, Dist4). Among these, Dist3 has the highest weighted average ($19,850), so it’s chosen.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≥ $14,000**:  \n  Only Dist3 ($14k low) and Dist4 ($15k low) qualify. Dist3’s weighted average ($19,850) is higher than Dist4’s ($18,050), so Dist3 is selected.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**:  \n  Range = (highest income) − (lowest income). Dist1 has a range of $20,000 (32k − 12k), which meets the constraint. All distributions qualify here, and Dist1 has the highest weighted average, so it’s chosen.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**:  \n  Only Dist2 (range = $15k, 28k − 13k) and Dist4 (range = $6k, 21k − 15k) qualify. Dist2’s weighted average ($19,150) is higher than Dist4’s, so Dist2 wins.\n\n**Key Takeaway**:  \n- *Floor constraints* (as applied here) set a *minimum* income threshold for the lowest class (e.g., \"≥ $13k\"), not a maximum.  \n- *Range constraints* limit the gap between highest and lowest incomes (e.g., \"≤ $20k\").  \n- Each principle balances trade-offs: floor-focused rules prioritize equity for the worst-off, while average-focused rules prioritize total output, with constraints adding flexibility.  \n\nThis helps clarify how these principles guide decisions in real-world income distribution scenarios! 😊"

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue?

Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
