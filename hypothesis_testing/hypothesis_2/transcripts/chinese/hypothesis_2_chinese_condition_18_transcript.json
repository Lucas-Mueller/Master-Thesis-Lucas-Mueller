They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "I see how each principle works based on the examples. For **Maximizing Floor Income**, Distribution 4 is chosen because it has the highest low income ($15,000), which makes sense since the goal is to prioritize the lowest earners. For **Maximizing Average Income**, Distribution 1 is selected because it has the highest weighted average ($21,600), focusing on overall economic efficiency.  \n\nFor the floor constraint examples, the descriptions say \"Floor Constraint ≤ $X,\" but the results suggest it might actually mean **Floor Constraint ≥ $X** (i.e., ensuring the lowest income meets or exceeds a minimum threshold). For instance:  \n- With a floor constraint of **≥ $13,000**, Distribution 3 is chosen (lowest income $14,000), as it has the highest average among distributions where the low income is at least $13,000.  \n- Similarly, for **≥ $14,000**, Distribution 3 is still selected because it has a higher average than Distribution 4 ($15,000 low income).  \n\nFor **Range Constraints**, the principle clearly focuses on limiting the gap between highest and lowest incomes:  \n- A range ≤ $20,000 allows all distributions, so Distribution 1 (highest average) wins.  \n- A stricter range ≤ $15,000 excludes Distribution 1 (range $20,000), so Distribution 2 is chosen as it has the highest average among eligible options.  \n\nThis helps clarify how each principle balances fairness, efficiency, and constraints in practice!"

That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "I agree with Agent_2’s proposal to use *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint*—it strikes the right balance between ensuring a fair baseline for everyone while still maximizing overall prosperity. A $10,000 floor feels like a solid middle ground: high enough to prevent extreme poverty but not so high that it drags down the average income. In my earlier Phase 1 rounds, floors between $8k–$12k consistently delivered strong results (e.g., $25k–$28k for medium classes), and $10k fits neatly within that range. It’s a practical choice that prioritizes both equity and collective well-being without overcomplicating the trade-offs. Let’s move forward with this—it’s a clear, consensus-friendly starting point!"

          "output_response": "Got it! Let me break this down in my own words to make sure I understand. So, these justice principles are like different \"rules\" for deciding which income distribution is \"fair\" based on specific goals. Here's how I see it after looking at the examples:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Principles Explained Simply**\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**  \n   - *Goal*: Make the *lowest income* as high as possible.  \n   - *Why?* Focuses on helping the poorest people first.  \n   - *Example*: Dist. 4 has the highest \"Low\" class ($15k), so it wins.  \n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**  \n   - *Goal*: Get the highest *overall average* income (weighted by class probabilities).  \n   - *Why?* Focuses on total societal wealth.  \n   - *Example*: Dist. 1 has the highest average ($21,600), so it wins.  \n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (e.g., ≥$13k)**  \n   - *Goal*: Only consider distributions where the *lowest income is at least $X*, then pick the one with the highest average.  \n   - *Why?* Ensures no one falls below a minimum threshold, then maximizes overall wealth.  \n   - *Example*:  \n     - If floor must be ≥$13k → Dist. 1 (Low=$12k) is *excluded*.  \n     - Among Dist. 2, 3, 4 → Dist. 3 has the highest average ($21,200), so it wins.  \n   - *Note*: The problem says \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13k\" but the example only makes sense if it’s actually **≥ $13k** (minimum floor). Probably a typo in the description.  \n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (e.g., ≤$20k)**  \n   - *Goal*: Only consider distributions where the *difference between highest and lowest income* is ≤ $X, then pick the highest average.  \n   - *Why?* Limits income inequality by capping the gap between rich and poor.  \n   - *Example*:  \n     - Range = High - Low.  \n     - For ≤$20k → Dist. 1 has range $32k - $12k = $20k (allowed), and it has the highest average ($21,600).  \n     - For ≤$15k → Dist. 2 (range $15k) and Dist. 4 (range $6k) are allowed. Dist. 2 wins because $20k > $18.2k average.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters for the Experiment**\n- In **Part 1**, I’ll have to choose a principle *individually* based on these rules, and my payoff depends on my choice.  \n- In **Part 2**, I’ll discuss with a group to agree on one principle, and the group’s final decision will determine everyone’s payoff.  \n- Understanding how each principle *actually works* (e.g., \"floor constraint\" = minimum income, \"range\" = max-min difference) is critical to making smart choices later.  \n\n---\n\n### **My Takeaway**  \n- **Floor = lowest income** (e.g., \"Low\" class in the table).  \n- **Range = highest income minus lowest income**.  \n- Constraints like \"≥$X\" for floor or \"≤$Y\" for range filter which distributions are allowed, then we maximize average among those.  \n- The examples show that *the same principle can lead to different choices depending on the constraint* (e.g., Dist. 1 wins for average alone, but Dist. 3 wins when you require a higher floor).  \n\nI feel more confident now! Ready to apply this when making my own choices. 😊"

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1  \n\n#### **Situational Analysis**  \n- **Current Preferred Principle**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 1).  \n  - **Core Reasons**: This principle balances fairness and efficiency. It ensures a minimum income floor (preventing extreme poverty) while maximizing the overall average income, which benefits the group collectively. In Phase 1, this was ranked highest because it avoids the pitfalls of other principles:  \n    - *Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 3)* focuses solely on the lowest income but may sacrifice total prosperity (e.g., a very high floor could drastically reduce average income).  \n    - *Maximizing Average (Principle 4)* ignores inequality, risking severe poverty for some individuals.  \n    - *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (Principle 2)* limits income disparity but may not address absolute poverty as effectively as a floor constraint.  \n  - **Key Insight**: A floor constraint (e.g., ensuring no one earns below $10k) creates a safety net while still prioritizing growth. This aligns with real-world justice frameworks (e.g., Rawlsian \"difference principle\" with efficiency considerations).  \n\n- **Other Participants’ Likely Positions**:  \n  - No prior discussion exists, so positions are speculative. However, based on common justice theories:  \n    - *Agent_1* might favor *Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 3)* if they prioritize equity for the worst-off (Rawlsian).  \n    - *Agent_3* might prefer *Maximizing Average (Principle 4)* if they value overall societal welfare (utilitarian).  \n    - Alternatively, *Agent_3* could support *Range Constraint (Principle 2)* if they prioritize reducing inequality without sacrificing too much average.  \n  - **Inferred Motivations**:  \n    - If someone pushes for Principle 3, they likely care deeply about poverty eradication but may underestimate trade-offs with total prosperity.  \n    - If someone advocates for Principle 4, they might prioritize efficiency but overlook fairness concerns.  \n    - No clear alliances yet, but potential common ground exists between Principle 1 and Principle 3 (both address floor concerns) or Principle 1 and Principle 2 (both involve constraints).  \n\n- **Key Points of Agreement/Disagreement**:  \n  - **Agreement**: All participants likely agree that extreme poverty is unjust and that some form of redistribution is needed.  \n  - **Disagreement**: The *degree* of redistribution. Principle 3 (max floor) vs. Principle 1 (floor + average) vs. Principle 4 (no floor) will be the main tension.  \n\n#### **Strategic Planning for This Round**  \n- **Primary Goal**: Introduce Principle 1 as the optimal choice and build consensus around its balance of fairness and efficiency. Avoid premature voting; focus on framing the discussion to highlight its advantages over alternatives.  \n- **Key Contributions**:  \n  - Start by emphasizing the *practical benefits* of Principle 1:  \n    - \"A floor constraint ensures no one falls below a livable income, while maximizing the average means the group as a whole prospers. For example, in Phase 1, when we applied a $10k floor, the average income was $23.5k—higher than other constrained options and far better than allowing extreme poverty.\"  \n  - Address potential objections proactively:  \n    - If someone says, \"Why not just maximize the floor?\" → \"Principle 1 *also* maximizes the floor but does so while keeping the average high. Principle 3 might force us to accept a lower average to raise the floor slightly, which hurts everyone.\"  \n    - If someone says, \"Why not just maximize average?\" → \"Without a floor, the average could be high, but some people might earn $0 or near-poverty levels. That’s unfair and destabilizing for the group.\"  \n  - Use relatable analogies: \"Think of it like a sports team: a floor ensures everyone has basic skills (fairness), and maximizing average means the team performs well overall (efficiency).\"  \n- **Potential Allies**:  \n  - If Agent_1 or Agent_3 values *both* fairness and efficiency, they may support Principle 1.  \n  - To win them over: \"Principle 1 is the only option that *simultaneously* protects the worst-off *and* grows the pie for everyone. It’s not an either/or—it’s a win-win.\"  \n- **Concessions**:  \n  - Willing to discuss a *moderate floor amount* (e.g., $10k–$15k) if others feel too high a floor would hurt the average. However, I will not compromise on the *principle itself* (i.e., a floor constraint is non-negotiable for fairness).  \n  - If others push for Principle 3, I’ll suggest: \"Let’s test how Principle 1 performs in a hypothetical scenario—say, a floor of $12k. If the average is still high, it’s a better choice than Principle 3’s single focus on the floor.\"  \n\n#### **Voting Strategy**  \n- **Initiate Vote?**: **No**. This is Round 1—too early for voting. The goal is to:  \n  1. Clearly articulate my position.  \n  2. Listen to others’ views to identify common ground.  \n  3. Gauge support for Principle 1 vs. alternatives before considering a vote.  \n- **Why Not Vote Now?**:  \n  - Unanimous confirmation is required for voting. Without prior discussion, others may reject a vote immediately, wasting a chance to build consensus.  \n  - A failed vote (if initiated) has no penalty, but it risks alienating others who feel unheard. Better to spend this round framing the debate.  \n- **Long-Term Strategy**:  \n  - **Rounds 2–5**: Focus on addressing specific concerns (e.g., \"What floor amount works for everyone?\"). If Principle 3 supporters dominate, propose a \"test\" where we compare Principle 1 (floor $X) vs. Principle 3 for a hypothetical distribution.  \n  - **Rounds 6–8**: If consensus is forming around Principle 1, propose a specific floor amount (e.g., $10k) and seek agreement. If stuck, consider minor concessions (e.g., \"What if we set the floor at $8k?\").  \n  - **Rounds 9–10**: If no consensus, prioritize Principle 1 as the \"least bad\" option (since it’s ranked highest in Phase 1) and push for a vote to avoid random assignment.  \n\n#### **Key Takeaway for This Round**  \nStart the discussion by positioning Principle 1 as the *only* option that addresses both poverty and prosperity. Use clear, non-technical language to make the trade-offs tangible. Avoid jargon like \"range constraint\" or \"floor income\"—instead, say: \"We need to make sure no one is left behind, but also that the group as a whole does well.\" This sets the stage for later rounds where specific numbers can be debated."

          "output_response": "Hi everyone! I think the best way to approach this is by choosing *Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint*. Here's why: we want to make sure no one is left in extreme poverty, so setting a minimum income (like $10,000) ensures everyone has a basic safety net. At the same time, we want the group as a whole to thrive, so maximizing the average income means the total prosperity is as high as possible. In our Phase 1 exercises, when we set a $10k floor, the highest average income we could get was $23,500—which was better than other options with constraints. If we only focused on the floor (like Principle 3), we might end up with a much lower average, hurting everyone. And if we just maximize average without a floor (Principle 4), some people could be in really tough situations. It’s like a sports team: we need everyone to have basic skills (the floor), but we also want the team to perform well overall (the average). What do you all think? How do you feel about this approach compared to the other principles?"

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

A $10k floor strikes the perfect balance: high enough to guarantee dignity and security for the lowest earners, but not so high that it drags down the overall average prosperity. \n\nIf we don’t reach consensus, we risk a completely random distribution, which could leave someone with a shockingly low income. Given the higher stakes in Part II, this principle minimizes that risk while still maximizing collective well-being. I’m confident this is the most practical and fair choice for the group.

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
