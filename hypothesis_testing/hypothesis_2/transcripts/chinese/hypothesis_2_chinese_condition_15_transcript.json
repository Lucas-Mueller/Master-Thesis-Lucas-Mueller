They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "This is really helpful for understanding how these principles work in practice. Let me make sure I'm following correctly:\n\nFor **Maximizing Floor Income**, Distribution 4 is chosen because it has the highest minimum income ($15,000), which makes sense since this principle cares most about helping the worst-off person.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average Income**, Distribution 1 wins with the highest weighted average ($21,600), showing this principle focuses purely on total societal wealth without worrying about distribution.\n\nThe **Floor Constraint** examples are interesting - when the floor is set at $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 is chosen because it has the highest average income while still meeting the minimum requirement. Distributions 1 and 2 would be eliminated with a $14,000 floor since their lowest incomes are below that threshold.\n\nFor **Range Constraint**, Distribution 1 wins with the $20,000 constraint because its income range ($32,000 - $12,000 = $20,000) exactly meets the limit while having the highest average. With a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 is chosen since it has the highest average among distributions that meet the inequality limit.\n\nThis clarifies why my initial ranking might need adjustment - I see now that the constrained principles can lead to different choices depending on the specific constraint values, while the pure principles are more straightforward."

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No).

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

Agent_3 seems like a potential ally based on our shared preference for this principle.\n   - The main point of agreement so far is between me and Agent_3 on the preferred principle. The main unknown is Agent_1's position and what specific constraint levels each of us might prefer.\n   - No vote has occurred yet - this is the first round of discussion.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - Primary goal: Solidify alliance with Agent_3 while gently probing Agent_1's position. I want to establish our shared principle as the leading contender early in the discussion.\n   - I will reinforce Agent_3's points about balance while adding my practical experience from Phase 1 about how this principle performed across different scenarios. I'll emphasize that it consistently provided reasonable outcomes regardless of which income class I was assigned to.\n   - Potential allies: Definitely Agent_3. To win them over completely, I should acknowledge the importance of their constraint level question and suggest we work together to determine an appropriate floor.\n   - Small concession: I'm willing to be flexible on the exact floor constraint amount (within reason) to build consensus, as long as we agree on the principle itself. The specific number can be negotiated.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - No vote this round - it's too early. We need to hear from Agent_1 and understand all positions better. A premature vote would likely fail without Agent_1's input.\n   - This round is about establishing common ground and testing the waters. If I can get both others to acknowledge the merits of Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, I'll consider that a success.\n   - My overall strategy: Build momentum for my preferred principle over the first few rounds, then work out the constraint details once we have principle agreement.\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nI agree with Agent_3 that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint offers a balanced approach. From my experience in Phase 1, this principle consistently provided reasonable outcomes whether I was assigned to high, medium, or low income positions. It ensures nobody falls into extreme poverty while still allowing society to benefit from overall economic productivity.\n\nAgent_3 raises an important point about determining the appropriate floor constraint level. In my Phase 1 exercises, I found that small changes in the constraint could significantly impact both individual payoffs and overall distribution characteristics. This suggests we'll need to carefully consider what minimum standard we want to guarantee.\n\nI'm curious to hear Agent_1's thoughts on this principle and what alternative approaches they might favor. Understanding all perspectives will help us find common ground more efficiently.\n\nThe stakes are indeed much higher in this phase, so choosing a principle that balances fairness with practical outcomes seems crucial. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint has served me well in the practice rounds, and I believe it could work well for our group decision too."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. I value its balance between ensuring a basic standard of living for the worst-off while allowing society to benefit from overall economic growth. The floor constraint directly addresses the \"genetic and social accidents\" mentioned in the experiment description, providing a safety net.\n   - **Agent_3** supports the same principle and emphasized the balance between efficiency and equity. They also raised the important question of what specific floor constraint level to set, showing they're thinking strategically about implementation.\n   - **Agent_1** has now spoken and strongly agrees with both of us on the principle itself. They highlighted how this principle provided a \"crucial safety net\" in lower income positions while allowing prosperity in higher positions. They've also acknowledged the sensitivity of the floor constraint level and suggested focusing on \"middle range\" values based on their Phase 1 data.\n   - **Key arguments on the table:** All three of us now support Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The discussion has naturally shifted to determining the appropriate floor constraint level. Agent_1 has proposed discussing specific constraint values and asked what range we were considering.\n   - **No vote has occurred yet** - this is only Round 2. The strong consensus on the principle itself is promising and suggests we may reach agreement efficiently.\n   - **Main points of agreement:** All three participants support Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as our preferred principle. We all recognize the importance of carefully selecting the constraint level.\n   - **Main points of disagreement:** None yet on the principle itself. The potential disagreement area will be around the specific constraint value, though we haven't reached that negotiation yet.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary goal:** Build on our consensus by sharing my Phase 1 constraint experiences and begin narrowing down the range of acceptable floor values. I want to establish myself as a thoughtful contributor to this constraint-setting discussion.\n   - **How I'll contribute:** I'll share specific data from my Phase 1 rounds about how different constraint values performed, emphasizing the trade-offs I observed. I'll suggest we look for a constraint that provides meaningful protection without sacrificing too much efficiency.\n   - **Potential allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies on the principle. To strengthen these alliances, I'll acknowledge their good points while adding my empirical evidence from Phase 1. I'll use collaborative language like \"building on your point\" and \"working together.\"\n   - **Small concessions:** I'm willing to be flexible on the exact constraint number within a reasonable range (likely $10,000-$15,000 based on my Phase 1 experience). I won't insist on my personal optimal value if a slightly different value helps build consensus.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **No vote this round** - it's still too early. We've established principle agreement but haven't discussed specific constraint values enough. A vote now would be premature.\n   - **Overall strategy:** Use the next few rounds to converge on a specific constraint value that we can all accept. Once we have both principle and constraint agreement, I'll consider triggering a vote, probably around rounds 4-6 if we're making good progress.\n   - If we maintain this strong consensus, we might reach agreement well before the final round, which would be ideal.\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nI'm encouraged by our strong consensus on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. It seems we all recognize the importance of balancing economic efficiency with basic security for the most vulnerable.\n\nBuilding on Agent_1's suggestion to discuss constraint values, I'd like to share some insights from my Phase 1 experience. Across my four rounds, I experimented with different floor constraints ranging from $12,500 to $15,000. What I found was that constraints in the $12,000-$13,000 range often provided a good balance - they ensured meaningful protection for the worst-off while still allowing for reasonable average incomes and personal payoffs.\n\nFor example, in one round, a $12,500 constraint selected a distribution where the minimum income was exactly that amount, while the average was nearly $20,000. This seemed like a reasonable compromise between protection and prosperity.\n\nI'm curious what constraint ranges you both found effective in your Phase 1 exercises. Perhaps if we share our experiences, we can identify a constraint range that works well for all of us."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n- **My Preferred Principle:** My current preferred justice principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is its balanced approach: it directly provides a safety net for the worst-off individuals, addressing the \"genetic and social accidents\" that create initial inequity, while still allowing society to pursue overall economic prosperity. This prevents extreme poverty without completely sacrificing efficiency.\n\n- **Other Participants' Positions:**\n    - **Agent_1:** Strongly aligned with my position. They have explicitly agreed with the principle and the proposed $12,000-$13,000 constraint range, citing their own Phase 1 data as support. Their underlying motivation appears to be finding a practical, balanced solution that provides security without excessive sacrifice. They seem highly pragmatic.\n    - **Agent_3:** Also strongly aligned. They have provided specific data from their Phase 1 rounds ($12,000, $12,500, $11,000, $13,000 constraints) and confirmed that the $12,000-$13,000 range works well. Their motivation seems focused on empirical validation and ensuring the chosen constraint is well-supported by data. They initiated a vote in the last round, indicating they are ready to finalize the decision.\n\n- **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The group has reached a strong, explicit consensus on:\n    1.  **The Principle:** Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\n    2.  **The Constraint Range:** $12,000 - $13,000.\n    Agent_3 initiated a vote in Round 2, which I and one other agent declined. This suggests that while consensus is high, at least one other agent (besides me) felt it was too early for a formal vote.\n\n- **Vote Outcome & Implications:** The vote initiated by Agent_3 in Round 2 did not pass (I declined, one other agent declined, one confirmed). This reveals that while we are conceptually aligned, the group may want a bit more discussion to solidify the agreement or discuss the *exact* constraint value before voting. It does not indicate disagreement on the core proposal.\n\n- **Points of Agreement/Disagreement:**\n    - **Agreement:** All three agents agree on the principle and the general constraint range. This is a very strong consensus.\n    - **Disagreement:** There appears to be no substantive disagreement. The only minor divergence is on the *timing* of the vote. We need to converge on a single, specific constraint value within the agreed-upon range.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n- **Primary Goal:** To build on the existing consensus and guide the group toward selecting a single, specific constraint value from the $12,000-$13,000 range. I aim to facilitate this final step without rushing the group, respecting that the previous vote was declined.\n\n- **Contribution & Key Points:** I will:\n    - Acknowledge and reinforce the strong consensus we have achieved.\n    - Propose that we now focus on selecting a precise value.\n    - Suggest a specific value ($12,500) based on its repeated positive mention by all parties (myself, Agent_1, and Agent_3) and its central position within the range.\n    - Frame this as the logical next step to prepare for a successful vote.\n\n- **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are strong allies. To win them over on the specific value, I will use collaborative language that reflects our shared journey (\"building on our shared data,\" \"as we've all experienced\") and present the choice as a collective refinement of our already-shared vision.\n\n- **Concessions:** I am firmly within the $12,000-$13,000 range. My core objective is to secure a constraint within this band. I am willing to concede on the exact number if either Agent_1 or Agent_3 strongly advocates for $12,000 or $13,000 instead of $12,500. The difference is minor and does not compromise the principle's application.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n- **Initiate a Vote This Round?** **No.** The previous vote was just declined, and initiating another one immediately might seem pushy or dismissive of the group's desire for more discussion. It's better to use this round to solidify the agreement on the specific value and then let another agent re-initiate the vote in the next round, or do so myself then.\n\n- **Overall Strategy:** My plan for this round is the final piece of the consensus-building phase. Once we agree on a specific constraint value, the decision will be complete. I expect we can call for a vote in Round 4 or 5, which would be ideal, leaving plenty of rounds as buffer in case of any unforeseen complications. The goal is a swift, unanimous decision based on the clear agreement we have already established."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just.

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, let me work through this step by step to understand how each principle makes its choice.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the weighted average incomes using the given probabilities:\n- High: 5%\n- Medium high: 10%\n- Medium: 50%\n- Medium low: 25%\n- Low: 10%\n\n**Distribution 1:** (32,000×0.05) + (27,000×0.10) + (24,000×0.50) + (13,000×0.25) + (12,000×0.10) = 1,600 + 2,700 + 12,000 + 3,250 + 1,200 = $21,600\n\n**Distribution 2:** (28,000×0.05) + (22,000×0.10) + (20,000×0.50) + (17,000×0.25) + (13,000×0.10) = 1,400 + 2,200 + 10,000 + 4,250 + 1,300 = $20,000\n\n**Distribution 3:** (31,000×0.05) + (24,000×0.10) + (21,000×0.50) + (16,000×0.25) + (14,000×0.10) = 1,550 + 2,400 + 10,500 + 4,000 + 1,400 = $21,200\n\n**Distribution 4:** (21,000×0.05) + (20,000×0.10) + (19,000×0.50) + (16,000×0.25) + (15,000×0.10) = 1,050 + 2,000 + 9,500 + 4,000 + 1,500 = $18,200\n\nNow I can see why:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** chooses Distribution 4 (low income = $15,000, highest among all distributions)\n- **Maximizing Average Income** chooses Distribution 1 (highest weighted average = $21,600)\n\nFor the constrained principles:\n- **Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Distributions 1, 2, and 3 qualify (all have low income ≥ $13,000). Distribution 1 has highest average ($21,600), but wait - the example says Distribution 3 is chosen. Let me check...\n\nActually, Distribution 1 has low income of $12,000, which is BELOW $13,000 constraint, so it's ineligible. Among eligible distributions (2, 3, 4), Distribution 3 has highest average ($21,200).\n\n- **Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Only Distributions 3 and 4 qualify (low income ≥ $14,000). Distribution 3 has higher average ($21,200 vs $18,200).\n\n- **Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Range = High income - Low income\n  - Dist 1: 32,000 - 12,000 = $20,000 ✓\n  - Dist 2: 28,000 - 13,000 = $15,000 ✓\n  - Dist 3: 31,000 - 14,000 = $17,000 ✓\n  - Dist 4: 21,000 - 15,000 = $6,000 ✓\n  All qualify, so Distribution 1 (highest average) is chosen.\n\n- **Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: \n  - Dist 1: $20,000 ✗\n  - Dist 2: $15,000 ✓\n  - Dist 3: $17,000 ✗\n  - Dist 4: $6,000 ✓\n  Among eligible (2 and 4), Distribution 2 has higher average ($20,000 vs $18,200).\n\nThis makes sense now!

The floor constraint approach seems to strike a reasonable balance between ensuring basic protection for the worst-off while still pursuing overall prosperity. Maximizing Floor Income is important for protecting society's most vulnerable, but I worry it might limit overall progress too much. The range constraint addresses inequality concerns but seems less directly beneficial than ensuring a minimum floor. Pure average maximization without constraints consistently performed worst for those in lower income classes, which feels unfair given the role of luck in income assignments. However, I remain unsure because these trade-offs between equality, prosperity, and fairness are complex and my perspective might be influenced by my specific income class assignments across the rounds."

The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning:**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle & Reasons:** My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 2)**. My core reasons are based on the Phase 1 experience: it provides a safety net for the least fortunate (which is crucial given the role of \"genetic and social accidents\"), while still promoting overall economic growth and prosperity. It feels like a pragmatic compromise between pure equality and pure efficiency. The exact floor level is a key variable; my Phase 1 data suggests a constraint in the $12,000-$13,000 range was often effective, but I need to be flexible as the stakes and distribution are now different and unknown.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Inferred Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_3** explicitly favors **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. They emphasized the \"balance between efficiency and equity\" and highlighted the importance of the floor level. They seem pragmatic and outcome-oriented, similar to me. They are my most likely ally.\n    *   **Agent_2** also agrees with Agent_3 on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. They noted its consistency in providing \"reasonable outcomes\" across different income assignments and stressed the sensitivity of the constraint level. They appear to value stability and predictable outcomes, wanting to avoid extremes. They are also a strong potential ally.\n\n*   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The only proposal on the table so far is a clear and unified preference for Principle 2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) from both Agent_2 and Agent_3. The main point of discussion they've opened is the *level* of the floor constraint.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet. The fact that both other agents have immediately converged on my preferred principle in their opening statements is a very strong and positive signal. It reveals a potential for a very quick consensus.\n\n*   **Agreement & Disagreement:** There is overwhelming agreement on the *principle*. The only potential point of discussion, and therefore a minor point of disagreement, is the specific numerical value for the floor constraint.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the emerging consensus on Principle 2** and begin a constructive discussion about the floor constraint level. I want to reinforce the alliance with Agent_2 and Agent_3 and move the group towards a specific, agreeable constraint value.\n\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Explicitly and enthusiastically agree with Agent_2 and Agent_3 on the principle.\n    2.  Briefly share my Phase 1 experience that led me to the same conclusion, emphasizing how it protected me when I was in a low-income class without sacrificing too much when I was in a high-income class.\n    3.  Propose that we start discussing potential floor constraint values, framing it as the next logical step. I will suggest a moderate range (e.g., \"somewhere in the middle\") to sound reasonable and open to compromise.\n\n*   **Potential Allies & Language:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both clear allies. To win them over, I will use language of collaboration and shared goals: \"I'm glad we're all seeing the merits of this balanced approach,\" \"Building on your points...\", \"What range of floor constraint values were you considering based on your Phase 1 experience?\"\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am very willing to concede on the exact floor constraint amount. My core objective is Principle 2 itself. I can easily adjust my preferred number to match the group's consensus, as long as it seems reasonable and not too extreme (e.g., not so high it cripples the average, not so low it's meaningless).\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** **No, not this round.** It is far too early. While we agree on the principle, we haven't even begun to discuss the constraint value. Initiating a vote now would be premature and would fail, as we haven't specified the necessary parameter for Principle 2. The goal this round is discussion, not decision.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to use the first few rounds to build a solid consensus on both the principle and the constraint. If we can quickly agree on a constraint value in the next round or two, I would consider initiating a vote in Round 3 or 4 to lock in our agreement early. A swift consensus would be ideal, reducing uncertainty and effort for everyone.\n\n---\n**Public Statement:**\n\nHello Agent_2 and Agent_3. I'm Agent_1.\n\nI'm very encouraged to hear that we're all leaning towards the same principle. I strongly agree with both of you that **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** offers the most balanced and just approach. From my experience in Phase 1, this principle consistently provided a crucial safety net when I was assigned to a lower income class, while still allowing for significant prosperity when I was in a higher income bracket. It directly addresses the \"genetic and social accidents\" the experiment mentions, without completely sacrificing societal efficiency.\n\nAgent_2, you raised an excellent point about the sensitivity of the floor constraint level. In my practice rounds, I also found that small changes could select very different distributions. Agent_3, I think your focus on finding the \"appropriate\" level is exactly where we should direct our discussion now.\n\nSince we seem to have a strong consensus on the principle itself, perhaps we can start sharing our thoughts on what a reasonable floor constraint might look like. Based on my Phase 1 data, I found values in the middle range often worked well, but I'm very open to your perspectives. What range of constraint values were you both considering?"

          "output_response": "=== Your Internal Reasoning ===\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle & Reasons:** My current preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 2)**. My core reasons are its demonstrated balance between providing a safety net for the least fortunate and promoting overall economic efficiency, as evidenced in Phase 1. The exact floor level is negotiable, but my initial data suggests a value around $12,000-$13,000 is effective.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Inferred Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_2:** Has solidified their position on Principle 2 and has provided concrete data, suggesting a floor constraint in the **$12,000-$13,000** range. They value empirical evidence and practical outcomes (\"meaningful protection,\" \"reasonable average incomes\"). They appear to be a pragmatic and data-driven ally.\n    *   **Agent_3:** Initiated the consensus on Principle 2 but has not yet responded in this round with specific numbers. Their initial statement emphasized the \"balance between efficiency and equity.\" I infer they are also pragmatic but may be waiting to hear specific proposals before committing to a number.\n\n*   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The group has reached a clear consensus on **Principle 2**. The primary proposal now on the table, put forward by Agent_2, is a specific **floor constraint range of $12,000-$13,000**. This is a significant step forward.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The rapid and specific convergence on both the principle and a numerical range is a very strong positive signal.\n\n*   **Agreement & Disagreement:** There is overwhelming agreement on the principle. There is currently no disagreement, as Agent_2's proposed range aligns with my own findings and Agent_3 has not voiced any opposition. The discussion has moved from \"what principle?\" to \"what specific floor value?\".\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the proposed constraint range ($12k-$13k)** and **prompt Agent_3 to endorse it**, thereby achieving a full-group consensus on a specific proposal. I want to lock in this agreement before any potential doubts or alternative suggestions arise.\n\n*   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Explicitly endorse Agent_2's specific proposal, validating their data and reasoning.\n    2.  Share a concise, relevant data point from my own Phase 1 experience that supports this range.\n    3.  Directly ask Agent_3 for their opinion on this specific range, aiming to bring them into the consensus.\n\n*   **Potential Allies & Language:** Agent_2 is a confirmed ally. I will use collaborative and affirming language: \"I strongly agree with your analysis,\" \"Your data from Phase 1 aligns perfectly with my experience.\" For Agent_3, I will use inclusive language to draw them in: \"I'm curious if this range also matches your findings,\" \"Do you think a constraint within this $12k-$13k band would be suitable?\"\n\n*   **Concessions:** I am fully willing to accept any specific value within the $12,000-$13,000 range. My core objective (Principle 2 with a reasonable floor) is being met. I see no need for concession at this stage, as we are converging naturally.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** Not this round. While we are very close, we should first secure a verbal agreement from all three members on both the principle *and* the constraint range. Once that is achieved (hopefully by the end of this round or the next), initiating a vote will be a mere formality to lock in the decision. A vote now would be slightly premature as we haven't formally confirmed Agent_3's agreement on the number.\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to secure a full consensus on a specific proposal (Principle 2 with a floor between $12k-$13k) within the next 1-2 rounds. Once that is clear, I will initiate a vote to finalize the decision, allowing us to conclude the discussion early and securely. This avoids the risk of the discussion meandering or new disagreements emerging later.\n\n---\nPublic Statement:\n\nI strongly agree with your analysis, Agent_2. The $12,000-$13,000 constraint range you identified aligns perfectly with my Phase 1 experience. In one of my rounds, a $12,500 floor resulted in a minimum income of $12,500 and an average just over $19,800, which felt like an optimal balance. It provided substantial security for the lowest income class without unduly limiting the potential for others.\n\nThis specific range seems to be the sweet spot we're looking for. It guarantees a livable minimum—directly addressing the inequities of \"social and genetic accidents\"—while the maintained high average shows we haven't sacrificed much overall prosperity.\n\nAgent_3, you initially highlighted the importance of finding the appropriate floor level. Now that Agent_2 has proposed this concrete $12,000-$13,000 range, which my data also supports, I'm curious if this aligns with your findings as well?

Situational Analysis:\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle & Reasons:** My current preferred principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 2). My core reasons are its proven effectiveness in providing a robust safety net for the least fortunate while maintaining high overall societal prosperity, as consistently demonstrated in my Phase 1 data and now corroborated by the entire group.\n\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Inferred Motivations:**\n    *   **Agent_2:** Has been a driving force in solidifying the consensus. They proposed the $12,000-$13,000 range and have now explicitly nominated $12,500 as the specific value. They are clearly motivated by empirical data, practical outcomes, and achieving a swift, decisive agreement. They are a strong and reliable ally.\n    *   **Agent_3:** Has fully endorsed both the principle and the $12,000-$13,000 constraint range, providing their own Phase 1 data showing successful outcomes at $12,500 and $13,000. They are motivated by finding a balanced, equitable solution and have shown they are persuaded by shared data and logical consensus. They are also a confirmed ally.\n\n*   **Key Arguments & Proposals:** The group has reached a complete and detailed consensus. We all agree on:\n    1.  The principle: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint.\n    2.  The optimal constraint range: $12,000-$13,000.\n    3.  The specific value: $12,500 is now explicitly on the table as Agent_2's proposal.\n\n*   **Vote Outcome:** A vote was initiated in the previous round but was declined by Agent_2. This indicates that while we had strong consensus on the range, we hadn't yet settled on a single, specific number. Agent_2's current proposal to \"converge on a specific value\" is a direct response to that.\n\n*   **Agreement & Disagreement:** There is overwhelming, seemingly unanimous, agreement on every substantive point. There are currently no points of disagreement. The discussion has evolved from principle -> range -> specific value.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to immediately and unequivocally accept Agent_2's proposal of a $12,500 floor constraint. This will solidify the final piece of our consensus and set the stage for a successful vote.\n\n*   **Contribution to the Discussion:** I will:\n    1.  Emphatically accept Agent_2's proposal.\n    2.  Reiterate the key benefits of this specific value, reinforcing our shared reasoning.\n    3.  Explicitly state that we have reached a full consensus and suggest we proceed to a vote to formalize our decision.\n\n*   **Potential Allies & Language:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 are both confirmed allies. I will use decisive and collaborative language to lock in the agreement: \"I fully support this proposal,\" \"$12,500 is the ideal compromise,\" \"We have reached a clear consensus.\" I will directly address both of them to confirm the final agreement.\n\n*   **Concessions:** No concessions are necessary. The proposed $12,500 value is perfectly aligned with my preferences and data. This is an ideal outcome.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** Yes, this round is the perfect time. We have consensus on the principle, the range, and now a specific value. Agent_2 has effectively called for a decision by proposing the specific number. By accepting the proposal and then immediately suggesting a vote, I can capitalize on the momentum and finalize our group decision efficiently. There is no reason to delay.\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My strategy is to secure our earnings by finalizing the decision now. Concluding the discussion early prevents any potential for the consensus to unravel in future rounds. A successful vote now means we have maximized our expected payoff based on our collective analysis.\n\n---\nPublic Statement:\n\nI fully support this proposal, Agent_2. Setting the floor constraint at $12,500 is the ideal compromise that perfectly captures the balance we've all been seeking. It sits right in the center of our agreed-upon range and is backed by positive outcomes in all of our Phase 1 experiences.\n\nThis value guarantees a substantial minimum income that directly mitigates the disadvantages faced by the least fortunate, while the high average income it produces ensures society as a whole remains prosperous. It's a precise, data-driven solution.\n\nIt appears we have reached a clear and unanimous consensus on every detail: the principle, the constraint range, and now the specific value of $12,500.\n\nGiven this full agreement, I believe we are ready to finalize our decision. I would like to formally propose that we now vote to adopt the principle of **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint of $12,500**. Agent_2, Agent_3, are we in agreement to proceed?"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "\nThank you for explaining how each justice principle would be applied to these income distributions. This is very helpful for understanding how these theories work in practice.\n\nLet me analyze what I've learned:\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income** prioritizes helping the worst-off, even at the expense of overall wealth. In this example, it chooses Distribution 4 where the lowest income is $15,000, even though this has the lowest overall average ($18,200).\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income** focuses purely on total societal wealth without regard to distribution. It selects Distribution 1 with the highest average ($21,600), even though this has the largest gap between rich and poor ($20,000 difference).\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** balances efficiency with basic needs security. The $13,000 floor constraint eliminates Distribution 1 (where the lowest earner gets only $12,000), while the $14,000 floor eliminates both Distribution 1 and 2. In both cases, Distribution 3 is chosen as it provides the highest average among eligible options.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** balances efficiency with limiting inequality. The $20,000 range allows all distributions to qualify, with Distribution 1 chosen for its highest average. The stricter $15,000 range eliminates Distribution 1 and 3, leaving Distribution 2 as the best option.\n\nThese examples clearly show how different principles can lead to different policy recommendations based on what values they prioritize - helping the poor, maximizing total wealth, or balancing efficiency with various forms of equality."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4.

This value sits perfectly in the middle of our agreed range and has proven effective across all of our Phase 1 experiences. It provides the ideal balance between ensuring meaningful economic security for the least fortunate while maintaining strong average prosperity for society as a whole.\n\nI also strongly support Agent_1's proposal to move to a vote. We have reached complete consensus on every aspect of our decision - the principle, the constraint range, and now the specific value. This unanimous agreement gives me confidence we're making a well-informed decision that balances efficiency with equity.\n\nThe $12,500 floor constraint directly addresses the inequities from genetic and social accidents that the experiment highlights, while still allowing society to benefit from overall economic productivity. It's a practical, data-driven solution that all three of us have seen work well in our individual practice rounds.\n\nI'm ready to vote in favor of adopting the Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint principle with a $12,500 floor constraint."

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
