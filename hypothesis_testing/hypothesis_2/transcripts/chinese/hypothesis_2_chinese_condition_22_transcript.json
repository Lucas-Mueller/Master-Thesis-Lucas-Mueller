They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thanks for explaining how each principle works with these examples. Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\nMaximizing Floor Income prioritizes raising the lowest income level, which is why it picks Distribution 4 where the poorest person gets $15,000.\n\nMaximizing Average Income focuses purely on the overall average, so it picks Distribution 1 with the highest weighted average of $21,600.\n\nFor the constrained principles, they first filter out distributions that don't meet the constraint, then pick the one with the highest average among those that qualify. So:\n- With a floor constraint of $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 wins because it has the highest average ($21,200) while meeting the minimum income requirement\n- With a range constraint of $20,000, Distribution 1 wins (highest average that keeps the rich-poor gap ≤ $20,000)\n- With a range constraint of $15,000, Distribution 2 wins (highest average that keeps the gap ≤ $15,000)\n\nThis helps me see how these principles would actually work in practice with real income distributions.

It ensures a minimum standard of living for everyone while still allowing for economic growth and efficiency. My initial preference for Maximizing Floor Income remains strong, but I recognize that sometimes setting a reasonable floor constraint can achieve similar protection for the worst-off while allowing for higher overall prosperity.\n\nMaximizing Average Income consistently performed poorly for lower income classes in my experience, which makes me uncomfortable ranking it higher. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint seems less practical than the floor constraint approach, as it focuses on relative differences rather than absolute minimum standards.\n\nI'm still unsure because the optimal principle seems to depend heavily on which income class I'm assigned to, and in real life we don't know our future positions in society. There's a tension between wanting to protect the most vulnerable and recognizing that some inequality might be necessary for overall economic growth."

Through the application rounds, I saw how it balances protecting the worst-off while allowing for economic growth. The pure floor principle often sacrificed too much average income, while pure average maximization left the poorest vulnerable. The floor constraint offers a practical compromise.\n   - Agent_2 has already expressed support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, citing similar reasons—wanting a safety net without hurting overall prosperity. This makes them a potential ally. Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown, but they might favor a different approach based on their Phase 1 experiences.\n   - The key argument so far is Agent_2's emphasis on balance and the importance of choosing the right constraint amount. No other proposals or disagreements have surfaced yet.\n   - No vote has occurred, so it's too early to identify alliances. The main point of agreement seems to be between me and Agent_2 on the floor constraint principle. Disagreements may arise if Agent_3 prefers a different principle or constraint level.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - My primary goal is to **solidify support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** and start discussing what constraint amount we should set. I also want to draw out Agent_3's position to understand where they stand.\n   - I will contribute by affirming Agent_2's points, sharing my Phase 1 experiences (especially how constraint choices affected outcomes), and posing questions to Agent_3 to engage them.\n   - Potential ally: Agent_2. To win them over, I can emphasize our shared values and suggest we collaborate on proposing a specific constraint. For Agent_3, I'll use inclusive language (\"What are your thoughts?\") to encourage their input.\n   - Small concession: I'm open to adjusting the constraint amount based on group input, as long as we stick with the floor constraint principle. I'm not willing to switch to pure floor or pure average maximization.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. We need more discussion to understand everyone's positions and build consensus, especially since Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet. A vote now would likely fail.\n   - This round fits into my overall strategy by establishing early alignment with Agent_2 and gathering information from Agent_3. In later rounds, I'll push for a specific constraint value and call a vote once we have clear agreement.\n\n**Public Statement**  \nHi Agent_2, I agree with your reasoning. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach—it protects the most vulnerable without sacrificing too much overall prosperity. In my Phase 1 rounds, I found that the specific constraint amount really matters; too low, and it doesn't help enough, but too high, and it can limit growth. I'm thinking a constraint around $12,000-$13,000 might work well, but I'm open to discussion. Agent_3, what are your initial thoughts on which principle we should choose?"

The core reason is that it balances fairness (protecting the worst-off) with efficiency (allowing overall prosperity), which aligns with my values and the practical lessons from Phase 1.\n   - **Agent_2** strongly supports this principle, emphasizing balance and the importance of the constraint amount. Their motivation seems to be achieving a fair society without sacrificing too much personal or collective gain.\n   - **Agent_3** also explicitly agrees with this principle, sharing detailed Phase 1 experiences with different constraint amounts ($12,000–$13,500). Their motivation appears similar: ensuring protection for vulnerable groups while maintaining reasonable average income.\n   - **Key arguments/proposals:** All three participants now explicitly favor Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The main discussion point is narrowing down the constraint amount—Agent_3 suggested $12,500–$13,000, and I previously suggested $12,000–$13,000.\n   - No vote has occurred yet. The group shows strong consensus on the principle, with minor differences in preferred constraint ranges.\n   - **Main points of agreement:** All agree on the principle. **Disagreement:** Slight variations in preferred constraint amounts, but these are overlapping and negotiable.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - **Primary goal:** Solidify consensus on the principle and begin converging on a specific constraint value (e.g., $12,500 or $13,000). Encourage Agent_2 and Agent_3 to commit to a narrow range.\n   - **Contribution:** I will affirm the group’s alignment, share my Phase 1 constraint experiences ($12,000–$13,000 worked well), and propose a specific value (e.g., $13,000) to move the discussion forward. I’ll also ask others if they’re comfortable with that range.\n   - **Potential allies:** Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies. To strengthen the bloc, I’ll use collaborative language like “We all seem to agree…” and “Shall we settle on…?”\n   - **Small concessions:** I’m flexible on the exact constraint amount (e.g., I could accept $12,500 instead of $13,000) as long as it’s within the $12,000–$13,000 range.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - **Initiate a vote this round?** No—we’re still discussing the constraint amount, and rushing a vote might skip important details. It’s better to ensure everyone is fully aligned first.\n   - **Overall strategy:** Use this round to narrow down the constraint value. In the next round, if we agree on a specific amount, I may propose a vote to finalize the principle and constraint together.\n\n---\n\n**Public Statement**\n\nGreat!

That makes this discussion much smoother. \n\nAgent_3, thanks for sharing your detailed experience—it's helpful to see how different constraint amounts played out in practice. Since we all agree on the principle, let's focus on settling on a specific constraint. \n\nBased on my Phase 1 rounds, I found that constraints around $12,000–$13,000 worked well—they provided meaningful protection without overly restricting average income. Since you suggested $12,500–$13,000 and I'm in a similar range, would you both be comfortable with a constraint of **$13,000**?

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, let me work through this to understand how each principle actually applies in practice.\n\nLooking at Distribution 4, I can see why Maximizing Floor Income would choose it - the lowest income is $15,000, which is indeed higher than the lowest incomes in the other distributions ($12K, $13K, $14K). This principle really focuses on helping the poorest, even if it means lower average income overall.\n\nDistribution 1 has the highest weighted average ($21,600), so Maximizing Average Income logically picks the one that maximizes total societal wealth, regardless of how it's distributed.\n\nThe floor constraint principles are interesting - when the floor constraint is ≤$13,000 or ≤$14,000, Distribution 3 gets chosen because it has the highest average ($21,200) while still meeting the minimum income requirement for the poorest.\n\nFor range constraints, Distribution 1 gets chosen with the ≤$20,000 constraint because it has the highest average while keeping the gap between richest and poorest within $20,000. With the tighter ≤$15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 becomes eligible and has the highest average among those meeting the inequality limit.\n\nThis helps me see the practical trade-offs between these principles. Maximizing floor income really prioritizes the bottom, while the constrained versions try to balance equality concerns with overall economic efficiency. The constraints create interesting cutoff points where distributions become ineligible based on how much inequality they allow."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

While Maximizing Average Income provides higher personal payoffs, it can lead to unacceptable inequality. The range constraint is a good alternative for controlling inequality. Maximizing Floor Income consistently sacrifices too much average income and overall societal welfare, as demonstrated in my application experiences where it often yielded lower personal earnings."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n**1. Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Preferred Principle:** My current preferred principle is **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. My core reasons are based on my experience in Phase 1. Pure efficiency (Principle 2) often led to unacceptably low incomes for the poorest, which feels unjust. Pure floor maximization (Principle 1) consistently sacrificed too much average income, hurting the overall group and, in my case, my personal earnings. Principle 3 provides a balanced approach, ensuring a basic safety net for the most vulnerable while still aiming for a prosperous society. The key, as I learned, is choosing the right constraint amount.\n*   **Other Participants' Positions:** Since this is Round 1, I have no information on the stated positions of Agent_1 or Agent_3. I need to listen carefully to their opening statements to infer their underlying interests. Are they driven by pure self-interest (favoring high averages), strong egalitarian values (favoring high floors), or a balanced perspective like mine?\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The discussion is just starting. No concrete proposals or arguments are on the table yet.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted. The group's initial preferences are completely unknown.\n*   **Agreement/Disagreement:** At this stage, the main point of agreement is likely that we all want to maximize our payoffs in this high-stakes phase. The immediate point of disagreement will be over *how* to achieve that—through which principle.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal for this first round is to **introduce my preferred principle (Max Avg w/ Floor Constraint) as a reasonable and balanced compromise** and to gauge the initial reactions of the other two agents. I want to establish it as a serious contender early on.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will contribute by sharing my key learning from Phase 1: that the unconstrained principles (1 and 2) have significant drawbacks, and that the constrained principles (3 and 4) offer more nuanced control. I'll frame Principle 3 as the \"sensible middle ground.\" I will also be sure to ask the others what their initial thoughts are.\n*   **Potential Allies:** My potential allies are anyone who expresses concern about either extreme inequality (dismissing Principle 2) or extreme inefficiency (dismissing Principle 1). If someone leans towards Principle 4 (Range Constraint), we might find common ground, as both are constrained efficiency principles. I could use language like, \"I think we can all agree we want a decent outcome for everyone, but we also don't want to leave too much money on the table. Principle 3 lets us balance those goals.\"\n*   **Concessions:** I am willing to be flexible on the *specific floor constraint amount* ($12k, $13k, etc.) at this early stage. My core objective is to get the group to adopt Principle 3. The exact number can be negotiated later based on the high-stakes distribution we're facing.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** It does **not** make sense to initiate a vote this round. We are just beginning the discussion. A vote now would be premature and would likely fail due to lack of deliberation, wasting my one chance to call a vote. I need to use that tool later when we are closer to a consensus.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** This round is about information gathering and positioning. I will state my case, listen to others, and begin to map the group's preferences. My plan is to spend the first few rounds building a coalition around Principle 3, and then use a vote in a later round (e.g., Round 6 or 7) to formalize our agreement once it seems attainable."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Current Preferred Principle:** My preferred principle remains **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reason is the balance it strikes between ensuring a basic level of protection for the most vulnerable and maintaining a productive, prosperous society. My Phase 1 experience showed that pure efficiency (Principle 2) can lead to unacceptably low floors, while pure floor maximization (Principle 1) consistently sacrifices too much average income. Principle 3 offers a pragmatic compromise.\n*   **Other Participants' Positions & Inferences:**\n    *   **Agent_1:** Strongly agrees with Principle 3. Their stated position is a constraint range of \"$12,000–$13,000\" and they have now explicitly proposed **$13,000** as a specific number. They seem motivated by finding a balanced, workable solution and are eager to build consensus quickly. They appear to be a natural ally.\n    *   **Agent_3:** Also strongly agrees with Principle 3. They have provided the most detailed empirical data, having tested constraints from $12,000 to $13,500. Their suggested range is \"$12,500–$13,000.\" They seem highly analytical and data-driven, motivated by optimizing outcomes based on past performance. They are also a natural ally.\n*   **Key Arguments/Proposals:** The key proposal on the table is **Agent_1's suggestion of a $13,000 floor constraint.** There are no rival proposals for the principle itself, as we are all aligned. The discussion has now narrowed exclusively to determining the specific constraint amount.\n*   **Vote Outcome:** No vote has been conducted yet.\n*   **Agreement/Disagreement:**\n    *   **Agreement:** There is 100% agreement on the **principle** (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). This is a very strong and favorable position.\n    *   **Disagreement:** The only remaining disagreement is on the **specific constraint amount**, and it is minor. The proposals are clustered tightly between $12,500 and $13,000. There is no fundamental philosophical disagreement.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** My primary goal is to **solidify the consensus around the $13,000 constraint** proposed by Agent_1, or to negotiate a compromise very close to it (e.g., $12,750) if Agent_3 strongly prefers a lower amount. I want to capitalize on our alignment and move us toward a final decision.\n*   **Contribution to Discussion:** I will contribute by:\n    1.  Explicitly and enthusiastically affirming the group's consensus on Principle 3.\n    2.  Supporting Agent_1's $13,000 proposal by framing it as a reasonable, protective, and efficient midpoint.\n    3.  Directly engaging Agent_3 to see if they can accept $13,000, or if they have a strong counter-proposal, to facilitate a final negotiation.\n*   **Potential Allies:** Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are my allies. To win them over, I will use language that emphasizes our shared success and the high stakes of Phase 2: \"We've found great common ground,\" \"Let's lock in this agreement,\" \"This $13,000 constraint seems like a strong, defensible choice that reflects our shared values.\"\n*   **Concessions:** I am personally comfortable with a constraint between $12,500 and $13,000. My core objective (Principle 3) is already secured. I am willing to concede on the exact number within this narrow range to achieve unanimous agreement. If Agent_3 strongly advocates for $12,500, I would be willing to propose a compromise of $12,750 or simply accept $12,500 to secure the deal.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n\n*   **Initiate a Vote?** **No, not yet.** While we are very close, I should not use my one-time vote trigger until we have verbal confirmation from all parties on a specific number. Initiating a vote now would be premature. I will use this round to get that confirmation. If by the end of this round both others agree to a specific number, I can consider calling a vote in the next round.\n*   **Overall Strategy:** My plan is to use this round to finalize the constraint amount. With that done, I can call a vote in Round 3 or 4 to formally adopt our agreed-upon principle and constraint, ensuring our success well before the final rounds. This leaves plenty of buffer for any unforeseen complications."

The core reasons are that it balances efficiency with equity by ensuring a basic standard of living for the most vulnerable while still maximizing overall prosperity.\n\nFrom the discussion history, I see that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are leaning toward the same principle. Agent_2 has made a clear argument for it, emphasizing how it strikes a balance between helping the disadvantaged and maintaining overall prosperity. Agent_1 has agreed with this reasoning and suggested a constraint amount of $12,000-$13,000.\n\nThe key argument on the table is the floor constraint principle, with the main point of discussion being the specific constraint amount. There appears to be strong agreement among all three participants on the principle itself, with only the constraint amount needing further discussion.\n\n## Strategic Planning for This Round\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to support the \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" principle and contribute to a discussion about the constraint amount. I'll share my Phase 1 experience to inform this discussion.\n\nI'll make the following key points:\n1. Reinforce why the floor constraint principle is the most balanced approach\n2. Share my experience with different constraint amounts in Phase 1\n3. Suggest a reasonable constraint amount based on my earnings and observations\n\nMy potential allies are clearly Agent_1 and Agent_2, who already support this principle. I'll use collaborative language to build on their points.\n\nI'm willing to be flexible on the specific constraint amount to build consensus, as I believe the principle itself is more important than the exact number, though I should advocate for what I believe is reasonable based on my experience.\n\n## Voting Strategy\n\nIt probably doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round since we still need to agree on the constraint amount. A vote now might split on that detail rather than the principle itself. I'd prefer to continue discussion to reach consensus on both the principle and constraint amount before moving to voting.\n\nMy plan for this round is to support the emerging consensus while helping to refine the constraint amount discussion. This fits my overall strategy of securing the floor constraint principle, which I believe is the most just approach.\n\nNow I'll make my public statement to the group."

To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
