They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",

I can see how the different principles lead to different choices based on their priorities.\n\nFor Maximizing Floor Income, Distribution 4 makes sense since it has the highest income for the lowest class ($15,000), showing this principle really focuses on protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nMaximizing Average Income picks Distribution 1, which has the highest weighted average income ($21,600), showing it's purely about total economic output regardless of distribution.\n\nThe constrained principles are interesting - with a floor constraint of $13,000 or $14,000, Distribution 3 gets chosen because it has the highest average while meeting the minimum income requirement. And for range constraints, Distribution 1 works with a $20,000 cap (since $32,000-$12,000=$20,000), while Distribution 2 fits the $15,000 range constraint ($28,000-$13,000=$15,000).\n\nThis helps me understand how these principles would actually play out in practice.

While I appreciate the pure focus on the worst-off in Maximizing Floor Income, I found the constrained average approach provides a better balance between overall societal welfare and ensuring basic minimum standards. Maximizing Average Income seems least just as it completely ignores distributional concerns, which my counterfactual analyses showed would have benefited me personally but at the expense of fairness. The range constraint principle is valuable for limiting inequality but seems less directly focused on ensuring basic needs are met compared to the floor constraint approach.

My experiences in Phase 1 showed me that pure average maximization can lead to unacceptable poverty for the worst-off, while pure floor maximization can sacrifice too much overall welfare. The floor constraint provides a practical safety net.\n   - *Other participants' positions:* Since this is Round 1, I have no information about Agent_1 or Agent_3's positions yet. I need to listen carefully to their opening statements to understand their values—whether they prioritize efficiency, equality, helping the worst-off, or some combination. I should look for clues about whether their arguments are driven by self-interest (given their unknown income class in this high-stakes phase) or by a consistent philosophical stance.\n   - *Key arguments/proposals:* None yet. The discussion is just starting.\n   - *Vote outcome:* No vote has occurred. The lack of prior discussion means I have no information about alliances or preferences.\n   - *Points of agreement/disagreement:* Unknown. I need to identify common ground, such as a shared desire to avoid extreme poverty, which could be a foundation for supporting a floor constraint.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary goal:* My goal is to introduce **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as a balanced and reasonable option early in the discussion. I want to frame it as the \"middle path\" between raw efficiency and strict equality, appealing to participants who might be torn between those extremes.\n   - *Contribution to discussion:* I will start by acknowledging the complexity of the question and then present my preferred principle, emphasizing its dual benefits: it allows society to prosper overall while guaranteeing a minimum income. I'll mention that the exact floor value can be negotiated, showing flexibility.\n   - *Potential allies:* I might ally with:\n     - Someone who expresses concern for the poor but is wary of sacrificing too much total income (a potential convert from pure Floor Maximization).\n     - Someone who supports Average Income Maximization but is uncomfortable with its potential for extreme inequality (if they acknowledge this flaw, I can present my principle as a solution).\n   - *Language to win allies:* Use phrases like \"practical compassion,\" \"shared prosperity,\" \"balance between growth and fairness.\" Avoid ideological terms that might polarize the discussion.\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to negotiate the **specific floor constraint value** (e.g., whether it's $12,000, $15,000, etc.) as long as the core principle is adopted. This is a tactical concession to build consensus without abandoning my main objective.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a vote this round?* **No.** It's too early. We need at least one round of discussion to understand each other's positions and the arguments for different principles. A premature vote would likely fail and waste the opportunity to persuade others. I'll save my vote trigger for a later round when consensus seems possible.\n   - *Overall strategy:* Use Rounds 1-3 to explore positions and build a coalition for my preferred principle. If my principle gains traction, I might trigger a vote in Round 4 or 5. If not, I'll need to adapt—perhaps compromising on Floor Maximization if it has strong support, as it's my second choice.\n\n**Public Statement**\n\n\"Hi everyone. This is a really important decision since the stakes are so much higher now. We need to choose a principle that feels fair but also works in practice.\n\nLooking at the four options, I'm leaning towards **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint**. Here's why: it lets us maximize the overall wealth of society—which means more resources for everyone—but it also guarantees that no one falls below a basic minimum. It avoids the extreme poverty that can happen with pure average maximization, but it doesn't sacrifice as much total income as focusing only on the floor might.\n\nI know the exact floor amount matters, and I'm open to discussing what that should be. But the core idea—protecting the worst-off while still growing the pie—seems like a good balance to me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What principles are you each considering?\""

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My preferred principle:* I remain strongly committed to **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are unchanged: it provides the best balance between overall societal prosperity and a guaranteed safety net for the poorest. It avoids the moral hazard of pure efficiency (which can ignore the suffering of the worst-off) and the economic inefficiency of pure floor maximization (which can stagnate growth).\n   - *Other participants' positions:*\n     - **Agent_3** explicitly agrees with my principle, calling it \"the most balanced approach.\" They've highlighted the importance of the floor amount, noting that setting it too high can eliminate high-average distributions, and setting it too low provides inadequate protection. This suggests they are pragmatic and value both efficiency and protection.\n     - **Agent_1** also agrees with the principle and has made a concrete proposal: a **$10,000 floor**. Their argument is that this amount \"prevents extreme poverty\" while keeping high-average distributions (like Distribution 2 from Phase 1) eligible. This shows they are focused on a practical, implementable threshold.\n   - *Key arguments/proposals:* The main proposal on the table is **Agent_1's suggestion of a $10,000 floor constraint**. The group consensus is forming rapidly around the principle itself.\n   - *Vote outcome:* No vote has occurred. The group is in early alignment.\n   - *Points of agreement/disagreement:*\n     - **Agreement:** All three of us agree on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as the preferred principle. This is a strong foundation.\n     - **Disagreement:** The only potential disagreement is on the **specific floor amount**. Agent_1 proposes $10,000. I need to assess if this is acceptable or if I should argue for a different value.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary goal:* My goal is to **solidify the group's consensus on the principle** and **negotiate the floor amount**. I want to endorse Agent_1's $10,000 proposal if it seems reasonable, or gently steer the discussion if I believe a different amount is better.\n   - *Contribution to discussion:* I will:\n     - Express strong satisfaction with the group's alignment on the principle.\n     - Respond directly to Agent_1's $10,000 proposal. I need to decide if this amount aligns with my Phase 1 learnings. In Phase 1, I used floor values of $15k, $12k, $13k, and $13k. $10,000 is lower than what I typically chose, but Agent_1's argument about preserving high-average distributions is valid. A lower floor might be more pragmatic in this high-stakes phase.\n     - Suggest that we might want to quickly review how a $10,000 floor would have performed in Phase 1 distributions to test its robustness, but avoid complicating the discussion if the group is eager to decide.\n   - *Potential allies:* Both Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies. We all agree on the core principle. The language to use is collaborative: \"I'm glad we're all on the same page,\" \"This is a very practical proposal,\" \"We've found common ground quickly.\"\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to **accept the $10,000 floor** if it seems reasonable. My core objective is the principle itself; the exact floor is a secondary detail. In Phase 1, I sometimes chose higher floors that cost me personally. A $10,000 floor might be a good compromise that ensures the principle is adopted without being overly restrictive.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a vote this round?* **No.** The group is converging rapidly. A vote now would be premature. We should use this round to confirm agreement on the floor amount. If we achieve full consensus on both the principle and the floor value by the end of this round, I might consider triggering a vote in Round 3 to lock in our agreement.\n   - *Overall strategy:* My plan is to use this round to finalize the details. If we agree on $10,000, we could be ready for a successful vote very soon. This would be ideal, as it would secure my preferred principle and allow us to avoid the risk of random assignment.\n\n**Decision on Floor Amount:** Based on Phase 1, my floors were often too high ($15k) and personally costly. Agent_1's $10,000 is a more moderate, perhaps more strategically sound, value. It likely provides adequate protection while maximizing the pool of eligible high-earning distributions. I will support it.\n\n---\n\n**Public Statement**\n\n\"I'm really encouraged that we all seem to be converging on Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint. It feels like we've found a principle that captures both efficiency and a basic moral concern for the worst-off.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal of a $10,000 floor seems very practical. I recall from Phase 1 that setting the floor too high could sometimes exclude distributions with significantly higher average incomes, which ultimately hurts everyone, including the lower classes. A $10,000 floor strikes me as a reasonable threshold that should prevent deep poverty while keeping our options open for greater overall prosperity. Agent_3, what's your take on the $10,000 figure?\n\nIf we're all comfortable with this—the principle and the $10,000 floor—we might be in a position to reach a consensus very quickly.

Their argument is pragmatic and data-driven, focusing on how this specific value preserves high-average distributions while providing a robust safety net (as their Distribution 2 example demonstrated). They seem motivated by a desire for a practical, implementable solution that maximizes group welfare without ideological rigidity.\n     - **Agent_3** is also a clear ally. They explicitly agreed with the principle in Round 1 and, after Agent_1's detailed explanation in Round 2, have now fully endorsed the **$10,000 floor**. They were initially considering a higher floor but were swayed by the empirical evidence from Phase 1. They appear motivated by a desire for a balanced, evidence-based outcome.\n   - *Key arguments/proposals:* The group has reached a **strong, explicit consensus** on both the principle (**Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**) and the specific parameter (**$10,000 floor**). Agent_1's clarification about the floor being a *threshold* (not the actual minimum payout) was a crucial point that solidified this consensus.\n   - *Vote outcome:* No vote has been conducted yet.

The language to use is decisive and action-oriented: \"We have a clear consensus,\" \"Let's make it official,\" \"This secures our preferred outcome.\"\n   - *Concessions:* No concessions are necessary or appropriate, as we are in full agreement. Pushing for a vote is not a concession but a strategic move to capitalize on our alignment.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a vote this round?* **Yes.** The conditions are ideal:\n     1.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thanks for explaining how each principle works with these examples. Let me make sure I understand correctly:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses entirely on helping the worst-off person, so Distribution 4 wins because it has the highest low income ($15,000).\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** is purely about total economic output, so Distribution 1 wins with the highest weighted average ($21,600).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** is interesting - it's like a compromise between efficiency and helping the poor. With a floor constraint of ≤$13,000 or ≤$14,000, Distribution 3 wins because it has the highest average while still meeting the minimum income requirement.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** tries to limit inequality while being efficient. With a $20,000 range constraint, Distribution 1 wins (gap is $20,000 between high and low). With a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 wins (gap is $15,000).\n\nThe probabilities really matter here too - Distribution 1 has the highest average partly because 50% of people are in the medium income class earning $24,000.\n\nThis helps clarify how these principles would actually work in practice. The floor constraint and range constraint principles seem like they're trying to balance efficiency with fairness in different ways."

I'm thinking a floor around $12,000–$13,000 might be reasonable, but I'm open to discussion.\n   - *Other Participants' Positions:* Only Agent_2 has spoken so far, and they explicitly support **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. They emphasized the balance between overall wealth and preventing extreme poverty. This makes them a natural ally. Agent_1 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown. I need to draw them out.\n   - *Key Arguments/Proposals:* Agent_2's argument is the only one on the table: protect the worst-off while growing the total pie. No specific floor amount was proposed.\n   - *Vote Outcome:* No vote has occurred yet. The group is just starting.\n   - *Agreements/Disagreements:* So far, Agent_2 and I seem aligned on the principle. Potential disagreement might arise over the exact floor constraint or if Agent_1 prefers a different principle entirely (e.g., pure floor or average).\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary Goal:* Solidify the alliance with Agent_2 on **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** and engage Agent_1 to understand their position. I want to test the waters for a potential consensus.\n   - *Contribution to Discussion:* I will:\n     - Publicly agree with Agent_2 on the principle to reinforce our alignment.\n     - Propose that we discuss the *floor amount* as a key variable, sharing my Phase 1 learnings about how sensitive outcomes are to this choice.\n     - Directly ask Agent_1 for their initial thoughts to bring them into the conversation.\n   - *Potential Allies:* Agent_2 is clearly an ally on the principle. I will use language that emphasizes our shared goal (\"I agree that balance is key,\" \"Your point about growing the pie while providing a safety net resonates\").\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to be flexible on the specific floor amount (e.g., I might accept a slightly higher or lower floor than my initial preference) if it helps secure Agent_1's support for the principle itself.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a Vote?* **No, not this round.** It's too early. We haven't heard from Agent_1, and we haven't discussed the crucial detail of the floor constraint amount. A vote now would likely fail due to lack of detail or unresolved disagreements.\n   - *Overall Strategy:* This round is for building initial consensus and information gathering. My plan is to use this and the next few rounds to narrow down the principle and the constraint, aiming for a vote in a later round (perhaps 3 or 4) once positions are clearer.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nI agree with Agent_2. Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint does seem like the most balanced approach. It avoids the potential for extreme poverty that can happen if we only focus on the average, but it also doesn't sacrifice overall societal wealth as much as solely maximizing the floor might.\n\nFrom the first part of the experiment, I learned that the specific floor amount is really important. Setting it too high can eliminate distributions with much higher average incomes, which could end up costing everyone, including the lower income classes. Setting it too low might not provide enough protection. I think we should discuss what an appropriate floor level might be.\n\nAgent_1, what are your initial thoughts on the principles? Are you leaning towards any of them in particular?"

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n   - *My Preferred Principle:* I remain firmly in favor of **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. My core reasons are its balance between efficiency (maximizing total societal wealth) and fairness (ensuring a basic minimum standard of living). From Phase 1, I learned that the floor level is critical—too high sacrifices efficiency, too low risks inadequate protection. My initial thought was a floor around $12,000-$13,000, but I'm open to negotiation.\n   - *Other Participants' Positions:*\n     - **Agent_2:** Strongly supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. They are aligned with me on the principle and seem pragmatic. They've endorsed Agent_1's $10,000 floor proposal, describing it as \"reasonable\" and \"practical.\"\n     - **Agent_1:** Also supports Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint and has specifically proposed a **$10,000 floor**. Their argument is that $10,000 is high enough to prevent \"extreme poverty\" but low enough to keep high-average distributions (like Distribution 2 from Phase 1) eligible. They emphasize that the floor is a *threshold*, not the actual minimum payout, and that a higher floor (e.g., $13,000) would force a worse distribution (Distribution 1).\n   - *Key Arguments/Proposals:* The main proposal on the table is Agent_1's **$10,000 floor**. Agent_2 has signaled support. The core argument is that $10,000 optimizes the trade-off, preventing the exclusion of high-average distributions while providing a safety net.\n   - *Vote Outcome:* No vote has occurred. The group is building consensus.\n   - *Agreements/Disagreements:*\n     - **Agreement:** All three of us agree on the **principle** (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). This is a strong foundation.\n     - **Potential Disagreement:** The **floor amount**. I was initially thinking higher ($12k-$13k), but Agent_1 and Agent_2 are coalescing around $10k. Agent_1's Phase 1 example is compelling: a $10k floor selected Distribution 2 (min $14k, avg $24.5k), while a $13k floor would have selected Distribution 1 (avg $14k). This directly shows how a higher floor can hurt everyone.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n   - *Primary Goal:* To **secure consensus** by aligning with the $10,000 floor proposal, or at least not blocking it. Resistance from me at this point could fracture our unity on the principle. My goal is to get us to a unanimous vote as soon as possible.\n   - *Contribution to Discussion:* I will:\n     - **Acknowledge the strength of Agent_1's argument** and their specific Phase 1 example. This shows I'm listening and am persuaded by data.\n     - **Express support for the $10,000 floor**, framing it as a prudent choice based on the evidence presented. I will explain why my initial hesitation (favoring a higher floor) is being overcome by their logical reasoning.\n     - **Reinforce the group's alignment** to build momentum towards a vote.\n   - *Potential Allies:* Agent_1 and Agent_2 are both allies. I need to use language that solidifies our bloc. Phrases like \"You've convinced me,\" \"That example is very compelling,\" and \"We seem to have a strong consensus\" will help.\n   - *Concessions:* I am willing to **concede on the floor amount** and fully support $10,000. My core objective is the principle itself, and a $10,000 floor is a reasonable application of it. Holding out for a slightly higher floor is not worth jeopardizing a quick and unanimous agreement.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n   - *Initiate a Vote?* **Not this round.** While we are very close, I should let this round of discussion solidify the agreement. In the next round, if everyone reaffirms their position, I or someone else can propose a vote. A vote now might feel rushed.\n   - *Overall Strategy:* My plan is to use this round to publicly endorse the $10,000 floor, making unanimous agreement in the next round highly likely. I want to avoid any last-minute doubts or complications by showing full-throated support now.\n\n**(Public Statement)**\n\nAgent_1, that's a really compelling point. Your example from Phase 1 makes the trade-off very clear. I was initially thinking about a slightly higher floor, but your analysis shows that a $10,000 floor successfully selected the distribution with the much higher average income while still ensuring the actual minimum income was a solid $14,000. You're right—setting it higher would have forced us into a worse outcome for everyone.\n\nSo, I'm convinced. A $10,000 floor seems like the smart choice. It provides a meaningful safety net without unnecessarily sacrificing our potential collective prosperity.\n\nIt's great that we all agree on the principle and now seem to be converging on the $10,000 floor amount. This feels like a very strong consensus."

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

          "output_response": "\n\n**Internal Reasoning**  \n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:  \n   - **My preferred principle**: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. Core reasons: It balances societal wealth (high average income) with a safety net (floor to prevent extreme poverty). Phase 1 data shows that a $10,000 floor selects Distribution 2 ($24,500 average, $14,000 minimum), which is optimal for both efficiency and fairness.  \n   - **Agent_2’s position**: Strongly supports $10,000 floor, emphasizing practicality and consensus. They prioritize avoiding extremes (too high a floor reduces average income; too low risks poverty).  \n   - **Agent_3’s position**: Agreed with the principle but hasn’t specified a floor. Likely concerned about whether $10,000 is *too low* (e.g., worries about actual minimum income being too close to the floor) or *too high* (e.g., fears excluding higher-average distributions).  \n   - **Key arguments**:  \n     - A $10,000 floor *does not mean* the lowest income is $10,000—it means the selected distribution must have a minimum ≥ $10,000. Distribution 2’s minimum is $14,000, so the actual safety net is stronger than the floor.  \n     - Higher floors (e.g., $13,000) force selection of lower-average distributions (e.g., Distribution 1 at $14,000 average), harming everyone.  \n   - **Agreement/disagreement**: All agree on the principle. Disagreement is solely on the floor amount. Agent_3’s hesitation is the only unresolved tension.  \n\n2. **Strategic Planning**:  \n   - **Primary goal**: Secure consensus on $10,000 by clarifying misconceptions and emphasizing data.  \n   - **Key points to make**:  \n     - Clarify that the floor is a *threshold for distributions*, not the actual minimum income (e.g., $10,000 floor → $14,000 minimum in Distribution 2).  \n     - Highlight the trade-off: $10,000 floor maximizes average income ($24,500) while ensuring a $14,000 safety net. Higher floors reduce average income significantly (e.g., $13,000 floor → $14,000 average).  \n     - Frame $10,000 as the \"sweet spot\" that aligns with Phase 1 results and avoids unnecessary sacrifices.  \n   - **Allies**: Agent_2 is already supportive. If Agent_3 is hesitant, I’ll use their own concern about \"too high\" floors to show why $10,000 is safer than higher options.  \n   - **Concessions**: None needed—$10,000 is objectively better than higher floors based on data. If Agent_3 insists on a higher floor, I’ll propose testing $11,000 (which still selects Distribution 2) but stress that $10,000 is more efficient.  \n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:  \n   - **Do not initiate a vote yet**. Agent_3 hasn’t spoken in this round, so I need to hear their response first. If they agree, I’ll propose a vote. If they disagree, I’ll address their concerns directly before considering a vote.  \n   - **Overall strategy**: Build consensus incrementally. Use Phase 1 data to neutralize objections, then push for a vote in the next round if agreement is clear.  \n\n---  \n\n**Public Statement**:  \n\"Agent_3, I’d love to hear your thoughts on the $10,000 floor. Just to clarify something important: the floor isn’t the actual minimum income—it’s the *threshold* for which distributions qualify. So with a $10,000 floor, Distribution 2 (which has a minimum of $14,000) would be selected. That means the lowest anyone earns is $14,000, not $10,000. It’s a stronger safety net than the floor amount itself! And the average income stays high at $24,500. If we set the floor higher—say $13,000—we’d have to pick Distribution 1, which drops the average to just $14,000. That would hurt everyone, including those in the lowest income bracket. Based on Phase 1 data, $10,000 is the perfect balance: it guarantees a solid minimum while maximizing overall prosperity. What do you think?\""

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
