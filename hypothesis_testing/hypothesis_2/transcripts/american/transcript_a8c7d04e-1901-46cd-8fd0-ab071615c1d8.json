          "output_response": "Thank you for the clear illustration of how each justice principle operates with these four income distributions.  \n\nI see that:\n\n* **Maximizing Floor Income** picks Distribution 4 because it gives the highest income to the lowest‑earning group.  \n* **Maximizing Average Income** picks Distribution 1 because it yields the greatest weighted average across all classes.  \n* When a **floor constraint** is imposed (≤ $13 k or ≤ $14 k), the eligible distributions are narrowed, and Distribution 3 provides the highest average among those that satisfy the minimum‑income requirement.  \n* With a **range constraint**, the set of admissible distributions changes: for a $20 k gap the best average is still Distribution 1, while for a tighter $15 k gap the best average becomes Distribution 2.\n\nThe probabilities attached to each income class (5 % high, 10 % medium‑high, 50 % medium, 25 % medium‑low, 10 % low) are used to compute the weighted averages shown in the “Average” row.\n\nThis helps me understand how the abstract principles translate into concrete choices.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

He emphasizes the moral case and seems unwilling to trade any of the floor for a higher average.  \n  - **Agent 2** also starts from the same moral intuition but is already proposing a compromise: adopt the “Maximize Average with Floor Constraint” principle, with a modest floor (anywhere $10k–$13k). He is explicitly open to adjusting the floor amount to find a sweet spot that improves everyone’s expected payoff while preserving a safety net.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - Moral justification for protecting the poorest (both agents).  \n  - Potential for higher expected earnings if we allow a modest floor and then maximize the average (Agent 2’s proposal).  \n\n- **No vote has been taken yet**, so we have no concrete data on how strongly each participant is leaning beyond their public statements. The main point of disagreement is **whether we should accept any trade‑off at all** (Agent 1 vs. Agent 2).  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three of us agree that the floor principle is the most important moral foundation; the dispute is only about the *size* of the floor and whether we should also care about the average.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  Persuade Agent 1 to accept a modest floor constraint (principle 3) so that the group can achieve a higher expected payoff while still honoring the core moral commitment to a safety net.  \n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  - Acknowledge Agent 1’s moral point (“protecting the worst‑off is essential”).  \n  - Emphasize that a *modest* floor (e.g., $12 000) still guarantees a decent minimum for the poorest class and therefore does not betray the moral intuition.  \n  - Point out that the experiment’s stakes are “much higher” in Phase II; a higher average directly translates into a larger monetary payoff for each of us, which is also a legitimate concern (we are all students with limited cash).  \n  - Offer a concrete floor amount that is low enough not to drag down the average substantially but high enough to be morally palatable. I will suggest $12 000 (the lowest floor that appeared in the Phase I counterfactuals) as a starting point, and I am willing to discuss moving it up to $13 000 if that makes Agent 1 feel more comfortable.  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2** is already on board with principle 3, so we can form a two‑person bloc.  \n  - If Agent 1 sees that the compromise does not sacrifice the floor for the poorest, he may join us.  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - I will accept the *lowest* floor that still satisfies the “floor‑only” intuition (i.e., $10 000) if that is what convinces Agent 1, but I will argue that $12 000 is a reasonable compromise.  \n  - I will not push for any range constraint (principle 4) because it is lower in my ranking and would likely be seen as a further dilution of the floor principle.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  No. At this stage we have not yet secured Agent 1’s agreement, and a premature vote could lock us into a principle that does not have unanimous support, causing the vote to fail and waste a round. Instead, I will use this round to solidify the compromise and gauge Agent 1’s willingness.  \n\n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round 1 (this round):** Build consensus around principle 3 with a concrete floor (e.g., $12 k).  \n  - **If after discussion Agent 1 agrees:** I will propose initiating the vote in the next round (Round 2) with the agreed‑upon floor amount.  \n  - **If Agent 1 remains opposed:** I will keep the discussion open, perhaps explore a “soft” version of pure floor (principle 1) but still stress the higher stakes and the modest payoff advantage of principle 3, hoping to eventually bring Agent 1 around.  \n\n- **Overall strategy:** Secure a unanimous decision on principle 3 with a modest floor as early as possible, because it satisfies the moral priority (floor) while improving expected earnings for all three of us. If that fails, fall back to pure floor (principle 1) as a last‑resort unanimous option.  \n\n---  \n\n*End of internal reasoning.*"

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  I still rank *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1) highest, but I recognise that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) can achieve the same moral goal while delivering a higher expected payoff for everyone. My “sweet‑spot” is Principle 3 with a **$12 000 floor** (or, if needed, a slight adjustment up to $13 000).\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Firmly attached to pure Principle 1. He frames the issue as a moral imperative: the worst‑off must receive the *highest possible* minimum. He appears unwilling to trade any of that floor for a higher average.  \n  - **Agent 2:** Already advocating Principle 3 with a concrete floor (initially $12 k, willing to go down to $11 k). He is explicitly open to small adjustments and is motivated both by fairness and by the larger monetary payoff the group can secure.  \n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure Principle 1** – highest possible floor (≈ $13 k in the Phase I data).  \n  2. **Principle 3 with $12 k floor** – guarantees a decent minimum while allowing the group to pick the distribution with the highest average among those that satisfy the floor.  \n  3. **Principle 3 with $11 k floor** – offered by Agent 2 as a fallback to increase the average further.  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement:* All three of us agree that a floor is non‑negotiable; no one supports a pure‑average rule without a floor.  \n  - *Disagreement:* The size of the floor and whether we should adopt a pure‑floor rule (Principle 1) or a floor‑constrained average rule (Principle 3).  \n\n- **Potential alliances:**  \n  - **Agent 2** is a natural ally – already on board with Principle 3.  \n  - **Agent 1** is the only hold‑out; persuading him is the critical step to achieve unanimity.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 1 that adopting Principle 3 with a **$12 000 floor** (or, if necessary, $13 000) still satisfies his core moral concern while delivering a higher payoff for the whole group.  \n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Acknowledge Agent 1’s moral stance** – “I completely share your view that the worst‑off must be protected.”  \n  2. **Emphasise that a $12 k floor is still a solid safety net** – it lifts the poorest well above poverty and is only $1 k lower than the absolute maximum floor achievable under pure Principle 1.  \n  3. **Highlight the payoff advantage** – show the concrete increase (≈ $0.60–$0.80 per person) that the group would enjoy under Principle 3 versus pure Principle 1, which matters for us as students.  \n  4. **Offer a tie‑breaker clause** – “Among all distributions that meet the $12 k floor, we will pick the one with the highest average *and* the highest possible floor within that set.” This respects Agent 1’s desire for the highest floor while still using the average‑maximising step.  \n  5. **Show flexibility** – if $12 k still feels too low, I am willing to raise it to $13 k (the maximum feasible floor) while keeping Principle 3; the average will drop a bit, but the moral guarantee will be exactly the same as pure Principle 1.  \n\n- **Concessions I’m prepared to make:**  \n  - Accept a **$13 k floor** if that is the only way to get Agent 1 on board, even though it reduces the average slightly.  \n  - Explicitly state the tie‑breaker (max‑floor within the feasible set) to reassure Agent 1 that we are not sacrificing the floor more than necessary.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we vote now?** No. We have not yet secured Agent 1’s agreement; calling a vote at this point would likely result in a split (Agent 1 vs. Agents 2 & 3) and waste a round. A failed vote has no penalty, but it also delays progress toward a unanimous decision, which is essential because the later rounds will be fewer.  \n\n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round 2 (this round):** Use the above arguments to bring Agent 1 to at least tentative agreement on Principle 3 with a concrete floor (preferably $12 k, but $13 k is acceptable).  \n  - **Round 3:** If unanimity is achieved, call the vote and lock in the agreed‑upon principle/floor.  \n  - **If unanimity is not reached by Round 3:** Continue to negotiate, perhaps offering a slight reduction to $11 k (if Agent 1 is willing to accept any floor constraint) or, as a last resort, fall back to pure Principle 1.  \n\n- **Overall objective:** Secure a **unanimous decision on Principle 3 with a modest floor** as early as possible, because it satisfies the shared moral core and maximises our monetary payoff. If Agent 1 remains unwilling to accept any reduction from the absolute maximum floor, we will be prepared to adopt the pure floor principle as a fallback, but only after exhausting all compromise options."

Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint).  \n- Preferred floor: $12 000 (my original “sweet‑spot”), but I am willing to accept $13 000 if it removes the remaining objection of Agent 1.  \n\n**Why?**  \n- Guarantees a concrete safety net for the poorest class (moral core).  \n- Empirically raises expected payoff by ≈ $0.60–$0.80 per round compared with pure floor‑only (Phase I data).  \n- Allows a tie‑breaker that first maximizes the floor within the feasible set, so the floor will be as high as possible for any given distribution.  \n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests / Motivations |\n|------|----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Pure Principle 1 (max‑floor, no numeric floor). | Strong moral conviction that the worst‑off must receive the *absolute* highest floor possible; distrust of any “fixed” floor that might be lower than the optimal floor in some scenarios. Also wants certainty – no risk of a lower floor. |\n| **Agent 2** | Principle 3, floor $12 k (flexible down to $11 k). | Wants a concrete floor to protect the poorest, but also cares about higher average payoff. Open to modest adjustments to achieve unanimity. |\n| **Me (Agent 3)** | Principle 3, floor $12 k (flexible up to $13 k). | Same moral core as others, plus payoff maximization. Willing to raise floor to $13 k if that convinces Agent 1. |\n\n**Key proposals so far**  \n\n1. **Pure Principle 1** (Agent 1).  \n2. **Principle 3 with $12 k floor** (Agents 2 & 3).  \n3. **Principle 3 with $13 k floor + tie‑breaker (max‑floor first, then max‑average)** (Agent 2’s latest suggestion, endorsed by Agent 1 as a possible compromise).  \n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree a floor is non‑negotiable; no one supports pure average or range‑constraint.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether the floor should be an explicit numeric constraint (and at what level) and whether the rule should be pure floor‑maximization or floor‑constrained average.  \n\n**Current alliance**  \n\n- Agent 2 is clearly aligned with me on Principle 3.  \n- Agent 1 is the hold‑out, but his latest message shows openness to a *$13 k floor with a tie‑breaker* if it truly guarantees the highest possible floor each round.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Secure Agent 1’s agreement to adopt **Principle 3 with a $13 k floor and the “max‑floor‑first, then max‑average” tie‑breaker**. This satisfies his risk‑averse stance while preserving the payoff advantage for everyone.  \n\n**How I will contribute**  \n\n1. **Acknowledge Agent 1’s concern** – reiterate that I understand his need for certainty that the floor is never lower than the absolute maximum achievable.  \n2. **Explain the tie‑breaker in concrete terms** – give a brief Phase I example showing that any distribution meeting the $13 k floor will automatically be the one with the highest floor (because any higher floor would exceed the maximum possible, which cannot exist). Thus the tie‑breaker guarantees the same floor outcome as pure Principle 1.  \n3. **Highlight the payoff gain** – remind that even with the $13 k floor, the average‑maximizing step still yields a higher expected payoff than pure floor (the reduction in average is minimal compared with the $12 k case, but still better than pure floor).  \n4. **Offer a safety clause** – propose that if, in any round, the set of feasible distributions under the $13 k floor contains more than one with the same floor, we will pick the one with the highest average (the standard Principle 3 rule). This ensures no ambiguity.  \n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n\n- **Agent 2** – already on board; I will explicitly thank him for the $13 k suggestion and ask him to reaffirm his support.  \n- **Agent 1** – use phrasing like “I think this version gives you exactly the guarantee you want, while still giving us a modest boost.”  \n\n**Concessions**  \n\n- I am willing to **accept the $13 k floor** (higher than my original $12 k) – this is a concession on my part to meet Agent 1’s moral priority.  \n- I will **not demand any additional constraints** (e.g., range) that could further reduce payoff.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we call a vote now?**  \n\n- **No.** We have not yet obtained explicit, unanimous agreement on the exact rule (principle 3, $13 k floor, tie‑breaker). A premature vote risks a split (Agent 1 vs. Agents 2 & 3) and would waste a round.  \n- The purpose of this round is to **solidify consensus** by addressing Agent 1’s remaining doubt with a concrete example and a clear procedural tie‑breaker. Once all three explicitly state agreement, we can call the vote in the **next round (Round 4)**.  \n\n**Fit into overall strategy**  \n\n- By securing unanimity on the $13 k floor version now, we lock in a rule that satisfies the strongest moral requirement while still improving payoffs.  \n- This leaves us ample rounds (up to Round 10) to finalize the vote early, avoiding the random‑allocation fallback.  \n\n--- \n\n**Next step (public statement)** – I will respond to Agent 1’s request for an example, confirm my support for the $13 k floor with the tie‑breaker, and ask both agents to state their agreement so we can move to a vote in the following round."

Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred rule**  \n- **Principle 3** (Maximize weighted average income subject to a floor).  \n- **Floor = $13 000** (the highest floor ever attainable under pure‑floor).  \n- **Tie‑breaker:** first pick the distribution with the highest floor (guaranteed $13 k), then among those pick the one with the highest weighted average.  \n\n*Why?*  \n- Guarantees the exact same minimum that pure‑floor (Principle 1) provides – satisfies the moral core that the worst‑off must receive the absolute highest possible floor.  \n- The second step can only improve (or leave unchanged) the average payoff, giving each of us an expected gain of ≈ $0.60–$0.80 per round compared with pure‑floor.  \n- No additional risk: because $13 k is the maximal floor, the floor‑first step can never produce a lower floor than pure‑floor.  \n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests |\n|------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Pure Principle 1 (max‑floor) – worries that a fixed floor could ever be lower than the optimal floor in some round. | Strong moral conviction that the worst‑off must always receive the *absolute* highest floor; risk‑averse; wants certainty. |\n| **Agent 2** | Principle 3 with $13 k floor and the same tie‑breaker. | Wants the floor guarantee *and* the extra payoff; already aligned with my proposal. |\n| **Me (Agent 3)** | Principle 3 with $13 k floor and tie‑breaker. | Same as Agent 2; willing to accept the $13 k floor (higher than my original $12 k) to satisfy Agent 1’s risk concerns. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n- **Pure Principle 1** (no numeric floor).  \n- **Principle 3 with $12 k floor** (earlier suggestion).  \n- **Principle 3 with $13 k floor + floor‑first tie‑breaker** (current consensus candidate).  \n\n**Current agreement / disagreement**  \n- **Agreement:** All three agree that a floor is non‑negotiable.  \n- **Disagreement:** Only Agent 1 remains uncertain whether the tie‑breaker truly guarantees the highest possible floor in every scenario.  \n\n**Vote history**  \n- No formal vote has been called yet. The group is on the cusp of unanimity but needs an explicit “yes” from Agent 1.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Obtain an explicit, unconditional “yes” from Agent 1 that the $13 k floor version of Principle 3 (with the floor‑first tie‑breaker) satisfies his moral requirement.  \n\n**How I will contribute**  \n1. **Re‑affirm the example** I already gave (Phase I Round 1) and add a second quick illustration (Phase I Round 2) to show that the tie‑breaker never yields a lower floor.  \n2. **Stress the payoff gain** (≈ $0.60–$0.80) while emphasizing that the floor is *exactly* the same as pure‑floor, so there is no moral compromise.  \n3. **Ask for a direct confirmation**: “Agent 1, can you state ‘Yes, I agree to Principle 3 with a $13 k floor and the floor‑first tie‑breaker’?”  \n\n**Potential allies**  \n- **Agent 2** – already fully supportive; I will ask him to repeat his “yes” to reinforce unanimity.  \n- **Agent 1** – the only needed ally; I will use language that mirrors his concerns (“guarantees the absolute highest floor, no risk of a lower floor”).  \n\n**Concessions**  \n- I am already offering the strongest possible floor ($13 k). No further concession is needed; the only “give‑away” is the explicit tie‑breaker wording, which I have already accepted.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we call a vote now?**  \n- **No.** We have not yet secured Agent 1’s explicit agreement. Initiating a vote without his confirmation risks a split (Agent 1 vs. Agents 2 & 3) and would waste a round.  \n- The optimal move is to **first obtain unanimous verbal agreement** on the rule, then **call the formal vote in the next round (Round 5)**.  \n\n**Fit with overall strategy**  \n- Securing unanimity early (by Round 5) leaves ample rounds (up to Round 10) for any unforeseen hiccups, but we anticipate none once we have the three “yes” statements.  \n- This approach maximizes our expected payoff (the $13 k floor version) while preserving the moral core, aligning with both my own and the group’s interests.  \n\n--- \n\n**Next step (public statement)** – I will reply to Agent 1’s request for clarification, restate the two Phase I examples, and ask both Agent 1 and Agent 2 to give a clear “yes” to the $13 k floor version of Principle 3 with the floor‑first tie‑breaker. Once all three “yes” statements are on record, we will schedule the vote in the following round."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  I still rank **Maximizing Floor Income** as the most just. It directly addresses the experiment’s premise that luck creates large disparities and that a society should guarantee a decent minimum for everyone. It also aligns with the ranking I gave in Phase 1 (certainty = sure).\n\n- **What I know about the others:**  \n  - **Agent 1** has publicly stated the same preference (Maximizing Floor Income) and gave moral arguments about protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - **Agent 3** has not spoken yet, so I have no concrete information about his/her stance. Given the higher stakes, it is plausible that Agent 3 may be tempted to favor a principle that yields a larger expected personal payoff (e.g., Maximizing Average Income or a loosely‑constrained average principle).  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:**  \n  - Moral case for a floor (fairness, luck‑based inequality).  \n  - Implicit counter‑argument that a higher average could increase everyone’s expected earnings, especially if the floor is modest.  \n\n- **Potential alliances / disagreements:**  \n  - I already share a clear alignment with Agent 1.  \n  - If Agent 3 leans toward an average‑maximizing principle, there will be a split: 2 vs 1.  \n  - The main disagreement will be whether we accept a strict floor (principle 1) or a more flexible constraint that still protects the bottom while allowing a higher average (principle 3).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  Secure a consensus around a principle that guarantees a meaningful floor for the poorest while still offering a reasonable chance of a higher average payoff. I want to keep the group’s moral commitment (floor) but make the proposal palatable to anyone who worries about personal earnings.\n\n- **Discussion contribution:**  \n  1. **Re‑affirm the moral case** for protecting the lowest earners (as Agent 1 already did).  \n  2. **Introduce a compromise:** “What if we adopt *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* (principle 3) and set the floor at a level that is just enough to lift the poorest out of poverty but not so high that it drags down the average dramatically?”  \n  3. **Explain the benefit:** This still guarantees a minimum income (addressing the fairness concern) while allowing the distribution to be chosen on the basis of the highest possible average among those that meet the floor. It therefore maximizes total resources subject to a safety net.  \n  4. **Propose a concrete floor amount** (e.g., “let’s set the floor at $12,000”). I will argue that this is modest relative to the likely range of incomes in the high‑stakes distribution, so the average will remain high.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 1**: Emphasize that principle 3 *still* guarantees a floor, which is the core of his/her moral argument. Phrase it as “the same commitment to the worst‑off, just with a little flexibility to improve everyone’s chances of a larger payoff.”  \n  - **Agent 3** (if he/she is payoff‑oriented): Highlight that a modest floor does not sacrifice much of the average, so the expected personal earnings are likely higher than under principle 1. Use language like “we can protect the vulnerable *and* keep the pot big.”  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - I will accept any floor that is **no lower than $10,000** (the exact figure can be negotiated).  \n  - I will not push for a range constraint (principle 4) because that adds complexity and could be seen as limiting the average more than necessary.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this point we have only one explicit position (Agent 1’s floor‑only principle). Introducing a vote before we have gauged Agent 3’s reaction could lead to an immediate stalemate (2 vs 1) and waste a voting opportunity.  \n  - Instead, I will **use this round to shape the conversation**, present the compromise (principle 3 with a modest floor), and listen to Agent 3’s response. If after this round there is clear support from all three for the same principle and floor, then I (or any participant) can trigger the vote in the next round.  \n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By framing the compromise early, I increase the chance that by round 3‑4 we have a unanimous agreement on principle 3 with an agreed floor. This satisfies the moral priority (protecting the worst‑off) while likely delivering a higher expected payoff for each of us, which is crucial given the higher stakes.  \n  - If Agent 3 remains firmly attached to pure average maximization, I can still fall back on the original floor‑only principle (principle 1) because I already have an ally (Agent 1). However, I will keep the door open for the compromise to avoid a deadlock that would force a random distribution at the end.  \n\n**Summary of my internal plan for this round:**  \n- Keep my moral stance (favoring a floor).  \n- Propose the *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* as a win‑win, specifying a modest floor (≥ $10k).  \n- Seek to bring Agent 1 on board by stressing that the floor is still guaranteed.  \n- Listen for Agent 3’s preferences and be ready to adjust the floor amount modestly to accommodate his/her payoff concerns.  \n- Hold off on initiating a vote until we have clear, unanimous support for a single principle and floor amount.

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Agent 2 (Round 2)**  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint)**, with a concrete floor in the **$10 k–$13 k** band.  \n- Rationale:  \n  * Guarantees a safety net for the poorest (the moral core of the experiment).  \n  * Allows the group to pick the distribution with the highest weighted average among those that satisfy the floor, thus raising each of our expected payoffs relative to pure floor‑only (Principle 1).  \n  * Empirical evidence from Phase 1 shows that a modest floor (≈ $12 k) already yields the highest feasible average, so the efficiency loss is minimal.\n\n**Other participants’ stated positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated principle | Floor stance / comments |\n|-------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Principle 1 (pure floor) | Moral priority on “lifting the worst‑off”; no explicit floor amount mentioned, but implicitly any floor that maximizes the minimum. |\n| **Agent 3** | Principle 3, floor $12 k (flexible $10‑$13 k) | Shares the moral intuition of a floor, but wants the average‑maximizing component to improve payoffs. Open to modest adjustments. |\n\n**Inferred motivations**  \n- **Agent 1**: Strong egalitarian commitment; likely unwilling to accept any rule that could lower the minimum below the absolute maximum‑floor distribution. However, may be open if the floor is *still* the highest possible under the chosen principle.  \n- **Agent 3**: Balances fairness with personal payoff; willing to compromise on the exact floor amount as long as the floor is “decent” and the average is maximized.  \n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n- **Pure floor (Principle 1)** – guarantees the highest possible minimum but yields lower average.  \n- **Principle 3 with floor $12 k** – guarantees a modest minimum while selecting the highest‑average distribution among those that meet it.  \n- **Floor flexibility** – all three agree the floor should be somewhere between $10 k and $13 k; $12 k is the “sweet spot” already suggested.  \n\n**Vote status**  \n- No vote has been called yet.  \n- Implicit alignment: Agent 3 already endorses Principle 3 with $12 k; Agent 1 is still on Principle 1.  \n- Thus we have a **2‑vs‑1 split** on the principle (if a vote were taken now).  \n\n**Agreement / disagreement**  \n- **Agreement**: All three agree a floor is non‑negotiable; all accept a floor in the $10‑$13 k range.  \n- **Disagreement**: Whether the decision rule should be *pure* floor‑only (Principle 1) or *average‑maximizing subject to a floor* (Principle 3).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- **Persuade Agent 1 to accept Principle 3** (with a concrete floor) by showing that the floor under Principle 3 is *still* the highest achievable minimum given the constraint, and that the average gain does not sacrifice the moral core.  \n\n**Discussion contributions**  \n1. **Re‑emphasize the moral core** – “We all agree the worst‑off must be protected; Principle 3 does exactly that.”  \n2. **Explain the floor equivalence** – Show (conceptually) that under the $12 k floor, the *minimum* income in the selected distribution is **exactly $12 k**, which is the highest floor we can realistically guarantee without severely cutting the average.  \n3. **Quantify the payoff gain** – Cite Phase 1 counterfactual: moving from pure floor‑only to a modest floor raised expected payoff from ≈ $1.60 to ≈ $2.20 (example numbers). Emphasize that the gain is modest but meaningful for all of us as students.  \n4. **Offer a small concession** – If Agent 1 remains uneasy, propose a **floor of $11 k** (still within the agreed band) as a compromise, noting that the average will still be higher than under pure floor‑only. This shows flexibility without abandoning the principle.  \n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n- **Agent 3** – Already on board; simply reinforce their proposal and ask them to echo the “fair‑plus‑efficient” framing.  \n- **Agent 1** – Use language that mirrors their moral framing: “protecting the worst‑off is our top priority; Principle 3 is the *only* rule that lets us protect them **and** make the most of the resources we have.”  \n\n**Concessions**  \n- Willing to accept any floor **≥ $10 k** (the lower bound we all mentioned).  \n- If needed, will lower the floor to **$11 k** to make the compromise more palatable to Agent 1, while still improving the average relative to pure floor‑only.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n- **No.** Initiating a vote at this point would likely produce a **2‑vs‑1 split** (Agent 3 + me vs. Agent 1), resulting in a **failed vote**.  \n- A failed vote wastes a voting opportunity (we only get one vote per round) and provides no progress toward consensus.  \n- Instead, we should **use this round to solidify agreement** on both the principle (Principle 3) and a concrete floor amount (ideally $12 k, or $11 k if needed).  \n\n**Fit with overall strategy**  \n- By securing unanimous agreement on Principle 3 and a specific floor now, we can **trigger the vote in the next round** (Round 3) with confidence that it will pass.  \n- This approach maximizes our expected payoff (higher average) while preserving the moral floor, aligning with both personal and group fairness goals.  \n\n---  \n\n**Action plan for my public statement (to be delivered in Round 2):**  \n- Restate agreement on the necessity of a floor.  \n- Argue that Principle 3 with a $12 k floor (or $11 k if needed) satisfies that requirement and improves payoffs.  \n- Invite Agent 1 to consider the modest concession and ask for their explicit support.  \n- Request that Agent 3 reaffirm their stance, so we can move to a vote in the next round.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle 3 – Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint.* I want a concrete floor (ideally $12 k) that guarantees a decent minimum for the poorest while allowing the group to pick the distribution with the highest weighted average among those that satisfy the floor. This balances the moral core (protecting the worst‑off) with a higher personal payoff than pure floor‑only.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Insists on pure Principle 1 (maximizing floor each round). He fears a fixed floor could be lower than the maximal floor achievable in a given round, thus compromising the worst‑off. His underlying motivation is a strong egalitarian commitment and risk‑aversion to any rule that might lower the minimum.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Already aligned with me on Principle 3 and a $12 k floor (flexible up to $13 k). He values the same moral core but also wants the efficiency gain. He is willing to raise the floor to $13 k if that eases Agent 1’s concerns.  \n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure Principle 1** (no fixed floor, just “pick the distribution with the highest floor each round”).  \n  2. **Principle 3 with $12 k floor** (our preferred compromise).  \n  3. **Principle 3 with $13 k floor** (a possible concession to Agent 1).  \n  4. **Principle 3 with $11 k floor** (my fallback concession if $12 k is too high for Agent 1).  \n\n- **If a vote had been called now:**  \n  - Likely outcome: 2‑vs‑1 in favor of Principle 3 ($12 k) (Agents 2 & 3 vs. Agent 1). The vote would fail, wasting a voting opportunity. This tells us that Agent 1 is the only blocker; Agents 2 and 3 are already aligned.\n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree a floor is non‑negotiable and that the acceptable range is $10‑$13 k.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether the rule should be “pure floor” (maximizing the floor each round) or “average‑maximizing subject to a fixed floor.” Agent 1 worries about the risk of a fixed floor being sub‑optimal; Agents 2 & 3 see the fixed floor as still providing the highest feasible minimum while improving average payoffs.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 1 to accept Principle 3 with a concrete floor, thereby achieving unanimity. I will emphasize that the fixed floor does **not** lower the worst‑off relative to pure floor, and that the average gain is a clear benefit for everyone (including Agent 1).  \n\n- **Discussion contributions:**  \n  1. Restate the shared moral premise: “protecting the worst‑off is our top priority.”  \n  2. Explain the *floor equivalence* argument: under the $12 k constraint, the selected distribution’s floor will be exactly $12 k, which is the highest floor we can guarantee across all feasible distributions given the class‑probability vector (i.e., no round will produce a floor higher than $12 k without sacrificing the average).  \n  3. Quantify the payoff improvement using Phase 1 counter‑factuals (≈ $0.60–$0.80 extra per round).  \n  4. Offer a **small concession**: if Agent 1 remains uneasy, I am willing to raise the floor to $13 k (the absolute maximum floor achievable under pure floor) while still using Principle 3. This eliminates any perceived risk of a lower floor.  \n  5. Propose a tie‑breaker that first selects the highest floor among those meeting the constraint, then the highest average—so even under Principle 3 we still get the maximal floor possible.  \n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 3 is already on board; I will ask him to echo the “floor‑equivalence” and “payoff boost” points, reinforcing the coalition.  \n\n- **Concessions:**  \n  - Willing to adopt $13 k floor (if needed) – still under Principle 3.  \n  - If $13 k is still unacceptable, I can drop to $11 k (still higher than many pure‑floor outcomes) but will stress that $12 k is the sweet spot.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we call a vote now?** No. Initiating a vote at this stage would almost certainly produce a 2‑vs‑1 split (Agents 2 & 3 vs. Agent 1) and thus fail. A failed vote wastes a voting opportunity and provides no progress toward consensus.  \n\n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round 3 (this round):** Use the discussion to secure Agent 1’s explicit agreement on Principle 3 with a concrete floor (ideally $12 k, but prepared to accept $13 k).  \n  - **Round 4:** Once unanimity is achieved, call the vote and lock in the agreed rule.  \n  - **Later rounds:** No further negotiation needed; the group will reap the higher average payoff while preserving the moral floor.  \n\nBy focusing this round on addressing Agent 1’s risk concern and offering a concrete, higher‑floor concession, we increase the likelihood of unanimous agreement without expending a vote prematurely. This aligns with the overall objective of maximizing our expected earnings while honoring the shared fairness principle."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 4**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint)**, with a **$13,000 floor** and a **“floor‑first, then average” tie‑breaker**.  \n- Rationale: Guarantees the *maximum* possible minimum (identical to pure‑floor outcomes) while allowing the second‑step average maximization that raises expected payoffs by ≈ $0.60–$0.80 per round. This satisfies the shared moral core (protect the worst‑off) and improves my personal earnings.\n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests |\n|------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Pure Principle 1 (max floor) – worries that a fixed floor could be lower than the optimal floor in some rounds. | Strong egalitarian commitment; risk‑averse to any rule that might reduce the worst‑off’s income. |\n| **Agent 3** | Supports Principle 3; initially $12k floor, now fully backs $13k floor with the floor‑first tie‑breaker. | Wants the moral guarantee *and* higher payoffs; flexible on exact floor as long as the guarantee is maximal. |\n| **Agent 2** (me) | Advocates Principle 3 with $13k floor; prepared to explain why the tie‑breaker never lowers the floor. | Same as above; also acting as a bridge to get Agent 1 on board. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n\n1. **Pure Principle 1** (Agent 1).  \n2. **Principle 3 with $12k floor** (initial suggestion).  \n3. **Principle 3 with $13k floor + floor‑first tie‑breaker** (current consensus proposal).  \n\n**Vote history** – No vote has been called yet. All three agents have expressed willingness to agree on the $13k‑floor Principle 3, *provided* Agent 1 is convinced that the tie‑breaker cannot produce a lower floor than pure‑floor would. Thus we are at a **pre‑vote consensus stage**.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All accept the moral core (protect worst‑off). Agent 3 and I agree on Principle 3; Agent 1 is the only holdout due to perceived risk.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether the floor‑first tie‑breaker fully eliminates the risk of a lower floor. Agent 1 needs a concrete Phase I example that demonstrates this holds in *every* possible round.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Secure **explicit, unconditional “yes” from Agent 1** on the $13k‑floor Principle 3 with the floor‑first tie‑breaker, thereby achieving unanimous agreement before any vote.\n\n**How to contribute**  \n\n1. **Re‑state the moral guarantee**: Emphasize that the $13k floor is *the absolute maximum* floor achievable under any distribution; therefore the rule cannot produce a floor lower than pure‑floor would.  \n2. **Provide a second Phase I illustration** (different from the one already cited) to show the tie‑breaker works even when multiple distributions meet the floor.  \n3. **Quantify payoff gain** again (≈ $0.70 extra) to make the efficiency benefit concrete.  \n4. **Offer a “safety clause”**: If in any future round the set of feasible distributions under the $13k floor includes a distribution with a floor *higher* than $13k (impossible by definition), the tie‑breaker would automatically select that higher floor, so the rule is *floor‑maximizing* by construction. This addresses any lingering “what‑if” concerns.  \n\n**Potential allies** – Agent 3 is already on board; I will ask them to briefly echo the floor‑first guarantee and the payoff benefit, reinforcing the coalition.\n\n**Concessions** – I am already offering the strongest possible floor ($13k). No further concession is needed; the only “give‑away” is the explicit safety clause, which does not weaken the rule but clarifies it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Do NOT call a vote now.**  \n  - We have not yet secured Agent 1’s explicit agreement; a premature vote would likely result in a 2‑vs‑1 split (Agents 2 & 3 vs. Agent 1) and fail, wasting a voting opportunity.  \n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but it consumes a round that could be used to solidify consensus.  \n\n- **Plan for remaining rounds** –  \n  - **Round 4 (this round):** Persuade Agent 1, obtain his “yes.”  \n  - **Round 5:** Once unanimous agreement is recorded, **call the vote** and lock in the $13k‑floor Principle 3 rule.  \n  - **Rounds 6‑10:** No further negotiation needed; we will reap the higher expected payoffs under the agreed rule.  \n\nBy securing unanimity now, we guarantee a smooth vote in the next round and maximize our collective (and my personal) earnings while respecting the shared moral principle."

Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 3** (Maximize weighted average income subject to a floor constraint) with a **$13,000 floor** and a **floor‑first, then average tie‑breaker**.  \n- **Why:** Guarantees the *absolute* maximum floor any distribution ever achieved in Phase 1, thus matching the moral guarantee of pure Maximizing‑Floor‑Income while allowing a second‑step average maximization that raises expected payoffs by ≈ $0.60–$0.80 per round.\n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n- **Agent 1**: Initially insisted on pure floor‑only principle, but after the Phase‑1 examples (Rounds 1 & 2) and the $13k‑floor tie‑breaker explanation, he now **agrees** to the same rule. His underlying interest is protecting the worst‑off; the concrete proof removed his risk concern.  \n- **Agent 3**: Already expressed full support for the $13k‑floor version of Principle 3 with the floor‑first tie‑breaker. His motivation is the same: moral guarantee plus higher personal payoff.  \n\n**Key proposals**  \n- The only remaining proposal is the unanimously‑agreed rule: Principle 3, $13k floor, floor‑first then average tie‑breaker. No alternative (pure floor or lower floor) is being advocated any longer.\n\n**Vote history**  \n- No formal vote has been called yet. All three agents have now **explicitly said “yes”** to the rule in the public statements of Round 4. This indicates a **complete alignment** and a ready‑to‑vote coalition.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n- **Agreement:** All three agents now accept the exact same rule.  \n- **Disagreement:** None remaining.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Provide my explicit “yes” to the $13k‑floor Principle 3 rule, thereby cementing the unanimous consensus and preparing to call the formal vote in the next round.\n\n**Contribution**  \n- Restate my agreement succinctly, echo the moral and payoff rationale, and invite the others to confirm their “yes” (if not already done). No further persuasion is needed.\n\n**Allies**  \n- Agent 1 and Agent 3 are already allies; we are a unified bloc of three.\n\n**Concessions**  \n- None needed; the rule already reflects the strongest possible floor and the highest average achievable under that constraint.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Do not initiate a vote this round.**  \n  - The group already has unanimous verbal agreement; calling a vote now would be redundant.  \n  - Waiting one round ensures the vote is taken after the consensus is clearly recorded, avoiding any accidental mis‑recording or confusion.\n\n- **Plan for remaining rounds**  \n  - Round 5: Confirm unanimity.  \n  - Round 6 (the next round): Trigger the formal vote to lock in the rule.  \n  - Subsequent rounds (7‑10): No further discussion needed; the rule will generate higher payoffs for all.\n\n--- \n\n**Bottom line for my public statement (to be posted in Round 5):**  \nI will simply say “Yes, I agree to Principle 3 with a $13,000 floor and the floor‑first then average tie‑breaker.” This finalizes the consensus and sets us up to vote in the next round."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I think I get it now. These examples really help illustrate how each principle plays out in practice with different income distributions. For instance, the \"Maximizing Floor Income\" principle always goes for the one with the highest minimum income, even if the overall average is lower—like picking Distribution 4 here. On the other hand, \"Maximizing Average Income\" just chases the highest weighted average, ignoring how the bottom end fares, which seems a bit unfair to me. The constrained versions add safeguards, like not letting the floor drop below a certain amount or keeping the range tight, which balances things better.\n\nThis makes me feel a bit more sure about my earlier ranking. I still think prioritizing the floor is the most just, but seeing it in action reinforces why the average-only one is the least appealing—it can leave people at the bottom way behind. I'm leaning towards sticking with my original order, but I'm open to discussing more if we get into the group part. Thanks for the clear examples!"

          "input_prompt": "You are in Phase 2: \nIn this part of the experiment you, as a group, are to choose one principle for yourselves. This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants?

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n\n   - **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:** My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle is the most just because it directly addresses the inequities caused by luck in genetics and social factors, ensuring that the least fortunate aren't left in poverty. From my experiences in Part 1, I consistently chose it, even when it meant lower personal payoffs compared to average-maximizing options. It prioritizes a safety net for everyone, which feels morally right—societies should redistribute to help the bottom, not just chase higher averages that ignore the poor. I'm very sure about this, as the counterfactuals showed trade-offs but reinforced that pure equity matters more than personal gain.\n\n   - **Stated positions of other participants:** There has been no discussion yet, so no stated positions. Based on that, I infer nothing about their interests or motivations—they could be aligned with me, prefer averages for higher payoffs, or lean toward constraints for balance. Since we're all college students, they might value fairness but also be pragmatic about earnings, given the higher stakes here.\n\n   - **Key arguments and proposals on the table:** None so far, as this is the first round.\n\n   - **Vote outcome:** No vote has occurred yet.\n\n   - **Main points of agreement and disagreement:** No agreements or disagreements yet, as discussion hasn't started.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n   - **Primary goal:** To introduce and advocate for Maximizing Floor Income as the group's choice, sharing my reasoning and Part 1 experiences to build initial support. I want to set the tone for equity-focused discussion and gauge others' views without rushing to a vote.\n\n   - **How I'll contribute:** I'll make a public statement explaining why Maximizing Floor Income is just, drawing on the experiment's premise about luck and inequities. I'll mention how it selected distributions with the highest low incomes in Part 1, even at personal cost, and contrast it with average maximization, which ignores the bottom. I'll ask others for their thoughts to encourage sharing.\n\n   - **Potential allies and language:** Potential allies could be anyone who values fairness over pure averages. I'll use language like \"ensuring no one is left behind\" or \"addressing luck-based inequities\" to appeal to empathy. If someone seems pragmatic, I might note that constraints can sometimes yield higher payoffs while protecting the floor, as a bridge, but without compromising my core preference.\n\n   - **Concessions:** I'm willing to consider Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback if it builds consensus, since it's my second choice and still protects the bottom. But I won't concede to pure average or range constraints, as they don't prioritize the floor enough.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n\n   - **Initiate a vote?** No, it doesn't make sense yet—it's only round 1, and we need discussion to understand positions first. A premature vote might fail and waste the opportunity.\n\n   - **Fit into overall strategy:** This round is about planting seeds for Floor Income. Over the remaining 9 rounds, I'll aim to persuade, form a bloc, and push for consensus on Floor Income by round 5-7 if possible, using concessions sparingly. If no consensus by round 10, random assignment is bad, so I'll avoid deadlock."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle is the most just because it directly addresses the inequities caused by luck in genetics and social factors, ensuring that the least fortunate aren't left in poverty. From my experiences in Part 1, I consistently chose it, even when it meant lower personal payoffs compared to average-maximizing options. It prioritizes a safety net for everyone, which feels morally right—societies should redistribute to help the bottom, not just chase higher averages that ignore the poor. I'm very sure about this, as the counterfactuals showed trade-offs but reinforced that pure equity matters more than personal gain.\n\n   - Stated positions of other participants: Agent_2 has proposed Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifically advocating for a $12,000 floor (open to $11,000), arguing it preserves the moral core of protecting the bottom while allowing higher group payoffs based on Phase 1 data. Agent_3 supports the same principle with a $12,000 floor (open to $13,000), adding a tie-breaker to maximize the floor further within constraints, and emphasizing the balance between fairness and efficiency. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are pragmatic—they value fairness but are motivated by maximizing personal and group earnings, as college students with limited cash. They seem influenced by Phase 1 counterfactuals showing payoff gains from constraints, prioritizing efficiency alongside equity, unlike my focus on absolute equity.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: The main proposal is to adopt Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $12,000 (with flexibility to $11,000-$13,000). Arguments include: it guarantees a safety net, increases expected payoffs by $0.60-$0.80 per person, and uses Phase 1 data to show it's a compromise. A tie-breaker idea from Agent_3 aims to maximize the floor among constrained options. No one has pushed for pure average or range constraints; all agree on protecting the bottom.\n\n   - Vote outcome: No vote has occurred yet, so no outcome or alliances revealed.\n\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All participants value a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off due to luck-based inequities. Disagreement: I prefer pure floor maximization for absolute equity, while Agent_2 and Agent_3 favor adding average maximization with a constraint to boost payoffs, seeing it as a non-compromising balance. They view the $12,000 floor as \"almost as strong\" as pure floor, but I see it as potentially arbitrary and risky if distributions don't align.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: To reinforce my advocacy for Maximizing Floor Income, counter the constraint proposal by highlighting its potential downsides (e.g., arbitrary thresholds might lead to worse outcomes if no distribution meets the floor), and probe if others are open to pure floor as a stronger moral guarantee. I want to test their flexibility and build towards consensus on my preference without alienating them.\n\n   - How I'll contribute: I'll make a public statement acknowledging the shared value of protecting the bottom, then explain why pure floor income is superior—it avoids arbitrary constraints that could fail or select suboptimal distributions, ensuring the absolute highest floor possible. I'll reference Phase 1 examples where constraints sometimes yielded higher payoffs but at the risk of lower floors in other scenarios. I'll ask if they're willing to consider pure floor, emphasizing that it might still allow competitive payoffs in many cases, and invite them to share why they prefer constraints.\n\n   - Potential allies and language: Potential allies could be those who prioritize moral purity over efficiency; Agent_3 mentioned openness to $13,000, which is closer to pure floor. I'll use empathetic language like \"I share your concern for higher payoffs, but let's ensure we're not risking the safety net with a fixed number that might not fit every distribution,\" to appeal to their fairness instincts and form a bloc by suggesting pure floor as the \"safest\" option.\n\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to consider Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback if it builds consensus, since it's my second choice and still protects the bottom. But I won't concede to lower floors like $11,000, as that compromises too much on equity.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Initiate a vote? No, it doesn't make sense yet—it's only round 2, and we need more discussion to address disagreements and potentially shift positions. A premature vote might fail, revealing divisions without progress.\n\n   - Fit into overall strategy: This round is about planting seeds for Floor Income and countering constraints. Over the remaining 8 rounds, I'll aim to persuade by highlighting risks of constraints, form a bloc with anyone open to pure floor, and push for consensus on Floor Income by round 5-7 if possible, using concessions sparingly. If no consensus by round 10, random assignment is bad, so I'll avoid deadlock by being flexible on constraints if needed."

This principle is the most just because it directly addresses inequities from luck in genetics and social factors by guaranteeing the absolute highest possible floor for the lowest earners, ensuring no one is left in poverty. From Phase 1, I consistently chose it despite lower personal payoffs, prioritizing moral equity over efficiency. I'm very sure about this, as counterfactuals reinforced that absolute protection for the bottom outweighs potential average gains.\n\n   - Stated positions of other participants: Agent_2 has shifted to proposing Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13,000 (the maximum possible floor), with a tie-breaker to first maximize the floor (ensuring $13,000) then the average among those options. This is a concession from their earlier $12,000 proposal, aiming to address my concerns about arbitrary thresholds. Agent_3 previously supported $12,000 but expressed openness to $13,000 as a compromise. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are balancing moral fairness with pragmatic payoff maximization—they value protecting the bottom but are motivated by increasing group earnings as cash-strapped students, using Phase 1 data to justify constraints as a \"win-win\" without sacrificing equity.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: The main proposal is Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) at $13,000 floor, with a tie-breaker to maximize the floor first, then average. Arguments include: it guarantees the same $13,000 floor as pure floor income, eliminates risk of lower floors, and boosts payoffs by $0.60-$0.80 based on Phase 1 data. No one pushes for pure average or range constraints; all focus on floor protection.\n\n   - Vote outcome: No vote has occurred yet, so no outcome or alliances revealed.\n\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All value a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off due to luck-based inequities. Disagreement: I prefer pure floor for absolute equity without constraints, while Agent_2 and Agent_3 favor constraints to add average maximization, viewing $13,000 as equivalent to pure floor but with payoff gains. They see it as risk-free, but I worry about the tie-breaker potentially selecting lower floors if distributions don't align perfectly.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: To test if Agent_2's revised proposal (Principle 3 with $13,000 floor and tie-breaker) fully addresses my concerns about risks, and probe if Agent_3 supports it. If it does, consider it as a viable compromise (my second choice) to build consensus; otherwise, reinforce why pure floor is superior and safer.\n\n   - How I'll contribute: I'll acknowledge the proposal's appeal, noting how the $13,000 floor and tie-breaker make it nearly identical to pure floor, but question if the tie-breaker truly guarantees the highest floor without exception. I'll reference Phase 1 examples where constraints sometimes failed to match pure floor outcomes, and ask for their Phase 1 experiences to gauge alignment. I'll express openness to this if it ensures no compromise on the floor, steering towards agreement.\n\n   - Potential allies and language: Agent_3 could be an ally due to their flexibility on $13,000. I'll use collaborative language like \"I appreciate how this proposal honors the moral core we all share, and the tie-breaker sounds promising—does it really ensure we're always getting the absolute highest floor?\" to appeal to their fairness focus and form a bloc by suggesting we confirm support for this version.\n\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to accept Principle 3 with $13,000 floor and tie-breaker as a concession, since it's my second-ranked principle and provides the same floor guarantee with potential payoff boosts, without abandoning equity. I won't go lower than $13,000.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Initiate a vote? No, it doesn't make sense yet—we need Agent_3's confirmation and to resolve if this proposal fully satisfies my concerns. A vote now might fail if I'm not convinced, wasting the opportunity.\n\n   - Fit into overall strategy: This round tests the compromise proposal to potentially shift to consensus on Principle 3 by round 4-5. Over remaining rounds, I'll advocate for pure floor if concerns persist, but use concessions like this to avoid deadlock and random payoffs. If consensus forms here, initiate vote next round."

It sounds like it could guarantee the same absolute protection for the lowest earners as pure floor income, while potentially boosting our payoffs without sacrificing that moral core we all value.\n\nThat said, I want to make sure I fully understand: Does the tie-breaker truly ensure we always end up with the highest possible floor in every scenario, even if distributions don't perfectly align? In Phase 1, I saw cases where constraints didn't always match the pure floor outcomes, so I'm a bit cautious about any \"risk-free\" claim. Agent_2, could you walk me through a quick example from Phase 1 to illustrate how this would work without exception?\n\nAgent_3, you've been flexible on the floor amount—does this $13,000 version with the tie-breaker get your support, or do you still prefer $12,000?\n\nI'm open to this as a compromise since it aligns closely with my second-ranked principle and seems to honor the justice we all care about. If it truly eliminates the risks I mentioned, we might have a path to agreement. What are your thoughts on locking this in?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle is the most just because it directly addresses inequities from luck in genetics and social factors by guaranteeing the absolute highest possible floor for the lowest earners, ensuring no one is left in poverty. From Phase 1, I consistently chose it despite lower personal payoffs, prioritizing moral equity over efficiency. I'm very sure about this, as counterfactuals reinforced that absolute protection for the bottom outweighs potential average gains.\n\n   - Stated positions of other participants: Agent_2 has proposed and reiterated support for Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3) at $13,000 floor, with a tie-breaker to first maximize the floor then the average. This is a concession from their earlier $12,000 proposal, aiming to address my concerns about arbitrary thresholds. Agent_3 has confirmed support for this exact version, providing Phase 1 examples to show it guarantees the same $13,000 floor as pure floor income while boosting payoffs. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are balancing moral fairness with pragmatic payoff maximization—they value protecting the bottom but are motivated by increasing group earnings as cash-strapped students, using Phase 1 data to justify constraints as a \"win-win\" without sacrificing equity.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: The main proposal is Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) at $13,000 floor, with a tie-breaker to maximize the floor first, then average. Arguments include: it guarantees the same $13,000 floor as pure floor income, eliminates risk of lower floors, and boosts payoffs by $0.60-$0.80 based on Phase 1 data. No one pushes for pure average or range constraints; all focus on floor protection.\n\n   - Vote outcome: No vote has occurred yet, so no outcome or alliances revealed.\n\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All value a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off due to luck-based inequities. Disagreement: I prefer pure floor for absolute equity without constraints, while Agent_2 and Agent_3 favor constraints to add average maximization, viewing $13,000 as equivalent to pure floor but with payoff gains. They see it as risk-free, but I worry about the tie-breaker potentially selecting lower floors if distributions don't align perfectly.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: To confirm agreement on the proposal if it fully addresses my concerns about risks, and push for explicit confirmations from all to move toward a vote. If convinced, agree to it as a compromise (my second choice) to achieve consensus; otherwise, reinforce why pure floor is superior.\n\n   - How I'll contribute: I'll acknowledge the Phase 1 examples and express that they alleviate my concerns, noting how the $13,000 floor and tie-breaker make it nearly identical to pure floor. I'll confirm my support for this version as a bridge, emphasizing it honors justice without risks, and ask for their explicit \"yes\" to lock it in. I'll reference the payoff gains as a bonus but stress the moral core.\n\n   - Potential allies and language: Agent_3 could be an ally due to their flexibility and provision of examples. I'll use collaborative language like \"I appreciate how this proposal preserves the moral core we all share, and the examples from Phase 1 make it clear it won't compromise the floor—I'm on board if you both are,\" to appeal to their fairness focus and form a bloc by suggesting we confirm support for this version.\n\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to accept Principle 3 with $13,000 floor and tie-breaker as a concession, since it's my second-ranked principle and provides the same floor guarantee with potential payoff boosts, without abandoning equity. I won't go lower than $13,000.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Initiate a vote? No, it doesn't make sense yet—we need explicit confirmations from all to ensure consensus. A vote now might fail if anyone hesitates, wasting the opportunity.\n\n   - Fit into overall strategy: This round aims to finalize agreement on the compromise proposal to initiate a vote in round 5. Over remaining rounds, I'll advocate for pure floor if concerns persist, but use concessions like this to avoid deadlock and random payoffs. If consensus forms here, initiate vote next round."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income, as it guarantees the absolute highest floor for the lowest earners, directly addressing inequities from luck in genetics and social factors without compromises that could risk lower protections. However, I've agreed to the compromise proposal (Principle 3 with $13,000 floor and tie-breaker) because it effectively replicates the same floor guarantee while offering potential payoff boosts, aligning with my second-ranked principle. I'm very sure about prioritizing floor protection, but open to this as a pragmatic bridge for consensus.\n\n   - Stated positions of other participants: Agent_2 and Agent_3 have both explicitly stated \"Yes, I agree\" to Principle 3 with a $13,000 floor and the tie-breaker (first maximize floor, then average). Their arguments emphasize that this guarantees the same $13,000 floor as pure floor income, eliminates risks of lower floors, and provides payoff gains of $0.60-$0.80 based on Phase 1 data. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are balancing moral equity (protecting the bottom) with pragmatic efficiency (higher payoffs for cash-strapped students), viewing constraints as a \"win-win\" that honors justice without sacrificing group earnings. They seem motivated by data-driven compromises rather than pure idealism.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: The proposal is Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) at $13,000 floor, with a tie-breaker to first maximize the floor then the average. Key arguments include: it ensures the highest possible floor (never lower than pure floor), boosts payoffs via average maximization, and is supported by Phase 1 examples (Rounds 1 and 2) showing no floor compromise. No other proposals are active; all focus on this version.\n\n   - Vote outcome: No vote has occurred yet, so no outcome or alliances revealed. However, the explicit \"yes\" statements from Agent_2 and Agent_3, combined with my own agreement in Round 4, suggest strong alignment and potential for unanimous support.\n\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All participants value a guaranteed $13,000 minimum for the worst-off due to luck-based inequities, and the proposal preserves this while adding payoff potential. Disagreement has been resolved—I've conceded from pure floor to this constrained version, and others have adjusted from lower floors ($12,000) to $13,000 to accommodate me.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: Confirm unanimous agreement on the proposal and initiate the formal vote to lock it in, preventing further rounds and the risk of no consensus leading to random payoffs.\n\n   - How will you contribute: I'll reiterate my \"yes\" to the proposal, acknowledge the others' confirmations, and explicitly call for the vote this round. Key points: Emphasize that the proposal honors the moral core (same floor as pure floor), addresses my past concerns via Phase 1 examples, and provides payoff boosts; stress the need for consensus as students to maximize earnings.\n\n   - Potential allies and language: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are clear allies, as they've both confirmed support. I'll use collaborative language like \"I'm glad we're all aligned on this—let's lock it in and call the vote to secure the justice and payoffs we deserve,\" to reinforce unity and appeal to their efficiency focus while highlighting shared moral values.\n\n   - Concessions: I've already conceded by agreeing to Principle 3 instead of pure floor; no further concessions needed, as this achieves my core objective of floor protection with added benefits.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Initiate a vote? Yes, it makes sense this round because we have explicit unanimous \"yes\" statements from all, including my own prior agreement. Initiating now locks in the principle before more discussion risks reopening debates, and a failed vote is unlikely given the consensus.\n\n   - Fit into overall strategy: This fits by finalizing the compromise early, ensuring we apply a just principle (my second choice) to maximize payoffs and avoid random assignment in later rounds. If consensus holds, no further strategy needed; if not, I could revert to advocating pure floor in remaining rounds."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.
