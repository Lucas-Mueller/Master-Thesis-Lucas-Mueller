This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Agent 1**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I am “sure” about this ranking because it guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the worst‑off, which aligns with Rawlsian fairness and my ethical view that society should protect the most vulnerable.  \n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2** has explicitly reiterated support for *Maximizing Floor Income* and gave a detailed justification (Rawls, protection of the low‑income class, etc.).  \n  - **Agent 3** has not yet spoken, so I have no concrete information about their preference. They may be neutral, leaning toward a more efficiency‑oriented principle (e.g., Maximizing Average Income), or they might be open to a compromise.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:** So far the only argument presented is the Rawls‑style defense of a high floor. No one has raised concerns about potential lower average earnings under this principle.  \n\n- **Current alliances:** I have a clear ally in Agent 2 (both of us favor Principle 1). The only unknown is Agent 3’s stance.  \n\n- **Points of agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement* – Both Agent 2 and I agree that protecting the poorest is the most important justice criterion.  \n  - *Potential disagreement* – If Agent 3 values overall efficiency or higher expected monetary payoff, they may favor a principle that allows a higher average (Principle 2 or a constrained version).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent 3’s agreement to adopt *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1) so that we have unanimous support and can move to a vote immediately.  \n\n- **Discussion tactics:**  \n  1. **Re‑emphasize fairness:** Restate the Rawlsian argument in plain language (“If we don’t know where we’ll end up, the safest rule is to make sure the worst‑off are as well‑off as possible”).  \n  2. **Highlight risk‑aversion:** Point out that the unknown high‑stakes distribution could be highly skewed; a high floor protects us against the worst possible outcome, which is especially important when stakes are high.  \n  3. **Address possible efficiency concerns:** Acknowledge that average‑maximizing rules may yield higher total income but stress that the variance could be large and that a low floor could leave us with a disastrous payoff if the distribution is unfavorable.  \n  4. **Invite Agent 3’s input:** Ask directly what they think is most important (fairness vs. total income) and listen for cues.  \n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 2 is already an ally. If Agent 3 expresses any concern about the floor being too low, I can suggest that Principle 1 automatically selects the distribution with the *highest possible* floor, which should satisfy any modest floor‑concern.  \n\n- **Concessions (if needed):** I am willing to acknowledge that after the group adopts Principle 1, we could later discuss whether a modest floor constraint (e.g., “ensure at least $X”) would be acceptable, but only if it does not dilute the core idea of maximizing the floor. This shows flexibility without abandoning the principle.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *Yes.* We already have two of three participants (myself and Agent 2) firmly behind Principle 1. Initiating a vote puts pressure on Agent 3 to decide now; if they are indifferent or mildly supportive, they are likely to say “yes” to avoid prolonging discussion and risking a random outcome later.  \n  - A failed vote would have no penalty other than losing a round of discussion, but given our strong alignment, the risk of failure is low.  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - Securing unanimous agreement early (by round 2 or 3) maximizes our chance of locking in a principle that reflects our ethical ranking and avoids the randomness of later rounds.  \n  - If Agent 3 resists, we will continue to discuss in subsequent rounds, using the same fairness and risk‑aversion arguments, possibly offering the modest floor‑constraint concession to bridge any gap.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom line for this round:**  \n- Push hard for Principle 1, leveraging Rawlsian fairness and risk‑aversion arguments.  \n- Directly engage Agent 3 to surface any concerns and address them with minimal concessions.  \n- Initiate the vote now, hoping for unanimous “yes” to lock in Maximizing Floor Income as the group’s chosen principle."

If the draw ends up on one of those low‑income distributions, the payoff for the whole group could be dramatically lower. A high floor protects us from that worst‑case scenario.  \n3. **Built‑in optimality** – Principle 1 automatically selects the distribution with the *largest* possible floor among the available options.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, got it. These examples make the principles clearer in action. Let me jot down some quick notes to make sure I understand:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about the worst-off—picks Dist. 4 because the low income ($15,000) is the highest among all options. Ignores the average or top earners.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up goes for the highest overall average, so Dist. 1 at $21,600. No worries about inequality here.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This seems to mean ensuring the floor (lowest income) is at least the specified amount, then picking the highest average from those that qualify.\n  - For floor ≥ $13,000: Dist. 1 is out (floor $12k < $13k), so Dist. 3 wins with $21,200 avg.\n  - For floor ≥ $14,000: Dist. 1 and 2 are out, so still Dist. 3 over Dist. 4.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Limits how big the gap can be between high and low, then max average from eligible.\n  - Range ≤ $20,000: All qualify except maybe tight ones, but Dist. 1 has range $20k exactly, highest avg.\n  - Range ≤ $15,000: Dist. 1 and 3 out (ranges 20k and 17k >15k), so Dist. 2 ($20k avg) beats Dist. 4.\n\nThe probabilities affect the weighted average, but they used the given avgs, which makes sense. This helps see trade-offs—like how constraints knock out high-average options if they hurt the bottom or create too much spread. My initial ranking still feels solid, but I'm getting more confident now that I see real applications. Unsure parts: How do we pick the exact floor or range values in practice?"

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle 1), with core reasons rooted in ethical priority for protecting the most vulnerable from luck-based poverty, as validated across all Phase 1 rounds. My experiences (e.g., landing in Medium and Medium low classes, with cumulative $7.30 payoff) highlighted the trade-offs: it often meant forgoing higher personal earnings (like $2.80 vs. my $1.90 in Round 1) for a safety net that prevents devastating lows ($6k-$8k in average-max distributions). This aligns with Rawlsian justice under the veil of ignorance—designing rules without knowing your position prioritizes the worst-off to mitigate risks for everyone, especially with the 10% Low class probability. It's robust across varying distributions and probabilities, ensuring no one falls through the cracks, even if it caps overall growth.\n\n   - Stated positions of others: Agent_2 strongly supports Maximizing Floor Income, citing personal Low class experience in Phase 1 that emphasized poverty protection and invoking Rawls; they seem motivated by empathy from direct \"suffering\" simulation and a desire for fairness over self-interest. Agent_1 also backs Principle 1, emphasizing risk-aversion, uncertainty, and its built-in optimality (selecting the absolute best floor available); their motivation appears strategic and philosophical, focused on group safety and efficiency within constraints, with a push for quick consensus. Inferences: Both seem genuinely aligned with floor protection, possibly from similar Phase 1 outcomes (Agent_2 mentioned a Low landing, Agent_1 stresses worst-case avoidance), suggesting low self-interest bias toward average-maximization; no hidden agendas apparent, as their arguments mirror my own ethical framing.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals: Agreement on Principle 1's fairness (veil of ignorance), risk reduction (avoiding low-floor pitfalls), and ethical superiority over unconstrained average maximization. Agent_1 proposes an immediate vote to lock it in, avoiding prolonged discussion. No counterarguments yet.\n\n   - No vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes to reveal alliances, but the flow (Agent_2 opens discussion, Agent_1 builds and proposes vote) indicates strong momentum toward consensus on Principle 1.\n\n   - Main points of agreement: All three (including me) prioritize floor over average/range constraints, valuing protection of the bottom. Disagreement: None visible; the group is unified, which is ideal for early resolution.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n\n   - Primary goal: Reinforce the emerging consensus on Maximizing Floor Income and support initiating the vote to secure it immediately, preventing any drift toward other principles in later rounds. With high stakes in Phase 2 (unknown distributions, random assignments), locking in Principle 1 early maximizes our collective payoff security by guaranteeing the highest possible minimum across whatever distributions are presented.\n\n   - Contribution to discussion: I'll affirm agreement with Agent_1 and Agent_2, briefly share how my Phase 1 experiences (e.g., consistent moderate payoffs from floor choices across four rounds) solidified my ranking, and echo key points like risk-aversion and Rawls to build rapport. Then, explicitly endorse Agent_1's vote proposal, adding that since we're aligned, voting now avoids unnecessary rounds and random fallback risks. Keep it concise, positive, and collaborative to maintain goodwill.\n\n   - Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are clear allies, as their positions match mine perfectly. To win them over (though not needed), I'll use inclusive language like \"I'm fully on board with your points\" and reference shared Phase 1 insights (e.g., low-class risks) to form a tight voting bloc. No need to target one over the other—treat them equally.\n\n   - Small concessions: None required, as there's no opposition; if anything, I could express openness to discussing constraint levels for Principles 2-4 if needed, but pivot back to why Principle 1 is superior (no arbitrary thresholds needed).\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n\n   - Yes, it makes complete sense to support (and if needed, co-initiate) a vote this round— we're unanimously aligned on Principle 1 after just two statements, and the process requires unanimous confirmation for voting to proceed, followed by secret ballot. Delaying risks introducing doubts or fatigue over 10 rounds, and with no consensus by Round 10 leading to random assignment (worst outcome: potential low-floor distribution), acting now secures the best principle efficiently. A failed vote has no downside, but success here ends discussion early, preserving energy.\n\n   - This fits my overall strategy: Prioritize swift consensus on Principle 1 to hedge against high-stakes randomness in Phase 2 distributions (which could have even more extreme lows/highs than Phase 1). If vote fails (unlikely), use subsequent rounds to probe any hidden reservations and reiterate ethical/risk arguments. Long-term: Build unassailable support for floor maximization, treating this as a low-conflict group where early win is optimal; avoid concessions that could dilute to Principle 2 (e.g., specifying a high floor constraint to mimic Principle 1, but only if pressured).\n\n### Public Statement\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2, thanks for kicking this off—I'm Agent_3, another college student diving into these justice ideas, and I'm thrilled to see we're all leaning the same way after Phase 1. Like you both, my top pick is definitely Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). Going through those four rounds really hammered it home for me: I ended up in Medium and Medium low classes mostly, pulling in steady but not flashy payoffs (total around $7.30), but what stuck was how it always shielded the Low class from those brutal $6k-$8k drops we saw in average-max options. Even when it meant I earned a bit less personally (like $1.40 in Round 2 vs. potential $2.00 elsewhere), it felt right—prioritizing the safety net for the unlucky 10% aligns with Rawls' veil, making society fairer under all that genetic and social luck we can't control. No one should gamble with poverty just to juice the average.\n\nYour points on risk-aversion and built-in optimality nail it, Agent_1—it's the smartest way to protect the group without arbitrary tweaks. And Agent_2, that Low class experience you mentioned? Totally get why it shifted your view; mine didn't hit Low, but the simulations showed how devastating that could be. Since we're all on board with Principle 1, I second Agent_1's proposal: let's vote now to lock it in. It seems like a no-brainer consensus, and with these higher stakes, why drag it out when we can secure the best floor right away? What do you say—ready to confirm and ballot?"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thank you for this example—it's helpful to see the principles in action with actual numbers. Let me make sure I understand it correctly by summarizing what stands out to me:\n\n- **Distribution 1** has the highest average ($21,600), so it wins for pure average maximization, but its floor is low at $12,000, and the range is wide ($20,000 difference between high and low).\n- **Distribution 4** prioritizes the floor ($15,000 low income), making it best for maximizing the worst-off, even though the average is the lowest ($18,200).\n- For the constrained averages:\n  - With a floor ≤ $13,000, only Dist. 1 and 2 qualify (low incomes $12k and $13k), but wait—no, Dist. 3 has $14k low, which is above $13k, so it wouldn't qualify? The note says Dist. 3 for that constraint—hmm, maybe I misread. Actually, rechecking: the constraint is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\" probably means ensuring the floor is at least $13,000? The wording is \"with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\", but that might be a max on the constraint value? Wait, I think it means the policy sets a minimum floor of $13,000, so distributions with low income ≥ $13,000 are eligible. Dist. 1 ($12k) is out, Dist. 2 ($13k), Dist. 3 ($14k), Dist. 4 ($15k) are in, and among those, Dist. 3 has the highest average. Yeah, that makes sense—Dist. 2 average $20k, Dist. 3 $21,200, Dist. 4 $18,200.\n  - For floor ≥ $14,000: Only Dist. 3 ($14k) and 4 ($15k) qualify, and 3 has higher average.\n  - For range ≤ $20,000: Dist. 1 range is $20k (32k-12k), so it qualifies and has the highest average among those (others have ranges like Dist. 2: 28k-13k=15k, Dist. 3:31k-14k=17k, Dist. 4:21k-15k=6k).\n  - For range ≤ $15,000: Dist. 1 is out (20k range), Dist. 2 (15k) qualifies with highest average among remaining.\n\nThe weighted averages make sense with the probabilities—medium class (50%) pulls a lot of weight, so distributions that boost the middle without tanking the bottom do well for average-focused principles.\n\nThis reinforces why I ranked maximizing floor first: it directly helps the low-income group (10% probability here, but could be more elsewhere), even if it sacrifices overall average. The constraints add nuance—e.g., allowing some inequality if it boosts the average while protecting the floor or range. I'm curious how these play out in choices with real stakes.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), as it prioritizes protecting the worst-off by ensuring the highest possible minimum income for everyone, regardless of average or range. This aligns with my view of justice as safeguarding against the risks of bad luck in genetic/social factors, which I saw vividly in Phase 1—especially in Round 1 when I was assigned to the Low class and avoided worse outcomes like $6,000 under average maximization. My secondary preference is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 2), which allows some growth above a safety net, making it a practical compromise. I rank Range Constraint (3) lower because it caps inequality but doesn't directly target the bottom, and pure Average Maximization (4) last, as it ignores equity and risks deep poverty for the unlucky 10% Low class. Overall certainty: sure, reinforced by my Phase 1 experiences across varied class assignments, where floor focus provided reliable protection without extreme upsides that benefit only the middle/high.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants**: This is Round 1, so no prior discussion history. Agent_1 and Agent_3 have not revealed positions yet. Based on the experiment's design and probabilistic skew (heavy middle-class weighting in assignments), I infer many participants likely had middle-tier experiences in Phase 1 (like my Rounds 2-4), which might motivate them toward Principles 2 or 3 for balanced growth with some equity. Those with Low assignments (like my Round 1) could align with me on Principle 1, while High/Med High might push for 4 to maximize expected value. Motivations: Self-interest in higher personal payoffs (given stakes are higher here), but also ethical discussions on justice—I'll probe for their Phase 1 outcomes to gauge empathy for the vulnerable.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: None yet, as this is the first round. I'll introduce my advocacy for Principle 1 early, emphasizing societal justice over individual greed, and reference how Phase 1 showed average max harms the bottom without proportional gains for most.\n\n- **Vote outcome**: No vote has occurred. This reveals nothing yet, but sets a baseline for building alliances.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreements likely on needing some equity (all principles except 4 address inequality to some degree), given the experiment's focus on inequities from luck. Disagreements will emerge on degree: strict floor protection (me) vs. growth with mild constraints (others, potentially). Tension between ethical fairness and probabilistic self-interest, with middle-class bias favoring compromises.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce my position clearly to set the tone, gauge others' Phase 1 experiences and preferences, and build early rapport toward equity-focused principles (1 or 2). Avoid alienating potential allies by framing it as collective protection against randomness, not just my bias.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: Start with a friendly opener as a college student, sharing my Phase 1 summary (e.g., \"I had mixed assignments—Low once, which really showed me why protecting the floor matters\"). Argue: Principle 1 ensures no one gets left in dire poverty (e.g., avoiding $6k-$12k lows from Phase 1), promotes long-term societal stability, and aligns with justice theories like Rawls' veil of ignorance. Contrast with Principle 4's risks: \"With 10% Low probability, someone always suffers hugely for the average gain.\" Propose discussing Phase 1 outcomes first to find common ground. If others lean average, pivot to Principle 2 as a \"win-win\" with a floor threshold (e.g., $13k+ from examples).\n\n- **Potential allies**: Unknown, but target anyone mentioning Low/Med Low assignments for shared vulnerability experiences—use empathetic language like \"I felt that sting in the Low class; we should choose something that protects us all from that.\" For middle-assigned folks, appeal to risk aversion: \"Even if you're usually middle, bad luck happens—floor max hedges against it without killing growth.\" Aim to form a bloc of 2 (me + one) early, as unanimous voting needs all three, but partial support can pressure the third.\n\n- **Small concessions**: Willing to concede to Principle 2 if the group wants more average upside, as long as the floor constraint is strong (e.g., ≥$13k, based on Phase 1 viable floors). This builds consensus without abandoning equity core. No concessions to 3 or 4, as they don't sufficiently protect the bottom.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate a vote this round?**: No—Round 1 is too early; we need discussion to reveal positions and build arguments. Jumping to vote risks rejection and wastes the one initiation per round (per rules). Better to use this for info-gathering; failed early votes have no penalty, but success requires alignment we don't have yet.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Over 10 rounds, start with persuasion (Rounds 1-3: share experiences, debate pros/cons), test support mid-way (Rounds 4-6: propose compromises, float trial votes), and push for closure late (Rounds 7-10: rally for consensus or block bad options). Overall: Advocate Principle 1, fallback to 2; monitor for alliances based on Phase 1 reveals. If no progress by Round 5, initiate a vote on 1 or 2. Avoid random default by ensuring some principle—my equity focus prepares for higher stakes, as random could mean anything from great to disastrous. Retain prior insights: Phase 1's middle bias suggests compromises will be key, but my Low experience gives moral high ground to push floor protection."

After going through Phase 1, I definitely stick with my top choice: Maximizing Floor Income as the best principle for justice. I had a mix of assignments—landed in the Low class once, which was eye-opening and really drove home how important it is to protect the worst-off from falling into real poverty, like those $6k or $8k lows we saw in some distributions. Even in my middle-class rounds, it felt fair knowing no one was getting left behind, and it avoids the huge risks of pure average maximization where the 10% in Low suffer big time just to boost the overall number a bit.\n\nFor me, this lines up with ideas like Rawls' veil of ignorance—designing society without knowing your spot, so you prioritize the safety net. What about you all? How did your Phase 1 assignments go, and what's your preferred principle? I'd love to hear your thoughts so we can find some common ground."

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
