The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

This aligns with the equity‑focused stance I have consistently taken in Phase I and with my “sure” certainty about the ranking.\n\n- **What I know (or can infer) about the other participants:**\n  - **Agent 2:** No statements have been made yet, but given the typical diversity of viewpoints in these experiments, it is plausible that Agent 2 may be attracted to a principle that balances equity and efficiency, such as *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* (principle 3) or *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint* (principle 4). They might argue that a modest floor or a limited spread can protect the worst‑off while still allowing higher overall wealth.\n  - **Agent 3:** Similarly, Agent 3 could be more efficiency‑oriented and favor *Maximizing Average Income* (principle 2), especially since the stakes in Phase II are “much higher.” They may claim that maximizing total resources creates more opportunities for everyone, including the poor, through trickle‑down effects.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table (so far):** None have been voiced publicly yet. The only “argument” is the implicit one that each of us has a pre‑existing ranking from Phase I. I anticipate that the discussion will revolve around:\n  1. **Equity vs. efficiency trade‑off** – how much weight to give to the lowest‑income class versus total wealth.\n  2. **Risk considerations** – with higher stakes, the variance of outcomes may matter; a principle that raises the floor reduces downside risk for the poorest.\n  3. **Feasibility of constraints** – for principles 3 and 4, we will need to agree on a concrete floor amount or range limit, which could become a negotiation point.\n\n- **Potential alliances / disagreements:**  \n  - I expect **potential alignment** with any participant who also values a guaranteed minimum (e.g., Agent 2 if they lean toward principle 3).  \n  - **Potential conflict** with a pure efficiency advocate (Agent 3) who may view the floor‑only principle as too restrictive and costly in terms of total payoff.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure agreement on *Maximizing Floor Income* (principle 1) as the group’s chosen principle. Because this principle requires no additional constraint specification, it is the simplest to adopt and eliminates the need for a second‑stage negotiation, which could otherwise fracture consensus.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. **Emphasize risk‑aversion:** Highlight that with “much higher” stakes, guaranteeing a decent minimum payoff protects the group from the worst possible outcome.  \n  2. **Moral framing:** Argue that a just society should first ensure that no one falls below a basic standard of living; this resonates with fairness norms and the experimental framing about “luck” and “genetic/social accidents.”  \n  3. **Practical simplicity:** Point out that principle 1 avoids the extra step of agreeing on a floor amount or range, reducing procedural complexity and the chance of deadlock.\n\n- **Potential allies & language to win them over:**  \n  - **Agent 2 (if equity‑concerned):** “I know you care about protecting the most vulnerable. By choosing the pure floor principle we guarantee the highest possible minimum for everyone, which is exactly what you want, without having to negotiate a specific floor level that might end up lower than optimal.”  \n  - **Agent 3 (if efficiency‑concerned):** “Even if we aim for the highest average, the variance in outcomes could be huge. By securing the floor first, we ensure that the group’s worst‑case payoff is decent, and any extra efficiency we could gain later would be a bonus. In other words, we can’t improve the average without first protecting the minimum.”\n\n- **Small concessions (if needed):** I am willing to acknowledge that the average payoff under principle 1 may be lower than under principle 2 or 3, but I will stress that the experiment’s purpose is to explore justice, not just maximize money. I could also suggest that after the group adopts principle 1, we could discuss informal “bonus” ideas (e.g., voluntary sharing) that do not alter the formal principle but may improve perceived fairness.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **Yes.** Initiating a vote early (Round 1) gives us the chance to lock in a consensus while the discussion is fresh and before any fatigue or strategic maneuvering sets in. Because the voting mechanism requires unanimous confirmation, I will first seek verbal (or written) agreement from the others that we are ready to vote on principle 1. If any participant expresses hesitation, I will pause the vote and continue the discussion to address concerns.\n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but an early successful vote secures the high‑stakes payoff under the principle I favor and prevents the group from drifting toward a more efficiency‑biased choice later.\n\n- **How does this fit into the overall 10‑round plan?**  \n  - **Round 1:** Aim for consensus on principle 1. If successful, the remaining nine rounds become moot (the group can still discuss, but the principle is already fixed).  \n  - **If consensus is not reached:** Use the remaining rounds to build incremental support—first by highlighting the floor’s moral and risk‑reduction benefits, then by possibly offering a modest “floor‑constraint” compromise (principle 3 with a floor just slightly above the current minimum) as a fallback. However, my ultimate objective remains to keep the floor as high as possible, which is best achieved by principle 1.\n\n**Summary of internal plan:**  \n- Advocate strongly for *Maximizing Floor Income* (principle 1) on moral, risk‑management, and procedural grounds.  \n- Seek early unanimous agreement and trigger the vote in this round.  \n- Be prepared to address any equity‑concerned or efficiency‑concerned objections with targeted arguments and minimal concessions that do not dilute the core principle."

A just society should first guarantee that the worst‑off group gets the highest possible minimum income, regardless of how much total wealth we can generate. Protecting the floor directly addresses those accidents.\n\n2. **Risk reduction** – In Phase II the stakes are much higher. By locking in the highest possible floor we protect ourselves from the worst‑case payoff. Even if the average under other principles could be a bit higher, the variance—and the chance of ending up with a very low payoff for the poorest class—remains larger. A higher floor gives us a solid safety net.\n\n3. **Simplicity** – The pure‑floor principle needs no extra negotiation about a specific floor level or a range constraint. That means we can reach agreement quickly and avoid dead‑lock over the exact numbers, which can be contentious and time‑consuming.\n\n**What this means for the group**\n\n- Everyone gets the same guaranteed minimum payoff that the experiment shows is the highest possible under this rule.\n- Any additional gains from raising the average would have to come at the expense of lowering that minimum, which I don’t think aligns with the justice goal we’re asked to consider.\n\n**Proposed next step**\n\nIf you’re on board, let’s move straight to a unanimous vote on adopting **Maximizing Floor Income** as our group principle.

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income. This is based on my consistent ranking and choices throughout Part 1, where I prioritized protecting the worst-off due to the role of luck in income disparities. From the examples and my personal payoffs, I saw that while this principle sometimes resulted in lower individual earnings for me (e.g., in rounds where maximizing average could have given me more), it ensured the lowest income class got the highest possible minimum, which feels morally right and aligns with addressing inequities. The higher stakes in Phase 2 make this even more appealing, as it provides a safety net against extreme lows, though I'm aware it might cap overall averages.\n\nThe stated positions so far: Agent_1 has strongly advocated for Maximizing Floor Income, framing it as the most just, safest, and simplest option. They emphasize moral priority for the worst-off, risk reduction in high-stakes payoffs, and avoiding contentious negotiations over constraints. Agent_3 has not spoken yet, so their position is unknown.\n\nBased on Agent_1's arguments, I infer their motivations are primarily risk-averse and focused on fairness—wanting to minimize downside risks for everyone, especially in a group setting where random assignment could hurt anyone. They seem pragmatic, pushing for quick consensus to avoid deadlock. No underlying self-interest is evident; it feels genuine.\n\nKey arguments and proposals: Agent_1's proposal is to adopt Maximizing Floor Income unanimously and move to a vote. Their points on moral grounds, risk, and simplicity are solid and align with my views. No counterarguments or alternative proposals have been raised yet.\n\nNo vote has been conducted, so no outcomes to analyze. Main points of agreement: Likely with Agent_1 on the value of the floor principle. Disagreements: Unknown, but if Agent_3 prefers something like maximizing average (which I ranked lowest), there could be tension over equity vs. efficiency.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to express strong support for Maximizing Floor Income, build on Agent_1's points, and encourage Agent_3 to join the consensus. This could help solidify an early alliance and steer the discussion toward agreement, reducing the risk of dragging into later rounds where random assignment looms.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by agreeing with Agent_1, then share a brief personal reflection from Part 1 to add credibility—mentioning how sticking to the floor principle felt right despite occasional lower payoffs, emphasizing the trade-offs for justice. This could persuade Agent_3 by showing real experience. I'll propose we hear from Agent_3 before voting, to gauge their views without rushing.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is clearly an ally. For Agent_3, I'll use inclusive language like \"we all experienced the trade-offs in Part 1\" to appeal to shared group interests, framing it as a collective choice for fairness. If Agent_3 leans toward constraints, I could note that floor constraints are a close second in my ranking, but I'll push for pure floor first.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm not willing to concede my core preference yet. If needed, I could acknowledge that constraints might be acceptable if pure floor doesn't fly, but only as a fallback—my strategy is to hold firm on pure floor to avoid diluting the equity focus.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round. We should let Agent_3 speak first to understand their position and avoid a premature or failed vote that could polarize the group. A failed vote has no penalties, but it might signal divisions early, making consensus harder later.\n\nThis round's plan fits my overall strategy: Aim for quick consensus on Maximizing Floor Income in the first few rounds to secure the safety net. If disagreement emerges, pivot to negotiating floor constraints as a compromise, while blocking unconstrained average maximization. Monitor for shifts based on others' inputs, and be prepared to reiterate personal stakes if payoffs feel threatened. If no progress by round 5-7, consider initiating votes on alternatives to force decisions."

From my experience in Part 1, I stuck with it through all the rounds because it prioritizes protecting the worst-off, which aligns with addressing those luck-based inequities we talked about. Even when it meant sometimes getting a bit less personally (like in rounds where maximizing average could have bumped up my payoff), it just felt right to ensure the lowest class got the highest possible minimum. The safety net aspect is huge, especially with the higher stakes now.\n\nThat said, let's hear from Agent_3 before jumping to a vote. What are your thoughts on this, Agent_3?

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I've gone through these examples carefully. It's helpful to see the principles in action with actual numbers and probabilities. Let me just jot down my quick takeaways to make sure I get it:\n\n- The weighted average uses those class probabilities, which makes sense since not everyone is equally likely to end up in each income class. For instance, the medium class (50% probability) has a big impact on the overall average.\n\n- Maximizing Floor Income picks Dist. 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000), even though the overall average is the lowest. That really emphasizes protecting the worst-off, no matter the trade-offs.\n\n- Straight Maximizing Average Income goes for Dist. 1 with the highest weighted average (~$20,750), ignoring the bigger gaps.\n\n- For the floor constraints (I assume it's distributions where the low income is at least the specified amount, like >= $13,000), it filters out options below that and picks the best average from what's left. So for >= $13k, Dist. 3 wins; same for >= $14k.\n\n- Range constraints limit the high-low gap (e.g., <= $20,000 range keeps Dist. 1 eligible and best; tighter at <= $15,000 knocks out Dist. 1 and 3, so Dist. 2 takes it).\n\nThis clarifies how we'd apply these in choices—balancing priorities like equity vs. efficiency.

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning (Not Shared)\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income**, as it's my top-ranked from Part 1. Core reasons: It directly safeguards the worst-off against luck-based inequities (genetics, social factors), which the experiment highlights as key to justice. From my rounds, it provided consistent protection without the trade-offs of averages that could sacrifice the low end—e.g., in high medium-low probability rounds like Round 4 (36%), it ensured solid outcomes for probable classes while avoiding downside risks. I'm very confident in this, as my experiences showed pure floor edging out constrained options for uncompromising equity, even if it sometimes meant slightly lower personal payoffs (e.g., $2.00 in Round 4 vs. potential $2.40 unconstrained).\n   - Stated positions of others: Agent_1 is strongly advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, framing it around moral priority (addressing accidents of birth), risk reduction (safety net for worst-case), and simplicity (no need for negotiations on constraints). Agent_2 fully agrees, referencing their Part 1 choices sticking to it for protecting the worst-off and the safety net, and they're deferring to me before voting. Inferences: Both seem genuinely motivated by equity and risk-aversion, not self-interest—Agent_1's proposal for a quick unanimous vote suggests they want efficiency and alignment. No hidden agendas apparent; they both prioritize floor over efficiency, matching my views. Agent_2's personal round experiences sound similar to mine, building potential rapport.\n   - Key arguments on the table: Focus on floor's moral/risk/simplicity benefits; proposal to vote unanimously on it now. No counterarguments yet.\n   - No vote has occurred, so no outcomes to analyze, but it reveals strong early alignment—two out of three already supportive.\n   - Main points of agreement: All emphasize protecting the worst-off and addressing inequities; disagreement: None visible, which is ideal for quick consensus.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n   - Primary goal: Reinforce the group's momentum toward Maximizing Floor Income by affirming agreement, briefly tying in my Part 1 insights to add credibility, and initiating a vote to lock it in early. This secures my top principle without dragging out discussion, minimizing risk of someone shifting to a lower-ranked option like unconstrained average.\n   - Contribution: I'll start casually (as a college student), echo their moral/risk points, share a quick Part 1 anecdote to show shared experience, then propose confirming the vote. Keep it positive and collaborative to maintain goodwill.\n   - Potential allies: Both Agent_1 and 2—they're already on board, so I'll use language like \"I'm totally with you\" to solidify the bloc. No need to win anyone over; just affirm to prevent any second-guessing.\n   - Small concessions: None necessary, as my core objective aligns perfectly. If needed later, I could float a mild floor-constraint as a fallback, but not here.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n   - Yes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round— we're clearly aligned after just two statements, and with 10 rounds total, locking in early avoids fatigue or persuasion toward less equitable principles (e.g., if someone pushes average maximization later). Unanimous confirmation should be easy, and a failed vote has no downside. For the secret ballot, I'll select principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) with no constraints needed.\n   - Overall strategy fit: This round builds immediate consensus for my preferred principle, freeing later rounds (if needed) for reflection or minor tweaks. If we succeed, Part 2 ends fast with high-floor payoffs; if not, I can pivot to advocating my #2 (floor constraint) in subsequent rounds. Prioritizing equity means pushing for floor now, as random assignment at the end (if no consensus by round 10) could be disastrous with higher stakes.\n\n(Previous internal reasoning not applicable yet, as this is Round 1; no need to carry over.)\n\n### Public Statement (Round 1 / Speaker: Agent_3)\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nI'm totally on board with you both—Maximizing Floor Income is hands down my top pick too, and it's awesome to see us aligning right out of the gate. As a college student who's seen how unequal starting points (like family luck or just random opportunities) can mess with people's lives, I love how this principle puts the moral focus on lifting the worst-off as high as possible. In Part 1, I stuck with floor-focused choices through all four rounds because it felt like the real safety net against those downside risks— like in the rounds with heavy medium-low probabilities, it kept things steady without gambling on big averages that could leave the low end hanging. The simplicity is a big plus too; no haggling over exact constraints means we can decide fast and fair.\n\nSince we're all saying the same thing, how about we go ahead and confirm a vote on adopting Maximizing Floor Income right now? I'm ready to select it as principle 1 in the ballot. What do you say—yes from everyone?\n\nLooking forward to wrapping this up strong!"

Situational Analysis:\n   - From Round 1, strong alignment: Agent_1 proposed Maximizing Floor Income with solid moral, risk, and simplicity arguments; Agent_2 fully agreed, emphasizing protection of the worst-off from their Part 1 experiences and deferred to me; I affirmed agreement, shared my equity focus and Part 1 insights (e.g., steady outcomes in high medium-low probability rounds), and proposed an immediate unanimous vote. No disagreements surfaced—everyone's on the same page for floor as the top principle, matching my final ranking (#1). This suggests genuine consensus driven by shared views on justice as prioritizing the vulnerable over efficiency.\n   - No vote outcome specified yet (assuming the discussion proceeds round-by-round before balloting), so Round 2 is an opportunity to reinforce and push for confirmation. Inferences: Agents 1 and 2 seem committed; Agent_2's deference indicates they're open to my lead. No signs of shifting toward my lower-ranked principles (e.g., average with floor constraint), which is ideal—early lock-in prevents dilution.\n   - Key arguments recap: Moral equity against luck, risk aversion for worst-case, simplicity for quick decision. My Part 1 tie-in (consistent protection across probabilities) adds personal credibility without revealing specifics that could invite debate.\n   - Agreement level: Near-unanimous; main risk is over-discussion leading to second thoughts, but with 10 rounds, brevity favors us.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - Goal: Build on Round 1 momentum by recapping agreement, addressing any implicit hesitation (e.g., Agent_2's \"let's hear from Agent_3\" was already responded to), and explicitly calling for the vote again. As a college student, keep tone enthusiastic and relatable to foster unity. If we confirm now, we can end Part 2 early with floor-based payoffs, aligning with my equity priority and avoiding random assignment risks.\n   - Contribution: Short and positive—echo key points, reference group synergy, propose vote execution. Avoid introducing alternatives to prevent opening Pandora's box.\n   - Allies: Leverage the bloc; phrase as \"we're all in\" to include everyone. No concessions needed; if pushback emerges later, fallback to my #2 principle.\n   - Broader fit: Secures top principle for high floor guarantees, informed by Part 1 where floor choices yielded reliable $2.00+ payoffs in probable classes, better than volatile averages.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - In the secret ballot (if triggered this round), stick with principle 1: Maximizing Floor Income (no constraints). With alignment, expect unanimous yes—success means group adoption and equitable payoffs; failure just continues discussion, no loss. Push early to capitalize on consensus before fatigue sets in over 10 rounds.\n\n### Public Statement (Round 2 / Speaker: Agent_3)\n\nHey team,\n\nJust circling back from Round 1—loving how we're all synced up on Maximizing Floor Income. Agent_1, your points on the moral side of tackling luck-based inequities and building that safety net really hit home, and Agent_2, totally get why you stuck with it in Part 1 for the same reasons; it matches my experience exactly, where focusing on the floor kept things fair and steady no matter the probabilities. No need to overcomplicate with averages or constraints when this principle nails the justice core: lift the lowest as high as possible, simply and directly.\n\nSince we're unanimous so far, let's make it official—I'm all in for voting yes on principle 1 right away. If everyone's good, we can wrap this discussion quick and move to the payoffs. Thoughts, or ready to ballot?\n\nExcited to see us decide strong!"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
