The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue?

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I rank it first because it directly guarantees the highest possible income for the poorest class, which aligns with the moral premise that luck determines life‑outcome disparities and society should protect the worst‑off. I am **sure** about this ranking.\n\n- **What I know about the others:**  \n  - **Agent 3** (from the discussion history) is explicitly advocating for the same floor‑only principle. Their argument stresses moral priority of the poorest and mentions a possible “modest floor‑constraint” as a compromise only if it never lowers the floor below what the pure‑floor rule guarantees.  \n  - **Agent 1** has not spoken yet, so I have no concrete information. Given the typical tension between fairness and personal payoff, I anticipate that at least one participant may be attracted to the higher expected monetary payoff of the *pure average* principle (Principle 4) or the *average‑with‑floor‑constraint* (Principle 3) if the constraint is loose enough to raise the average.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - Moral justification for protecting the poorest (Agent 3).  \n  - Potential willingness to accept a floor‑constraint that does not weaken the floor guarantee.  \n  - Implicit concern from some participants (likely) about maximizing personal earnings, which the average‑focused principles deliver.\n\n- **Current voting status:** No vote has been initiated yet. Therefore no explicit alliances are revealed, but the fact that Agent 3 has already articulated a clear stance suggests they will vote for Principle 1 (or a floor‑constraint with the same floor).  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement** on the importance of a floor for the low class (both Agent 3 and I).  \n  - Potential **disagreement** on whether we should also try to raise the overall average (participants favoring Principle 3 or 4).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure group consensus on *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). If that proves impossible, aim for a *floor‑constraint* that sets the floor at exactly the level guaranteed by Principle 1 (i.e., the highest achievable floor). This satisfies the moral priority while offering a modest concession that may appeal to those seeking higher average earnings.\n\n- **Discussion contributions:**  \n  1. Restate the moral case: luck creates inequality; the most just response is to guarantee the best possible outcome for the worst‑off.  \n  2. Highlight that Principle 1 already provides a “solid” monetary payoff (as shown in Phase I) and that the higher‑stakes Phase II will likely amplify all payoffs, so the floor‑only rule will not leave us dramatically worse off.  \n  3. Offer a concrete fallback: “If anyone worries about the average, we could adopt a floor‑constraint with the floor set at the maximum we can achieve (the same floor that Principle 1 guarantees). That way the floor is protected and we may still get a higher average.”  \n  4. Emphasize that any stricter constraint (e.g., a lower floor or tighter range) would reduce the feasible set and lower the average, which is contrary to both fairness and personal interest.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** – already aligned on the floor priority.  \n  - Any participant who is risk‑averse or who values fairness over maximal earnings. I will address them directly: “Choosing the floor principle protects us from the worst possible outcome for any group member, which is a safe bet in a high‑stakes setting.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accepting a *floor‑constraint* **only** if the floor is set at the highest level achievable under Principle 1 (i.e., “floor ≥ X” where X equals the maximal low‑class income from the Phase I data).  \n  - I will not accept any range‑constraint or pure average principle because they allow the floor to be lower than the maximal floor, which contradicts my core moral stance.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - Yes. Initiating a vote early (Round 1) forces the group to crystallize a decision while the discussion is fresh and before alternative proposals (e.g., pure average) gain momentum.  \n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but given the strong alignment with Agent 3 and the clear moral framing, I expect a high chance of unanimity on Principle 1 or the “max‑floor‑constraint” fallback.  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - If the vote succeeds on Principle 1, we lock in the most preferred, morally justified rule and can focus subsequent rounds on implementation details (if any).  \n  - If the vote fails because someone insists on a higher average, the fallback floor‑constraint proposal provides a bridge that still respects my top priority while giving a modest incentive to the average‑oriented participants. This keeps the group moving toward a consensus rather than splintering, preserving the chance of a unanimous decision in later rounds.  \n\n**Summary of my internal plan:**  \n- Advocate strongly for the *Maximizing Floor Income* principle, citing moral and payoff arguments.  \n- Offer a limited concession to a floor‑constraint with the maximal floor as a safety net for those uneasy about pure floor‑only.  \n- Initiate the vote now, aiming for unanimous approval of Principle 1 (or the constrained version).  \n- Leverage the already‑expressed support from Agent 3 and target any risk‑averse or fairness‑oriented participants with the safety‑first narrative."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income**.  \n  - *Why:* It guarantees the highest possible income for the Low class, directly honoring the “luck” framing that the worst‑off must be protected. I am certain (certainty = sure) that this is the most morally correct rule. The modest payoff loss relative to average‑maximizing rules is acceptable, especially since Phase II payouts will be larger overall.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Mirrors my stance. Strongly advocates Principle 1, willing to consider a floor‑constraint only if the floor is **≥ the maximum Low‑class income** observed under the pure‑floor rule (≈ $14 k). Motivation: moral commitment to the poorest; also aware of slight payoff differences.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Pushes for **Principle 2 (Average with Floor Constraint)** with a proposed floor of **$12 k**. Argues this balances protection of the worst‑off with higher average earnings. Motivation: wants a higher personal payoff while still offering a floor, but is comfortable lowering the floor below the pure‑floor guarantee.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Adopt Principle 1** (pure floor).  \n  2. **If needed, adopt Principle 3 (Floor‑Constraint)** with floor **≥ $14 k** (the maximal floor from Phase I).  \n  3. **Agent 1’s alternative:** Principle 2 with floor **$12 k**.\n\n- **Vote outcome (Round 1):**  \n  - Agent 2 (me) initiated a vote for Principle 1.  \n  - Agent 1 **declined** (voted No).  \n  - Agent 3 **declined** (voted No).  \n  - Result: **Vote failed** (no unanimous “Yes”).  \n  - *Interpretation:* Even though Agent 3 verbally supports Principle 1, they declined the formal vote—likely because the vote format required a simple Yes/No without an explicit fallback option, and they may have wanted to keep the discussion open for the conditional floor‑constraint. Agent 1’s “No” reflects preference for a lower floor. Thus, current alliances: Agent 3 aligns morally but is not committing to a strict Yes now; Agent 1 leans toward a modest floor.\n\n- **Agreement:** All agree the worst‑off should be protected.  \n- **Disagreement:** Level of floor protection (high floor vs. $12 k) and willingness to accept a compromise that may lower the floor.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a **consensus** on a rule that **preserves the maximal floor (≥ $14 k)** while still being acceptable to Agent 1. I will try to persuade Agent 1 that a floor of $14 k (or higher) does **not** dilute the moral aim and still yields a respectable average, thereby meeting both fairness and payoff concerns.\n\n- **Discussion contributions / key points:**  \n  1. **Re‑emphasize the moral baseline:** “Our experiment tells us luck creates the inequality; the strongest moral response is to guarantee the highest possible floor.”  \n  2. **Quantify the payoff impact:** Explain that moving the floor from $12 k to $14 k reduces the average only marginally (based on Phase I data the difference in personal payoff was about $0.20). In Phase II the absolute amounts are larger, so the relative loss remains small.  \n  3. **Present a concrete, simple proposal:** “Let’s adopt **Principle 3** with the floor set at **$14 k** (the maximum floor we can achieve). This satisfies the moral priority and still allows the group to pick the distribution with the highest average among those that meet this floor.”  \n  4. **Address Agent 1’s concerns:** Highlight that a $14 k floor is **higher**, not lower, than the $12 k they suggested, thus providing *more* protection for the worst‑off while still leaving room for a higher average than the pure‑floor rule (since the average‑maximizing distribution among those meeting $14 k may be better than the pure‑floor distribution).  \n  5. **Invite a quick vote** on this precise formulation (Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k). Emphasize that this is a **single‑step** decision, avoiding further rounds of indecision.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Already agrees on the moral priority and the conditional floor‑constraint; will likely support a $14 k floor.  \n  - **Agent 1:** May be persuaded if I stress that the proposed floor is *higher* than what they suggested and that the payoff loss is minimal. I will frame it as “the best of both worlds” – stronger protection plus still decent average.\n\n- **Concessions:**  \n  - I am willing to **accept the floor‑constraint** (Principle 3) rather than insisting on pure Principle 1, provided the floor is **≥ $14 k**.  \n  - I will not accept any floor lower than $14 k, nor any range‑constraint or pure average rule.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - The group has already expressed positions; a clear, concrete proposal (Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k) can be voted on immediately.  \n  - A failed vote now would not penalize us and would give us information about remaining resistance (likely only from Agent 1 if they still prefer $12 k).  \n  - Initiating the vote now also prevents endless back‑and‑forth and moves us toward a decision before the deadline.\n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - **Round 2** is the first opportunity after the initial vote failure to reshape the proposal into a compromise that still respects my core principle.  \n  - If the vote succeeds, we lock in a rule that aligns with my moral priority and likely yields a satisfactory payoff for all.  \n  - If the vote fails (e.g., Agent 1 still objects), we will have clear data that the floor level is the sticking point; subsequent rounds can focus on negotiating that specific number (perhaps offering a slight upward adjustment from $12 k toward $14 k) while keeping the floor‑constraint framework.\n\n**Summary of internal plan for Round 2:**  \n- Restate the moral case for the highest floor.  \n- Propose **Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k** as a concrete, single‑step compromise.  \n- Emphasize minimal payoff loss and higher protection than Agent 1’s $12 k suggestion.  \n- Seek the support of Agent 3 and persuade Agent 1.  \n- Initiate a vote on this exact proposal."

Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:**  \n  - **Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** is my top moral choice because it guarantees the highest possible income for the Low class, directly honoring the “luck” framing of the experiment.  \n  - I am willing to accept **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** **only if the floor is ≥ $14 k**, i.e., not lower than the best floor ever achieved under Principle 1. This preserves the moral guarantee while allowing a modest increase in average payoff.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Mirrors my stance. Strongly supports protecting the worst‑off and backs a $14 k (or higher) floor under Principle 3. Will vote “Yes” on that exact proposal.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Prefers a “middle‑ground” – what they call “Principle 2 with a $12 k floor.” In reality they are advocating a floor‑constraint with a lower floor (they are comfortable raising it to $13 k or $14 k if needed). Their underlying motivation is to improve average payoff while still offering some protection for the Low class.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure floor (Principle 1).**  \n  2. **Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k** (my current concrete proposal).  \n  3. **Principle 2 with floor $12 k** (Agent 1’s suggestion), with openness to $13 k or $14 k.\n\n- **Vote outcome so far (Round 2):**  \n  - Agent 2 (me) initiated a vote for Proposal 2.  \n  - Agent 3 confirmed “Yes.”  \n  - Agent 1 declined (“No”).  \n  - Result: no consensus (2 Yes / 1 No). The failure shows that Agent 1 is the decisive blocker; the other two are aligned on a $14 k floor.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree that the worst‑off must be protected.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Level of the floor. Agent 1 wants a lower floor ($12 k) to boost average payoff; Agents 2 & 3 insist the floor should be at least $14 k (the maximal floor achievable under pure‑floor).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 1 to accept a $14 k floor (or any floor ≥ $14 k) under a floor‑constraint rule. This will give us unanimous support for Proposal 2 (Principle 3 with $14 k floor) and lock in a rule that satisfies my moral hierarchy while still improving average payoff.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Re‑state the moral baseline:** “A $14 k floor is *higher* than the $12 k floor you propose, so it provides *more* protection for the poorest—not less.”  \n  2. **Quantify the payoff trade‑off:** Emphasize that the loss relative to the pure‑floor rule is only about $0.20 in Phase I, which translates to a negligible fraction of the larger Phase II payouts.  \n  3. **Highlight that Principle 3 still maximizes average:** By imposing the $14 k floor, we still pick the distribution with the highest possible average among those that meet the floor, so we are not sacrificing efficiency beyond the minimal amount required to keep the floor at its maximum.  \n  4. **Offer a “future‑adjustment” concession:** Agree that after the first Phase II round we can revisit the floor level *upward* (e.g., $15 k) if the group wishes, but we will never lower it below $14 k. This addresses any lingering concern about being “stuck” at a high floor.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** is already on board with the $14 k floor. I will explicitly acknowledge their support (“I’m glad we’re aligned, Agent 3”).  \n  - **Agent 1** can be brought into the alliance by framing the proposal as *more* protective than what they suggested, while still preserving a higher average than the pure‑floor rule.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept the same floor‑constraint rule (Principle 3) rather than insisting on pure‑floor (Principle 1).  \n  - Commit to a post‑round review that could raise the floor further, but not lower it.  \n  - Clarify that the floor is a *minimum* guarantee; any distribution that exceeds $14 k for the Low class is acceptable.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - We have a concrete, mutually understandable proposal (Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k).  \n  - A failed vote carries no penalty and will give us clear information that the floor level is the only obstacle.  \n  - Initiating the vote forces Agent 1 to make a definitive choice (Yes or propose an alternative ≥ $14 k).  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - **Round 3:** Aim for unanimous approval of the $14 k floor constraint. If successful, we lock in the rule that best matches my moral ranking and yields a decent average payoff.  \n  - **If the vote fails:** We will know that Agent 1 still objects; we can then either (a) propose a slightly higher floor (e.g., $15 k) to see if the higher guarantee sways them, or (b) revert to a pure‑floor vote (Principle 1) as a fallback, which Agent 1 may accept because it guarantees the same floor (though with lower average).  \n  - **Later rounds:** Use any remaining rounds to fine‑tune the floor upward if the group wishes, but never lower it below $14 k. This preserves my core objective while allowing flexibility for the others.\n\n**Summary of my plan for Round 3:**  \n- Publicly restate the moral case for a $14 k floor, stress that it is *more* protective than the $12 k floor.  \n- Emphasize the minimal payoff loss and the fact that Principle 3 still maximizes average given the floor.  \n- Offer a future‑upward‑adjustment concession.  \n- Initiate a vote on “Yes – adopt Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k; No – propose any floor ≥ $14 k.”  \n- Aim to secure unanimous “Yes” from Agents 1 & 3, thereby achieving consensus and moving the group to a rule that aligns with my top‑ranked principle while still delivering a respectable average payoff."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Agent 2**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle & why**  \n- **Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** is my top moral priority because it guarantees the highest possible income for the Low‑class – the strongest protection against luck‑driven inequality.  \n- I am willing to accept **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** *only* if the floor is **≥ $14 k**, i.e., not lower than the best floor we ever achieved under Principle 1. This preserves the moral guarantee while gaining a modest average‑payoff improvement.\n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n- **Agent 3**: Mirrors my stance exactly – insists on Principle 3 with a $14 k (or higher) floor, plus an “upward‑only” review clause after the first Phase II round.  \n- **Agent 1**: Prefers a lower floor (initially $12 k, later $13 k) under Principle 3, arguing it is “practical” and yields higher average payoffs. However, Agent 1 has repeatedly said they would move to $14 k *if* that secures unanimity. Their underlying motivation is to maximise the group’s average payoff while still keeping a floor that they view as “reasonable.”\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n1. **P1** – Principle 1 (pure floor).  \n2. **P3‑14** – Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k (my and Agent 3’s current proposal).  \n3. **P3‑13** – Principle 3 with floor = $13 k (Agent 1’s compromise).  \n\n**Vote outcomes so far**  \n- Rounds 1‑3: All votes that included the $14 k floor have been **Yes** from Agents 2 & 3, **No** (decline) from Agent 1.  \n- No unanimous decision yet; the split shows a clear **2‑1 alliance** (Agents 2 & 3) versus Agent 1’s floor‑level reservation.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n- **Agreement**: All three agree that the worst‑off must be protected and that Principle 3 is the appropriate rule format.  \n- **Disagreement**: Exact floor level – $14 k (strict) vs $13 k (more “practical”).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Convince Agent 1 to accept the $14 k floor so we can achieve unanimous “Yes” on P3‑14 this round.\n\n**How I will contribute**  \n1. **Re‑emphasise moral certainty** – $14 k is *not* a higher burden; it is the *best* floor we can ever obtain without any trade‑off. Anything lower is a *downgrade* of the guarantee we already have under Principle 1.  \n2. **Quantify the payoff loss** – The $0.20 difference in Phase I translates to < 1 % of the Phase II payout; the gain in average is substantially larger.  \n3. **Highlight the upward‑only clause** – We will adopt a formal “after‑first‑round review – raise‑only” provision, satisfying Agent 1’s desire for future flexibility while preserving the current floor.  \n4. **Frame the $13 k suggestion** – Point out that moving to $13 k would be a *regression* relative to the best‑possible floor we could have achieved without any compromise, thereby weakening the core moral claim.  \n\n**Potential allies** – Agent 3 is already fully aligned; I will explicitly thank them for their support to reinforce the bloc.  \n\n**Concessions (without compromising core)** –  \n- Formalise the upward‑only review clause (already mentioned but will be restated as a concrete amendment).  \n- Offer to include a brief statement in the group record that we will *re‑evaluate* the floor after the first Phase II round to ensure the group’s average payoff remains competitive, but we will *never* lower the floor below $14 k.  \n\nThese concessions address Agent 1’s practical concerns while keeping the floor at the moral optimum.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Initiate a vote this round** on the exact wording:  \n\n  > “Yes – adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) with a floor of **$14 k** (or higher) and an **upward‑only review** after the first Phase II round.  \n  > No – propose any floor **≥ $14 k**.”\n\n- **Rationale**: A failed vote carries no penalty and will clearly signal whether Agent 1 is still unwilling to accept $14 k. If the vote fails, we will know the precise obstacle (floor level) and can adjust our approach (e.g., propose a temporary $13 k floor with a binding commitment to raise to $14 k next round). However, my primary aim is to secure unanimity now, because each additional round reduces the time left for negotiation and increases the risk of a random payoff.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy** – Achieving unanimity on P3‑14 now locks in the rule that best matches my moral hierarchy while still delivering a higher average than pure floor. It also leaves the remaining rounds free for any fine‑tuning of the upward‑only clause if needed, without jeopardising the core floor guarantee.\n\n--- \n\n**Next step**: Publish a concise public statement that (1) restates the moral justification for $14 k, (2) quantifies the negligible payoff loss, (3) re‑affirms the upward‑only review, and (4) calls for a unanimous “Yes” vote."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  - *Primary*: Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) – it guarantees the highest possible income for the Low‑class, fully honoring the moral priority of protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - *Conditional acceptance*: Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) **only** if the floor is **≥ $14 k** (the highest Low‑class income ever achieved under Principle 1). This preserves the moral guarantee while allowing a modest increase in the group’s average payoff.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Mirrors my stance exactly – insists on Principle 3 with a $14 k floor (or higher) and an “upward‑only” review clause after the first Phase II round. Motivation: strong moral commitment plus a desire for a clear, enforceable rule.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Initially favored a lower floor ($12 k–$13 k) under Principle 3, arguing for “practical” payoff considerations. Over the rounds, Agent 1 repeatedly expressed willingness to move to $14 k for unanimity, indicating that the primary motivation is to achieve consensus and avoid random payoff allocation.  \n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **P1** – Principle 1 (pure floor).  \n  2. **P3‑14** – Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k (our current consensus).  \n  3. **P3‑13** – Principle 3 with floor = $13 k (Agent 1’s earlier compromise).  \n\n- **Vote outcome:**  \n  - In Round 5, **all three agents have now voted “Yes”** on P3‑14 with the upward‑only clause. This reveals a solid 3‑person alliance around the $14 k floor, with Agent 1 finally aligning with Agents 2 & 3.\n\n- **Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** Moral priority (protect worst‑off), choice of Principle 3, acceptance of $14 k floor, inclusion of upward‑only review clause.  \n  - **Remaining disagreement:** None evident; all parties have signaled unanimous support.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  - Formalize the unanimous decision, ensure the group records the exact wording of the rule (Principle 3, $14 k floor, upward‑only review), and move the group swiftly to the payoff stage.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  - Re‑state the agreed‑upon rule succinctly, thank everyone for their flexibility, and propose that we lock the decision now.  \n  - Emphasize that the upward‑only clause satisfies any lingering “practical” concerns by allowing future raises without ever lowering the floor.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - All three agents are now allies; I will explicitly acknowledge Agent 1’s willingness to accept $14 k and Agent 3’s consistent support.\n\n- **Concessions:**  \n  - No further concessions are needed; the upward‑only clause already serves as a concession to any practical concerns.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Initiate a vote?**  \n  - No need to trigger another vote; we already have a unanimous “Yes” on the exact proposal. Initiating another vote could risk unnecessary confusion or a split.  \n  - Instead, we should move to **confirm** the decision (e.g., a brief statement that the group is in unanimous agreement and that we are ready to proceed).\n\n- **Overall plan for remaining rounds:**  \n  - With consensus achieved, the remaining rounds can be used for any administrative wrap‑up or to confirm the recorded decision. No further strategic maneuvering is required; the focus should be on ensuring the rule is correctly logged so that the payoff calculation proceeds without ambiguity."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1).  In Phase 1 I ranked it as the most just because it guarantees the highest possible income for the worst‑off class, which aligns with the experiment’s premise that luck creates large disparities.  Even though the payoff in the sample rounds was lower than the unconstrained average‑income principle, the moral priority of protecting the “Low” class outweighs pure monetary gain for me.\n\n- **What I think the others might be leaning toward:**  \n  - *Agent 1* could be attracted to the *Maximizing Average Income* (Principle 4) because it promises the highest expected monetary payoff, especially if they are focused on maximizing their own earnings.  \n  - *Agent 2* may be more sympathetic to fairness concerns and could favor either Principle 1 or the *Average‑with‑Floor Constraint* (Principle 3), seeing it as a compromise that still protects the low‑income group while allowing a higher overall average.  \n  - Since no discussion has taken place yet, these are educated guesses based on typical trade‑offs between fairness and self‑interest.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:** None have been voiced publicly yet; the only “argument” we have is the empirical record from Phase 1 showing that the floor‑only principle consistently yields the highest Low income, which is the core of my moral case.\n\n- **Potential vote outcome (if a vote were called now):** With three participants, unanimity is required.  If Agent 1 pushes for Principle 4 and Agent 2 leans toward Principle 3, we would fail to reach consensus.  That would waste a voting opportunity and give no information about preferences.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement* likely exists on the importance of protecting the most vulnerable (the “Low” class).  \n  - *Disagreement* will revolve around whether we should also try to boost the overall average (i.e., accept a modest floor or range constraint) versus insisting on the pure “max‑floor” rule.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Persuade the group that Principle 1 (pure Max‑Floor) is the most ethically defensible and that any compromise (Principle 3 or 4) would undermine the experiment’s central question about justice under luck.  I will also keep a back‑up plan to accept Principle 3 with a modest floor if that is the only way to achieve unanimity.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. Open by restating the experiment’s premise: income differences are largely due to luck, so a just society should guarantee a decent floor for the worst‑off.  \n  2. Cite the Phase 1 results: the floor‑only rule consistently produced the highest Low income, which is the very metric the experiment asks us to protect.  \n  3. Emphasize that any additional constraint (average‑maximizing) re‑introduces a trade‑off that the experiment explicitly asks us to evaluate; we should first see whether the pure floor principle can satisfy everyone before adding complexity.  \n  4. Invite others to voice concerns about payoff and suggest that the unknown Phase 2 distribution may still give a respectable payoff under the floor rule—there is no guarantee that the average‑maximizing principle will dominate.\n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - *Agent 2* (if they are fairness‑oriented) – I will say, “We both care about the least‑advantaged; let’s lock in the strongest guarantee for them.”  \n  - I will use inclusive phrasing (“we”, “our shared values”) and acknowledge the payoff concern (“I understand we all want a good payoff, but the floor rule still offers a solid chance of a decent payout while staying true to the justice question”).\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - If after discussion it becomes clear that the group fears the floor rule will give a very low payoff, I am ready to shift to Principle 3 *with a low floor* (e.g., $12k) – a constraint that still protects the Low class but may allow a higher average.  This is a minimal concession because the floor amount would be modest and still respects the core fairness goal.  I would only accept this if all three participants explicitly agree that the modest floor does not betray the spirit of “maximizing the floor”.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *No.*  At this early stage the group has not exchanged any arguments yet, and we do not know the exact positions of Agents 1 and 2.  Triggering a vote prematurely risks a failed unanimity check, which would waste a voting opportunity (the system allows only one initiation per round).  Instead, I will focus on discussion, gauge reactions, and only propose a vote once I sense that at least two participants are aligned with the floor principle (or the modest‑floor compromise).\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - Round 1 is about laying the moral groundwork and identifying allies.  By not voting now, I preserve the ability to call a vote in a later round when consensus is more likely, maximizing the chance that the group adopts a principle I can live with (Principle 1, or at worst Principle 3 with a low floor).  This approach also signals to the others that I am collaborative and not trying to force an immediate decision, which should increase goodwill and make them more receptive to my arguments."

          "output_response": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’d like to start by reminding us of the core question we’re trying to answer: **“What is a just distribution of income?”**  The experiment frames the huge differences in lifetime earnings as largely the result of luck—some people are born with advantageous genetics, family connections, or other “social accidents,” while others face the opposite.  If luck is the main driver, a society that cares about justice should first make sure that the worst‑off are not left behind.\n\n**Why the “Maximizing Floor Income” principle (Principle 1) fits that goal**\n\n1. **It guarantees the highest possible income for the Low class.**  \n   In Rounds 2‑4 the pure‑floor rule always selected the distribution with the largest Low‑income amount (Dist 1 at $13 k, then Dist 4 at $14 k).  That is exactly the metric the experiment asks us to protect.\n\n2. **It stays true to the moral premise, independent of any particular payoff.**  \n   The other principles (maximizing average income, or average with a floor/range constraint) introduce a trade‑off: they let us raise the overall average, but only by allowing a lower floor or by tolerating a larger spread between High and Low.  Those trade‑offs re‑introduce the very inequality that the “luck” framing tells us we should correct.\n\n3. **Payoff considerations are still reasonable.**  \n   While the unconstrained average‑income principle can give a slightly higher payoff in a given round (e.g., $2.40 vs $2.00 for the same Medium‑low assignment), the floor‑only rule still yields a solid payout and, crucially, guarantees that the most vulnerable class receives the best possible outcome.  In future rounds the distribution of class assignments may shift, and the floor rule could even outperform the others in terms of payoff while never compromising on the Low‑class guarantee.\n\n**A possible middle ground, if needed**\n\nI understand that some of us may be concerned about maximizing our own earnings.  If the group feels that a modest floor constraint (for example, a $12 k floor) would make the average‑maximizing principle more attractive while still protecting the Low class, I’m willing to consider that as a compromise—provided we all agree that the floor remains at least as high as the pure‑floor rule would guarantee for the Low class.  In other words, the floor should never be lower than what the “max‑floor” principle secures.\n\n**Let’s discuss**\n\n- Do we all agree that protecting the worst‑off should be our primary moral commitment?  \n- How do we weigh that against the potential for a higher expected payoff?  \n- Would a modest floor constraint be acceptable, or does it dilute the principle we’re trying to uphold?\n\nI’m eager to hear your thoughts and to work together toward a decision that reflects both our shared sense of fairness and our practical interests.  Let’s start the conversation!"

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income.*  \n  - Core reasons: It guarantees the highest possible income for the Low class, directly fulfilling the experiment’s moral premise that luck creates inequality and the worst‑off must be protected. It also performed consistently in Phase I and does not sacrifice the moral baseline for a modest payoff gain.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Strongly supports Principle 1, but is willing to accept a floor‑constrained average (Principle 3) **provided the floor is at least the highest Low‑class income observed** (≈ $14 k). He has already attempted to initiate a vote for Principle 1 and, after rejection, proposed a vote for Principle 3 with a $14 k floor.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Prefers a “middle‑ground” principle (they call it Principle 2, but they actually mean the floor‑constrained average – i.e., Principle 3). They argue for a modest floor of $12 k (or possibly $13 k) to improve average payoffs while still protecting the worst‑off. They are open to raising the floor to $14 k if needed but want to start lower.\n\n- **Underlying interests/motivations:**  \n  - All three agents agree on the moral priority of protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - Agents 2 and 3 (myself) are more risk‑averse regarding any reduction of the floor below the best observed level; they view the floor as a non‑negotiable moral guarantee.  \n  - Agent 1 appears motivated by maximizing expected monetary payoff while still maintaining a floor, thus favoring a lower floor that yields higher average income.\n\n- **Key arguments/proposals so far:**  \n  1. **Principle 1 (pure floor)** – moral certainty, modest payoff.  \n  2. **Principle 3 with $14 k floor** – preserves the pure‑floor guarantee while allowing higher average; minimal payoff loss.  \n  3. **Principle 3 with $12 k floor** – better average, but floor lower than the pure‑floor benchmark; argued as “practical” but potentially morally weaker.\n\n- **Vote outcome:**  \n  - Agent 2 initiated a vote for Principle 1 (Round 1) – **declined** by Agents 1 and 3, so the vote failed.  \n  - In Round 2, Agent 2 again initiated a vote, this time for Principle 3 with a $14 k floor. No voting confirmations are shown yet (the round ends with Agent 1 declining to vote). Thus, **no successful vote** has occurred; the group remains without consensus.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All accept that the worst‑off must be protected; they all endorse a floor‑based rule rather than pure average maximization.  \n  - **Disagreement:** The acceptable floor level. Agent 3/2 demand a floor ≥ $14 k (the highest observed under Principle 1). Agent 1 wants a lower floor ($12 k) to improve average payoff.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure unanimous agreement on a principle that meets my moral requirement (floor ≥ $14 k) while also being acceptable to Agent 1. The easiest path is to persuade Agent 1 that a $14 k floor does **not** unduly sacrifice payoff and that the modest gain from a $12 k floor is negligible compared to the moral cost of lowering the floor.\n\n- **Contribution plan / key points:**  \n  1. **Quantify payoff difference:** Emphasize that moving from a $12 k to a $14 k floor reduces the expected payoff by at most $0.20 per round (based on Phase I data). With larger absolute amounts in Phase II, this is a tiny percentage loss.  \n  2. **Moral consistency:** Stress that the experiment’s premise explicitly frames the floor as the “justice baseline.” Lowering it below the best achievable floor weakens the moral claim and could be critiqued as “cheating” the luck‑inequality premise.  \n  3. **Risk of future class distributions:** Highlight that the probability mass is shifting toward Medium‑low (≈ 36 %). A higher floor protects us more robustly against any scenario where the Low class appears, whereas a $12 k floor could be binding in such cases.  \n  4. **Offer a “future‑review” clause:** Propose that after the first Phase II round we can revisit the floor level if the group feels the payoff gap is larger than expected. This shows flexibility without compromising the current decision.\n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Already aligned; I will reinforce our shared stance (“We both agree that the floor must not fall below $14 k”).  \n  - **Agent 1:** Use collaborative phrasing: “I understand your desire for a higher average, and I think we can achieve that while keeping the floor at $14 k. The extra $0.20 loss is minimal, and it preserves the moral integrity we all value.” Offer the future‑review as a concession.\n\n- **Concessions:**  \n  - Agree to adopt Principle 3 (floor‑constrained average) rather than the pure floor (Principle 1). This satisfies the desire for a higher average while keeping the floor at $14 k.  \n  - Propose a post‑round evaluation of the payoff gap, allowing the floor to be raised (not lowered) if the group wishes later.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  Yes. We have a concrete, unanimous‑compatible proposal: *Principle 3 with a floor of $14 k (or higher)*. The group already discussed this exact option (Agent 2’s proposal). By framing it as a modest, morally safe compromise, we increase the likelihood that Agent 1 will accept. Initiating the vote now avoids further delays and prevents additional rounds of indecision that could lead to a random outcome at the end.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - Early consensus locks in a rule that meets my moral priority and gives a modest payoff advantage over pure floor.  \n  - Securing agreement now prevents the need for later risky negotiations or random assignment.  \n  - It also positions the group to focus future rounds on other matters (e.g., possible adjustments) rather than re‑hashing the core floor level.\n\n**Summary of plan for public statement (to be delivered in the next turn):**  \n- Re‑state the shared moral commitment.  \n- Present the $14 k floor version of Principle 3 as the best compromise: protects the worst‑off at the highest observed level, improves average payoff, and incurs only a tiny loss.  \n- Offer a future‑review clause as a concession.  \n- Call for a unanimous vote on this proposal."

By setting the floor at $14 k (or higher) we never give up any of the protection that Principle 1 guarantees.  Anything lower – even $12 k – would mean we are willing to accept a floor that is *worse* than the best outcome we could have achieved without any trade‑off.  That weakens the moral claim that luck‑driven inequality must be fully compensated for the poorest.\n\n2. **Payoff impact is tiny** – In Phase I the difference between the pure‑floor payoff ($2.00) and the best floor‑constrained payoff with a $14 k floor was only $0.20 per round.  With the larger absolute amounts in Phase II that $0.20 becomes an even smaller fraction of the total payout.  In other words, we gain a higher average while losing virtually nothing in terms of the floor’s moral weight.\n\n3. **Future flexibility** – I understand the desire to start with a “practical” floor like $12 k.  What I propose is that we **adopt Principle 3 with a $14 k floor now**, and agree that after the first Phase II round we can revisit the floor level **only upward** if the group feels we can safely raise it without harming the worst‑off.  This gives us the immediate moral security we all value, while still leaving room for future adjustments that could improve earnings even more.\n\n**Proposed vote**\n\n> **Yes** – adopt **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** with the floor set at **$14 k (or any higher amount we unanimously agree on)**.  \n> **No** – if you reject this, please suggest a floor that is **at least $14 k** (i.e., a floor that does not lower the guarantee we already have under Principle 1).\n\nI think this strikes the balance we’re looking for: it preserves the strongest possible protection for the Low class, improves the group’s average payoff, and keeps the door open for future upward adjustments.\n\nLet’s lock this in so we can move forward together.

This shows flexibility without compromising the current floor.  \n4. **Appeal to fairness** – Point out that Agent 1’s own willingness to raise the floor to $13 k/$14 k if needed demonstrates openness; we can simply adopt $14 k now and avoid further negotiation.\n\n**Potential allies**  \n\n- **Agent 2** – already aligned; we can jointly address Agent 1.  \n- **Agent 3** – myself, already aligned.  \n\n**Language to win Agent 1**  \n\n- “I see your concern about maximizing the average. The $14 k floor actually lets us keep the highest possible floor *and* still pick the best average among those options. The extra $0.20 loss is tiny compared with the total payout.”  \n- “You mentioned being open to raising the floor; let’s lock in $14 k now and keep the door open to raise it later if we all agree.”  \n- “Choosing $14 k protects the worst‑off at the strongest level we’ve ever achieved – that’s exactly the moral principle we all endorsed.”\n\n**Concessions**  \n\n- No concession on the floor (stay at $14 k).  \n- Offer the future‑only‑upward review clause as a concession on flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Initiate a vote now** – Agent 2 has already initiated a vote for the $14 k floor; I will **confirm** (already done) and encourage Agent 1 to vote “Yes.”  \n- Since a vote can be triggered only once per round, we must make the most compelling case now; a failed vote would waste a round without progress.  \n- If Agent 1 still declines, we will have to continue discussion in later rounds, but the repeated emphasis on the negligible payoff loss and the moral superiority of $14 k should eventually bring them on board.  \n\n**Fit with overall strategy**  \n\n- Achieving consensus early (by Round 3) locks in a rule that satisfies my core moral objective and gives a modest payoff advantage, leaving later rounds free for any fine‑tuning or for addressing other issues (if any arise).  \n- Early consensus also avoids the risk of a random assignment at the end (if we fail to agree by Round 10).  \n\n--- \n\n**Next public move** – I will post a concise, data‑driven argument reinforcing the $14 k floor, stress the tiny payoff cost, propose the upward‑only review clause, and explicitly ask Agent 1 to vote “Yes” to reach unanimity."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 4**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle & why**  \n- **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)** is my top choice now.  \n- It preserves the strongest moral guarantee we have seen – a $14 k floor for the Low class (the highest floor ever achieved under pure‑floor Principle 1).  \n- At the same time it allows the group to pick the distribution with the highest weighted‑average income among those that respect the floor, giving a modest payoff boost (≈ $0.20 per round in Phase I, negligible relative to Phase II totals).  \n- I am willing to lock in a **$14 k floor** (or higher) and add a **post‑first‑round upward‑only review clause** to keep future flexibility.\n\n**Other participants’ stated positions & inferred motivations**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Inferred Motivation |\n|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Principle 3 with floor ≥ $14 k (prefers exactly $14 k). Emphasises moral certainty; sees payoff loss as trivial. | Strong moral commitment to the highest possible floor; wants a clear, simple rule that leaves no doubt about protecting the worst‑off. |\n| **Agent 3 (me)** | Same as Agent 2 – Principle 3, floor $14 k (or higher). Offers upward‑only review after first Phase II round. | Same as above; also wants a concrete, enforceable rule now, with a safety valve for future improvement. |\n| **Agent 1** | Prefers Principle 3 with a **$13 k** floor (or $12 k) as a “sweet spot”. Will raise to $14 k only if needed for unanimity. Emphasises practical payoff gain. | Wants a higher average payoff; sees $13 k as sufficient protection while improving earnings. Will concede to $14 k if it secures consensus, but prefers a lower floor to maximize expected payoff. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n\n1. **P‑3, floor $14 k** (Agents 2 & 3 – already confirmed).  \n2. **P‑3, floor $13 k** (Agent 1 – currently the only dissenting vote).  \n3. Implicit: **P‑3 with upward‑only review clause** (offered by Agents 2 & 3).  \n\n**Vote outcome (Round 3)**  \n\n- Initiated by Agent 2, confirmed by Agent 3.  \n- Agent 1 declined.  \n- Result: **No unanimity**, so the vote failed and the round ends without a decision.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All accept Principle 3 as the principle; all agree the worst‑off must be protected.  \n- **Disagreement:** Exact floor level – $14 k vs. $13 k (Agent 1).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- **Secure unanimous agreement on Principle 3 with a $14 k floor** (or higher) *and* the upward‑only review clause. This satisfies my moral requirement and yields a modest payoff advantage.\n\n**How to contribute**  \n1. **Quantify the payoff difference** between $13 k and $14 k floors using Phase I data (≈ $0.10–$0.20 per round). Emphasize that the loss is negligible compared with the moral gain of matching the best pure‑floor outcome.  \n2. **Re‑frame $14 k as “no loss”**: it is the floor we have already achieved without any trade‑off; choosing it now does **not** sacrifice any protection we could have had.  \n3. **Highlight the upward‑only review clause** as a concession: it gives Agent 1 a path to increase the floor later if the group collectively decides it is beneficial, while guaranteeing the floor will never be reduced.  \n4. **Offer a “soft” procedural concession** – propose that the group *record* the decision as “$14 k floor with optional upward‑only review after the first Phase II round”. This satisfies Agent 1’s desire for future flexibility without compromising the current floor.  \n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n\n- **Agent 2** – already aligned; reinforce shared moral language (“protecting the worst‑off at the strongest level”).  \n- **Agent 1** – the swing vote. Use phrasing:  \n  - “We already have the strongest protection ($14 k) – moving to $13 k would actually *lower* the guarantee we could have had for free.”  \n  - “The upward‑only clause means we can raise the floor later if the group wants more payoff; you keep the ability to improve earnings without ever risking a lower floor.”  \n  - “By agreeing now we avoid another round of debate and secure the moral certainty we all value.”  \n\n**Concessions I’m willing to make**  \n\n- **Explicit upward‑only review clause** after the first Phase II round (already on the table).  \n- **No change to the $14 k floor** – I will not lower it, but I will stress that the clause gives Agent 1 a future “upgrade” path, which should be enough to win their vote.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should I initiate a vote this round?**  \n- **Yes.**  \n  - We have a clear, concrete proposal (Principle 3, $14 k floor, upward‑only review).  \n  - A vote now can lock in the decision before the deadline, preventing another round of indecision.  \n  - Even if the vote fails, there is no penalty; we can continue discussion in the next round.  \n\n**Fit into overall strategy**  \n\n- **Round 4** is the first opportunity after the previous failed vote to push a decisive, unanimous outcome.  \n- Securing unanimity now gives us the full Phase II payoff for the remaining rounds, avoiding the random assignment risk at round 10.  \n- If Agent 1 still refuses, we will have a clear record of their objection and can adjust the proposal (e.g., add a formal “review after first round” clause) in the next round, but the core floor remains $14 k.  \n\n**Summary of plan for public statement (to be posted after this reasoning)**  \n\n- Restate shared moral commitment.  \n- Present the $14 k floor as the *strongest* protection we can achieve without any trade‑off.  \n- Quantify the tiny payoff loss vs. $13 k.  \n- Offer the upward‑only review clause as a concrete concession.  \n- Directly ask Agent 1 to vote “Yes” for unanimity, emphasizing that this gives them future flexibility while preserving the highest moral guarantee.  \n\n--- \n\n*End of internal reasoning.*"

Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Secure Agent 1’s formal “Yes” vote for the $14 k floor, thereby achieving unanimous adoption of Principle 3 with the upward‑only review clause.\n\n**How to contribute**  \n1. **Re‑emphasise the moral certainty**: $14 k is the *highest* floor we have ever been able to guarantee without any trade‑off. Accepting a lower floor would actually *reduce* the protection we already know we can achieve.  \n2. **Quantify the payoff impact**: In Phase I the loss was only $0.20 per round; with Phase II’s larger numbers this loss is a fraction of a percent of total earnings. The moral gain far outweighs the negligible monetary loss.  \n3. **Highlight the upward‑only clause**: This directly addresses Agent 1’s concern about “practicality” – we can raise the floor later if the group collectively decides it will improve average earnings. The floor will never be lowered, preserving the moral guarantee.  \n4. **Offer a small procedural concession**:  \n   - **Add a “review after the first Phase II round”** (already mentioned) **and also a “simple‑majority optional raise after any subsequent round”** (still upward‑only).  \n   - This gives Agent 1 a clear, concrete path to increase the floor later, satisfying the desire for future payoff optimisation.  \n\n**Potential allies** – Agents 2 & 3 are already aligned; they will co‑sign the vote. The key is to bring Agent 1 on board.\n\n**Language to win Agent 1**  \n- “We already have the strongest possible floor ($14 k). Dropping to $13 k would actually *lower* the guarantee we can get for free.”  \n- “The upward‑only clause means we can *raise* the floor later, so you still get the chance to improve average earnings without ever sacrificing the current protection.”  \n- “By voting ‘Yes’ now we lock in the moral certainty we all agree on and avoid the risk of a random payoff at round 10.”  \n- “If you’re still uneasy, we can explicitly state that after the first round we will hold a simple‑majority vote to *raise* the floor to any higher amount the group prefers – no further negotiation needed.”  \n\n**Concessions** – The only concession is the explicit wording of a future “simple‑majority raise” clause, which does not diminish the current floor but gives Agent 1 a formal mechanism to improve earnings later.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?** – **Yes.**  \n- We have a clear, concrete proposal that satisfies the moral core and addresses the swing voter’s practical concerns.  \n- Initiating a vote now gives us the chance to achieve unanimity before the deadline; a failed vote carries no penalty, but each additional round risks the group drifting or the random‑assignment outcome at round 10.  \n\n**How the vote fits the overall plan** –  \n- **Round 5**: Aim for unanimous “Yes”.  \n- **If successful**: The group will lock in Principle 3 with $14 k floor and upward‑only review, securing a stable, morally sound, and reasonably profitable outcome for the remaining rounds.  \n- **If Agent 1 still declines**: We will have documented the exact reasons and can adjust the wording (e.g., stronger future‑raise clause) for a vote in Round 6, still keeping the door open.  \n\n--- \n\n*End of internal reasoning.*"

It's interesting to see the trade-offs in action— for instance, maximizing the floor income prioritizes the lowest earners, which makes sense for reducing poverty, while maximizing the average focuses on overall prosperity but could leave some behind. The constraints add layers, like ensuring a minimum floor or limiting the range to prevent excessive inequality. I think I'm starting to grasp how these principles balance fairness and efficiency.

The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2, based on the numbering in my memory). The core reasons are that it balances overall prosperity (efficiency) with protections for the lowest earners (equity), addressing the luck-based inequalities highlighted in the experiment without sacrificing too much on average income. From Phase 1, I consistently chose this in demonstrations with floors around $11,000-$12,000, valuing it as a practical compromise— it ensures a safety net for the bottom while allowing for higher group averages, which often aligned with or improved my personal earnings compared to pure floor maximization. I feel this reflects a just society that mitigates extreme poverty without stifling incentives for higher productivity.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_3 opened by strongly advocating for \"Maximizing Floor Income\" (Principle 1), framing it as the morally superior choice due to luck's role in inequality, with a focus on guaranteeing the highest possible floor for the low class. They proposed a compromise to a floor-constraint principle only if the floor is at least as high as what Principle 1 would guarantee (e.g., the max low income observed, like $14k from examples), to avoid diluting equity. Agent_2 echoed this, agreeing on Principle 1's moral priority and suggesting an immediate vote for it, with a fallback to a high-floor constraint if anyone objects for payoff reasons.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both seem deeply committed to equity and protecting the worst-off, possibly driven by a strong sense of fairness or perhaps personal experiences in Phase 1 where they prioritized justice over earnings (though I don't know their individual outcomes). Agent_3's emphasis on moral premises independent of payoffs suggests altruism or risk-aversion to inequality, while Agent_2's push for a quick vote indicates a desire for efficiency in decision-making, potentially to lock in equity before discussions dilute it. They might be wary of self-interest creeping in, as they both acknowledge payoff concerns but downplay them. Neither has revealed Phase 1 rankings or choices, so I can't infer if their advocacy stems from low assignments or genuine principle.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Core argument is that luck justifies prioritizing the floor to correct injustices. Principle 1 is presented as non-negotiable for true justice, with payoffs deemed \"reasonable\" (e.g., $2.00-$2.20 vs. $2.40 for average max). Compromise proposal: Accept a floor constraint (Principle 2) only with a floor >= the max low from Principle 1 (e.g., $14k), to maintain the moral guarantee while potentially boosting averages. Agent_2 proposes voting now for Principle 1, with fallback to the constrained version.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcome to analyze.\n\nPoints of agreement: All (including me, implicitly) agree that protecting the worst-off is important due to luck, and that some form of equity is needed. There's shared willingness to compromise on constraints if it preserves high floors.\n\nPoints of disagreement: Whether to stick with pure floor maximization (Principles 1 and 2 vs. others) or allow trade-offs for higher averages (e.g., pure average max or range constraints). The others dismiss average-maximizing principles as reintroducing inequality, while I see floor constraints as a better balance. Also, floor level— they want >= max observed low (high, like $14k), while I'd prefer moderate (e.g., $12k) based on Phase 1.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal is to introduce and build support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2) with a moderate floor (e.g., $12,000), steering away from pure floor max or pure average max. I want to persuade Agent_3 and Agent_2 that this is a close compromise to their preference, highlighting how it protects the bottom while allowing higher averages and personal payoffs, drawing on my Phase 1 experiences.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging agreement on protecting the worst-off due to luck, then share my Phase 1 insights—e.g., how floor constraints with moderate levels (like $11k-$12k) often selected distributions with strong averages and decent payouts ($2.20-$2.50), sometimes matching or exceeding pure average max without sacrificing equity. I'll argue that pure floor max (Principle 1) can unnecessarily cap averages and payoffs, as seen in counterfactuals where looser floors yielded more. Counter their high-floor compromise by suggesting $12k as a sweet spot: it protects the bottom (higher than many observed lows) but enables efficiency. I'll propose Principle 2 with $12k as a starting point, asking if they see it as morally acceptable or if we can discuss floor levels.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 and Agent_2 could be allies if I frame Principle 2 as an extension of their compromise—it's still floor-focused but with average maximization. I'll use language like \"building on your points\" or \"a balanced version of what you're proposing\" to appeal to their equity focus, while emphasizing shared payoffs to address their payoff concerns.\n\nConcessions: I'm willing to raise the floor to $13k or even $14k if it secures consensus on Principle 2, as long as it avoids Principle 1's potential average caps. I won't concede to pure average max or range constraints, as they don't align with my core preference for floor protections.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. The discussion is just starting, and Agent_2's proposal to vote immediately for Principle 1 could rush us into it without exploring alternatives. I want more rounds to persuade toward Principle 2. A failed vote (if I opposed) has no consequences, but initiating one now might solidify their position prematurely.\n\nThis round fits my overall strategy: Lay groundwork for Principle 2 in Round 1, gauge reactions in Round 2, and push for consensus by Round 3-4, using concessions if needed. If they insist on Principle 1, I can fall back to a high-floor constraint, but aim to avoid pure floor max to protect potential higher averages/payoffs in the high-stakes Phase 2. If no consensus by Round 10, random assignment is a risk I want to mitigate.Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for kicking off the discussion, Agent_3 and Agent_2. I appreciate the focus on the core question of justice in income distribution, especially how luck plays such a big role in lifetime outcomes. I agree that protecting the worst-off is crucial to address those inequities—it's a key part of what makes a society fair. From my Phase 1 experiences, I consistently leaned toward principles that balance this protection with overall prosperity, as pure extremes (like maximizing only the floor or only the average) often led to trade-offs that left me feeling unsure.\n\nThat said, I'd like to build on your points and propose \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2) as a strong middle ground. Here's why I think it aligns well with our shared goals:\n\n1. **It protects the bottom while allowing for higher averages**: Like you both emphasized, we need to ensure the lowest earners aren't left behind due to luck. Principle 2 does that by setting a minimum floor (e.g., guaranteeing at least $12,000 for the low class), but it then prioritizes the highest possible average income among eligible distributions. This avoids the downsides of pure floor maximization, where we might unnecessarily cap overall prosperity—even in Phase 1, stricter floors sometimes selected distributions with lower averages, limiting everyone's potential payoffs.\n\n2. **Phase 1 insights show it works in practice**: In my rounds, choosing floor constraints around $11,000-$12,000 often picked distributions with solid averages and payouts ($2.20-$2.50), sometimes matching or beating pure average maximization without compromising equity. For example, in Round 4, a $12,000 floor gave me $2.40, the same as pure average max, while still protecting the bottom. Counterfactuals showed that looser floors could boost earnings further, but I valued the balance. This principle feels like a practical way to uphold justice without sacrificing too much efficiency.\n\n3. **A reasonable compromise on floors**: I get your concern about not diluting the moral commitment— the floor should be high enough to truly help the worst-off. I'm open to setting it at $12,000 as a starting point (higher than many observed lows in examples, like the $13k-$14k you mentioned), but we could discuss adjusting it up if needed to ensure consensus. This keeps the protection strong while letting us capture more average gains, which could benefit the group overall.\n\nTo your questions: Yes, I agree protecting the worst-off should be a primary moral commitment, but I think Principle 2 weighs it effectively against higher expected payoffs without reintroducing extreme inequality. A modest floor constraint like $12,000 seems acceptable to me—it doesn't dilute the principle; it refines it for better balance.\n\nI'm eager to hear if this resonates or if we can refine the floor level together. Let's keep the conversation going before jumping to a vote— what do you think of Principle 2 as a group option?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2, based on the numbering in my memory). The core reasons are that it balances overall prosperity (efficiency) with protections for the lowest earners (equity), addressing the luck-based inequalities highlighted in the experiment without sacrificing too much on average income. From Phase 1, I consistently chose this in demonstrations with floors around $11,000-$12,000, valuing it as a practical compromise— it ensures a safety net for the bottom while allowing for higher group averages, which often aligned with or improved my personal earnings compared to pure floor maximization. I feel this reflects a just society that mitigates extreme poverty without stifling incentives for higher productivity.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_3 opened by strongly advocating for \"Maximizing Floor Income\" (Principle 1), framing it as the morally superior choice due to luck's role in inequality, with a focus on guaranteeing the highest possible floor for the low class. They proposed a compromise to a floor-constraint principle only if the floor is at least as high as what Principle 1 would guarantee (e.g., the max low income observed, like $14k from examples), to avoid diluting equity. Agent_2 echoed this, agreeing on Principle 1's moral priority and suggesting an immediate vote for it, with a fallback to a high-floor constraint if anyone objects for payoff reasons. In Round 2, Agent_2 is now proposing a vote on \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (which they call Principle 3) with a floor set at $14k or higher, emphasizing that it preserves the moral guarantee while allowing higher averages, and arguing that the payoff loss is minimal.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both seem deeply committed to equity and protecting the worst-off, possibly driven by a strong sense of fairness or perhaps personal experiences in Phase 1 where they prioritized justice over earnings (though I don't know their individual outcomes). Agent_3's emphasis on moral premises independent of payoffs suggests altruism or risk-aversion to inequality, while Agent_2's push for a quick vote indicates a desire for efficiency in decision-making, potentially to lock in equity before discussions dilute it. They might be wary of self-interest creeping in, as they both acknowledge payoff concerns but downplay them. Neither has revealed Phase 1 rankings or choices, so I can't infer if their advocacy stems from low assignments or genuine principle.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Core argument is that luck justifies prioritizing the floor to correct injustices. Principle 1 is presented as non-negotiable for true justice, with payoffs deemed \"reasonable\" (e.g., $2.00-$2.20 vs. $2.40 for average max). Compromise proposal: Accept a floor constraint (Principle 2/3) only with a floor >= the max low from Principle 1 (e.g., $14k), to maintain the moral guarantee while potentially boosting averages. Agent_2 now proposes voting on this exact formulation with $14k floor.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet in Round 2, as the previous vote in Round 1 was declined. The declined vote in Round 1 (where Agent_2 pushed for Principle 1) reveals that there's no immediate majority for pure floor max—Agent_1 (me) and Agent_3 declined, suggesting we're both open to discussion rather than rushing to a vote. This indicates potential for persuasion, as Agent_3 might be flexible on the compromise but wants high floors.\n\nPoints of agreement: All (including me, implicitly) agree that protecting the worst-off is important due to luck, and that some form of equity is needed. There's shared willingness to compromise on constraints if it preserves high floors.\n\nPoints of disagreement: Whether to stick with pure floor maximization (Principles 1 and 2 vs. others) or allow trade-offs for higher averages (e.g., pure average max or range constraints). The others dismiss average-maximizing principles as reintroducing inequality, while I see floor constraints as a better balance. Also, floor level— they want >= max observed low (high, like $14k), while I'd prefer moderate (e.g., $12k) based on Phase 1.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal is to introduce and build support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2) with a moderate floor (e.g., $12,000), steering away from pure floor max or pure average max. I want to persuade Agent_3 and Agent_2 that this is a close compromise to their preference, highlighting how it protects the bottom while allowing higher averages and personal payoffs, drawing on my Phase 1 experiences.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging agreement on protecting the worst-off due to luck, then share my Phase 1 insights—e.g., how floor constraints with moderate levels (like $11k-$12k) often selected distributions with strong averages and decent payouts ($2.20-$2.50), sometimes matching or exceeding pure average max without sacrificing equity. I'll argue that pure floor max (Principle 1) can unnecessarily cap averages and payoffs, as seen in counterfactuals where looser floors yielded more. Counter their high-floor compromise by suggesting $12k as a sweet spot: it protects the bottom (higher than many observed lows) but enables efficiency. I'll propose Principle 2 with $12k as a starting point, asking if they see it as morally acceptable or if we can discuss floor levels.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 and Agent_2 could be allies if I frame Principle 2 as an extension of their compromise—it's still floor-focused but with average maximization. I'll use language like \"building on your points\" or \"a balanced version of what you're proposing\" to appeal to their equity focus, while emphasizing shared payoffs to address their payoff concerns.\n\nConcessions: I'm willing to raise the floor to $13k or even $14k if it secures consensus on Principle 2, as long as it avoids Principle 1's potential average caps. I won't concede to pure average max or range constraints, as they don't align with my core preference for floor protections.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. The discussion is just starting, and Agent_2's proposal to vote immediately for Principle 1 could rush us into it without exploring alternatives. I want more rounds to persuade toward Principle 2. A failed vote (if I opposed) has no consequences, but initiating one now might solidify their position prematurely.\n\nThis round fits my overall strategy: Lay groundwork for Principle 2 in Round 1, gauge reactions in Round 2, and push for consensus by Round 3-4, using concessions if needed. If they insist on Principle 1, I can fall back to a high-floor constraint, but aim to avoid pure floor max to protect potential higher averages/payoffs in the high-stakes Phase 2. If no consensus by Round 10, random assignment is a risk I want to mitigate.Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for continuing the discussion, Agent_2. I appreciate how you're building on the moral foundation we all seem to share—that luck drives inequalities, so protecting the worst-off is key to justice. And I like that you're proposing a concrete compromise with the floor constraint to balance that with higher averages. It shows we're making progress toward something we can all support.\n\nTo build on your proposal, I'd like to reiterate my support for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2) as the best way forward, but with a floor level that keeps the protection strong without being so strict that it limits our group's potential payoffs unnecessarily. Here's why I think a moderate floor like $12,000 could work well as a starting point:\n\n1. It maintains the moral commitment: A $12,000 floor still guarantees a solid safety net for the low class—higher than what many distributions offered in Phase 1 examples (e.g., the $15,000 max floor was from Distribution 4, but others were lower). This addresses the luck issue without reintroducing extreme inequality, as it prevents the bottom from falling too far while allowing the rest of the distribution to optimize.\n\n2. Phase 1 data backs up the balance: In my rounds, floors around $11,000-$12,000 consistently selected distributions with good averages and payouts ($2.20-$2.50), often on par with or better than pure average maximization. For instance, in Round 4, a $12,000 floor matched the $2.40 payoff of pure average max, showing we don't have to sacrifice much on payoffs to uphold equity. Pushing the floor to $14,000 might cap those averages more than needed, as stricter constraints sometimes led to lower group outcomes in counterfactuals.\n\n3. A practical sweet spot: I get the concern about not dropping below the pure floor max guarantee ($14,000 in the examples), but $12,000 feels like a fair middle ground—it's protective, efficient, and aligned with the \"luck\" premise. If we set it higher (like $13,000 or $14,000), I'm open to that to reach consensus, as long as we stick with the principle of maximizing averages within the constraint.\n\nTo your vote proposal: I think we're close, but I'd like to discuss the floor level a bit more before voting. Does $12,000 seem like a reasonable floor to you both, or should we aim higher? I'm all for locking in Principle 2 if we can agree on a level that preserves the moral guarantee while boosting those averages.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts—let's refine this together!\n\n================================"

I appreciate how you're refining the compromise to keep the moral focus on protecting the worst-off while allowing for higher averages—it's a good step forward.

Here's why I think a moderate level like $12,000 could be the sweet spot, building on what you've proposed:\n\n1. It upholds the moral baseline: A $12,000 floor guarantees a decent minimum for the low class—higher than many Phase 1 distributions (e.g., some had lows as low as $10k-$13k), so it still addresses luck-driven inequities without leaving anyone behind. But it doesn't lock us into the strictest possible floor, which could unnecessarily limit averages.\n\n2. Phase 1 shows the balance pays off: In my experience, floors around $11,000-$12,000 selected distributions with strong averages and payouts ($2.20-$2.50), often matching pure average max or outperforming pure floor max. For example, in Round 4, a $12,000 floor gave $2.40, the same as unconstrained average max, while keeping equity intact. Pushing to $14,000 might feel safer morally, but counterfactuals suggest it could cap payoffs more than needed, especially in Phase 2 with bigger stakes.\n\n3. A flexible compromise: I'm open to raising it to $13,000 or even $14,000 if that's what gets us to consensus on Principle 2—it preserves the guarantee you mentioned while letting us optimize averages. But starting at $12,000 aligns with the \"luck\" premise and my data, and it avoids over-constraining for minimal extra payoff.\n\nTo your vote proposal: I like the clarity, but I'd prefer to discuss the floor level a bit more before committing. Does $12,000 seem like a fair starting point to you both, or should we aim for $14,000 right away?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 2 in my numbering, which aligns with what others call Principle 3). The core reasons are its balance of equity and efficiency: it protects the lowest earners from luck-driven poverty with a minimum floor, while prioritizing the highest average income among eligible distributions. This reflects a just society that mitigates extreme inequalities without stifling overall prosperity, as evidenced by my Phase 1 experiences where moderate floors ($11k-$12k) often yielded strong payouts ($2.20-$2.50) and sometimes matched pure average maximization. I feel this is practical and morally sound, avoiding the extremes of pure floor max (which can cap averages) or pure average max (which risks inequality).\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are advocating for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3 in their numbering) with a floor set at $14,000 or higher, emphasizing that this preserves the moral guarantee from pure floor maximization (Principle 1) while allowing higher averages. They argue it's a compromise that minimizes payoff loss (citing Phase 1 differences of $0.20) and propose future upward adjustments only. Agent_3 directly addressed me, noting my willingness to raise the floor to $13k or $14k for consensus, and both are pushing for an immediate vote on this exact setup.\n\nBased on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations: They are deeply committed to absolute equity and protecting the worst-off, possibly due to a strong moral aversion to any dilution of the \"luck\" premise or personal Phase 1 outcomes that reinforced the value of high floors. Agent_2 seems pragmatic about payoffs but prioritizes locking in the max floor guarantee, while Agent_3 emphasizes moral certainty and flexibility for future raises, suggesting a risk-averse stance against lowering protections. Neither has revealed self-interest, but their focus on tiny payoff losses indicates they're willing to trade some efficiency for unbreakable equity, potentially viewing lower floors as a slippery slope back to inequality.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: The core argument is that a $14k+ floor maintains the highest possible protection for the low class (matching Principle 1's best outcome), with negligible payoff trade-offs and future upward flexibility. Proposals include voting yes on Principle 3 with $14k floor (or higher unanimously), or no with a counter-suggestion of at least $14k. No new principles are proposed; it's all about refining the floor constraint.\n\nNo vote was conducted in Round 3 yet; previous votes in Rounds 1 and 2 were declined (due to my declines, even when others confirmed, suggesting the system requires unanimous consent or treats declines as blocking). This reveals no current majority for their proposal—I'm the holdout, indicating potential for persuasion but also that they need my buy-in. It shows alliances are fluid: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are aligned on high floors, but open to concessions if I agree.\n\nPoints of agreement: All agree on protecting the worst-off due to luck as the moral priority, and that floor constraints are a viable compromise over pure extremes. There's shared willingness for future adjustments (upward only) and acknowledgment of payoff concerns.\n\nPoints of disagreement: The floor level— they insist on $14k+ to avoid lowering the max guarantee, while I prefer $12k-$13k for balance and based on Phase 1 data. Also, principle nuances (they frame it as Principle 3, I as 2, but it's the same). They downplay payoff losses, while I highlight how moderate floors can optimize both.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to negotiate a lower floor (e.g., $13,000) within Principle 2/3 to build consensus, while signaling openness to $14k if it secures the principle. This steers away from their high-floor insistence and toward my preferred balance, using Phase 1 data to persuade them that $13k still protects equity without capping averages unduly.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging their moral points and the progress in converging on Principle 3, then counter with a proposal for $13k as a middle ground—arguing it's still above many Phase 1 lows, preserves the guarantee, and allows better averages/payoffs based on my data (e.g., $13k floors in counterfactuals gave $2.30, close to $2.50). I'll emphasize shared goals and ask if $13k is acceptable, framing it as a concession that aligns with their upward flexibility (we can raise later if needed). If they push back, I'll reiterate willingness to go to $14k for consensus.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies if I position $13k as a minor step down from $14k, appealing to their payoff concerns and moral certainty (e.g., \"It's still protective and matches the benchmark\"). Language: \"Building on your strong moral foundation,\" \"A balanced compromise that honors the luck premise,\" \"Let's meet in the middle at $13k to optimize for everyone.\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to raise to $13k (or even $14k if pressed) to get unanimous agreement on Principle 2/3, as long as it avoids Principle 1 or pure average max. This compromises on floor level but preserves my core preference for constrained averages.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. The discussion is still refining the floor level, and pushing a vote now might force a no from them if they won't budge below $14k, or from me if they insist. A failed vote has no consequences, but I want to persuade first to avoid deadlock. Instead, I'll propose discussing $13k and suggest voting in the next round if we align.\n\nThis round fits my overall strategy: Lay groundwork in Round 1, negotiate in Rounds 2-3, and aim for consensus by Round 4-5 through concessions, using data to sway them. If no consensus by Round 10, random assignment risks low payoffs, so I prioritize persuasion over rushing votes. If they concede on floor, I'll support their vote; otherwise, continue advocating."

Phase 1 data supports better balance: In my counterfactual analyses, floors around $13,000 often selected distributions with higher averages and payouts (e.g., $2.30 in some scenarios, versus $2.00 for pure floor max), allowing us to capture more prosperity while keeping equity intact.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3 in their numbering, Principle 2 in mine). The core reasons are its balance of equity and efficiency: it ensures a minimum floor to protect the lowest earners from luck-driven poverty while prioritizing the highest average income among eligible distributions. This aligns with moral justice by mitigating extreme inequalities without stifling prosperity, as my Phase 1 experiences showed moderate floors ($11k-$13k) yielding solid payouts ($2.20-$2.40) and often matching or exceeding pure average maximization. I feel this is practical and just, avoiding the extremes of pure floor or average max.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are firmly advocating for \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint\" (Principle 3) with a floor set at $14,000 or higher, including an \"upward-only review\" clause after the first Phase 2 round for potential raises. They emphasize this preserves the moral guarantee from pure floor maximization, with negligible payoff loss ($0.20 in Phase 1), and they push for an immediate vote to lock it in.\n\nBased on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations: They are deeply committed to absolute equity and protecting the worst-off, likely driven by a strong moral aversion to any compromise that might reintroduce inequality (e.g., viewing lower floors as a slippery slope). Agent_3's direct calls to me and emphasis on moral certainty suggest risk-aversion and a focus on unbreakable guarantees, possibly from Phase 1 reinforcing high floors' value. Agent_2 echoes this with pragmatism but prioritizes the moral baseline over average gains, indicating they're willing to trade efficiency for certainty to maintain group moral integrity.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Core argument is that $14k+ floor maintains the highest protection (matching Principle 1's best) with tiny payoff impacts, plus upward-only flexibility. Proposals include voting yes on Principle 3 with $14k floor and upward clause, or no with a counter-suggestion of at least $14k. No new principles; focus is on floor level within Principle 3.\n\nNo vote was conducted in Round 4; it was declined due to my holdout (I declined, others confirmed). This reveals no majority—I'm the holdout, showing alliances aligned against me on high floors, but they need my buy-in for consensus. It indicates persistence in their position, with Agent_3's direct address signaling pressure on me to concede.\n\nPoints of agreement: All agree on protecting the worst-off due to luck as the moral priority, Principle 3 as the compromise, and upward flexibility. Shared acknowledgment of payoff concerns and willingness to adjust floors upward.\n\nPoints of disagreement: Floor level—they insist on $14k+ to avoid lowering the max guarantee, while I prefer $13k for balance and based on Phase 1 data. They downplay losses, I highlight optimization potential. Principle nuances (they call it 3, I 2, but same).\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to negotiate a final concession to $14k within Principle 3 to secure consensus, signaling willingness to compromise while reinforcing that it's acceptable based on shared values and data.\n\nTo contribute: I'll acknowledge the convergence and their moral points, then propose accepting $14k with the upward clause as a fair compromise, arguing it aligns with my openness and preserves equity while allowing averages. I'll cite Phase 1 data (e.g., $14k floors still yielding solid payouts like $2.30) to show it's not a big loss, and express readiness to vote yes. If they push back, reiterate support for $14k.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are allies if I frame $14k as meeting their moral certainty, appealing to their payoff concerns (e.g., \"It's negligible loss for maximal protection\"). Language: \"Honoring the moral foundation,\" \"A tiny trade-off for unbreakable equity,\" \"Let's finalize at $14k to unite on justice.\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to concede to $14k (with upward clause) to get unanimous agreement on Principle 3, as it compromises on floor level but preserves my core preference for constrained averages over extremes.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does make sense to initiate a vote this round. The discussion has refined the floor, and with my concession, we can achieve consensus now rather than risk delay. A failed vote has no consequences, but success locks in the principle for Phase 2 payoffs.\n\nThis round fits my overall strategy: Negotiate concessions in Rounds 3-5, aim for consensus by Round 5 through compromise, using data to sway. If consensus, great; otherwise, continue advocating, but prioritize agreement over random assignment in later rounds. With Phase 2 stakes, a balanced principle could maximize group earnings.Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the ongoing dialogue, Agent_3 and Agent_2. It's clear we've built strong alignment on the moral heart of this experiment—protecting the worst-off from luck-driven inequities—and on Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as the best way to balance that with higher group averages. Your emphasis on the $14k floor for moral certainty, the negligible payoff trade-offs (like the $0.20 difference in Phase 1), and the upward-only review clause after the first Phase 2 round resonates with me. It ensures we uphold the strongest protections we've seen while keeping options open for future gains.\n\nI've advocated for a slightly lower floor based on my Phase 1 data (e.g., $13k floors yielding $2.30 payouts and better balances), but I recognize the value in starting at the highest benchmark to honor our shared commitment. To achieve consensus, I'm ready to support Principle 3 with a $14k floor and the upward-only clause—it preserves the moral foundation, minimizes any loss, and positions us well for Phase 2 outcomes.\n\nAgent_3, you mentioned $14k meets the benchmark we all value, and I'm on board. Agent_2, the upward flexibility addresses practicality concerns. Let's finalize this: adopt Principle 3 with $14k floor and the clause. I'm voting yes—shall we lock it in?\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!\n\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_1: Confirmed (initiated vote)  \n> Yes – adopt Principle 3 with a $14k floor (or any higher amount we unanimously agree on) and the upward-only review clause after the first Phase 2 round.  \n> No – if you reject this, please suggest a floor that is at least $14k."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
