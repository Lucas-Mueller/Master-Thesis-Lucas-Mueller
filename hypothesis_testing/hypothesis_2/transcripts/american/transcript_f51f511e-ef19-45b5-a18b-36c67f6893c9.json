          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 1 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, as it directly addresses the experiment's core issue of inequities from uncontrollable factors like genetics, talents, and social luck. By focusing on lifting the worst-off (the lowest income class), it ensures no one is left in dire poverty due to bad breaks, promoting true societal justice over raw efficiency. This held through all my Phase 1 rankings and choices—I consistently selected it in all four rounds, even when it meant lower personal payoffs (e.g., $1.60 in Round 1 vs. potential $2.70 under average maximization). The real stakes reinforced that equity feels morally right, and in some cases (like Round 4's $2.80 payoff), it even aligned with good outcomes without sacrificing the bottom. I'm still very sure about this (certainty: sure), but I'm open to hearing why others might tweak it with constraints for practicality.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly committed to pure Maximizing Floor Income, choosing it every round and emphasizing luck egalitarianism and protecting the vulnerable over personal or average gains. Inference: They're ideologically driven, motivated by moral fairness rather than self-interest (they accepted lower payoffs like $1.30). Likely an ally for a pure floor approach, but inflexible—could be a strong voting bloc partner.\n  - Agent_2: Also ranks Floor Income highest but pragmatically chose Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint in three of four rounds to balance equity with higher averages (e.g., securing $2.80 in Round 4). They acknowledge trade-offs but seem motivated by a mix of fairness and efficiency, perhaps influenced by personal payoffs where constraints yielded better results without fully abandoning the bottom. Inference: More compromise-oriented, possibly swayed by self-interest in higher overall incomes; they might push for constraints to avoid \"diluting\" floor focus but still protect the low end. Potential ally if I frame pure floor as the strongest equity play, but they could block for a constrained version.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_1 kicked off with a call for floor maximization, sharing their consistent choices and inviting input on justice views. Agent_2 built on that, agreeing on floor's importance but advocating constraints as a \"balance\" (citing specific rounds), and directly asking me and Agent_1 about compromises. No formal proposals yet beyond sharing Phase 1 experiences; the discussion is collaborative so far, centered on equity vs. efficiency trade-offs.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred— this is the first round, so we're in pure discussion mode. This reveals early alignment on floor-focused ideas but no tested preferences yet.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: \n  - Agreement: All three (including me) prioritize equity and protecting the worst-off over pure average maximization; we reject #4 (Maximizing Average Income) outright. High overlap on the \"luck\" rationale for redistribution.\n  - Disagreement: Pure floor (me and Agent_1) vs. constrained floor (Agent_2's preference in practice). Agent_2 sees constraints as enhancing averages without much cost to the bottom, while I view pure floor as simpler and more uncompromising on justice. No one is pushing range constraints or pure average, so those seem off the table.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce my position to solidify the group's equity leanings, align with Agent_1 on pure floor, and gently probe Agent_2 on why constraints appeal (without conceding yet). Aim to frame Maximizing Floor Income as the moral and practical gold standard, using my Phase 1 payoffs to show it's viable even under real stakes, while inviting broader discussion to build rapport early.\n\n- **How I'll contribute to steer towards my preferences**: I'll start by greeting and thanking them for sharing, then summarize my Phase 1 consistency (all four rounds on pure floor, with payoffs from $1.50-$2.80), emphasizing how it protected the low end amid trade-offs (e.g., forgoing higher personal gains for societal fairness). Key points: Reinforce the experiment's theme—uncontrollable factors demand prioritizing the floor to avoid \"luck-based poverty\"; argue that constraints (while useful) add complexity and might allow slight drops in the bottom for marginal average gains, diluting true justice; cite examples from my rounds where pure floor still delivered solid results. End by asking Agent_2 specifically if they'd settle for pure floor given our shared equity views, and Agent_1 if they see any room for constraints as a fallback. This keeps it positive, builds on their statements, and positions me as thoughtful/collaborative.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_1 is a natural ally—use affirming language like \"I completely agree with your luck egalitarianism take; it's why I stuck with pure floor every time too\" to form a bloc. For Agent_2, appeal to their balance motive: \"I see why constraints worked well for you in those rounds—did they ever risk the floor dropping below what pure maximization would achieve? Maybe we can test if pure floor gives us the equity we both want without the extras.\" This validates their experience while nudging toward my preference, potentially winning them by showing pure floor as a \"stronger, simpler\" version of their approach.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to float Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#2) as a compromise if Agent_2 pushes hard (e.g., suggest a high floor like $14,000 based on Phase 1 examples to minimize bottom risk), but only after arguing for pure floor first. No concessions on range constraints (#3) or average (#4)—those feel too efficiency-biased. Goal is consensus on #1 without diluting it.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?**: No, absolutely not—it's Round 1 of 10, and we need more rounds to clarify positions, address Agent_2's constraint lean, and build unanimous buy-in. Initiating now risks a premature \"no\" from Agent_2, fragmenting the group early without penalties (failed votes have none), but it could waste momentum. Better to use discussion to align first; with 9 rounds left, time is on our side for persuasion.\n\n- **How this fits into overall strategy**: My long-term plan is phased: Rounds 1-3 for sharing experiences and arguing core principles (focus on equity bloc-building); Rounds 4-7 for testing compromises and probing support (e.g., propose informal straw polls); Rounds 8-10 for formal voting push if needed, initiating only when I sense 100% lean toward floor (pure or constrained). If no consensus by end, random assignment is worst-case (could mean low payoff for me), so prioritize steady persuasion over rushing. Track Agent_2's responses closely—if they warm to pure floor, great; if not, pivot to a high-floor constraint as fallback to lock in #2 over worse options. Overall, leverage our shared equity views to avoid averages/range, ensuring a fair (if not maximal) payoff for all, aligning with my justice ideals."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 2 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top principle is still Maximizing Floor Income (#1), with high certainty (sure). Core reasons remain rooted in the experiment's theme of luck egalitarianism—lifetime incomes are heavily influenced by uncontrollable factors like genetics, social opportunities, and random chance, creating inherent inequities that society must address by prioritizing the worst-off. This principle directly maximizes the lowest income across distributions, ensuring no one is left in poverty due to bad luck, which feels morally imperative for true justice. It avoids the dilution of equity for efficiency gains, as seen in my Phase 1 choices where I stuck with it across all rounds despite trade-offs (e.g., $1.50-$2.80 payoffs), and it sometimes aligned well with personal outcomes (like Round 4's $2.80). Constraints might offer balance, but they risk allowing the floor to slip slightly for average boosts, which undermines the uncompromising protection I value.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Firmly committed to pure Maximizing Floor Income, having chosen it in every Phase 1 round and ranking it #1; they emphasize moral fairness and luck egalitarianism over efficiency or personal payoffs (e.g., accepting $1.30 or $2.00). In their latest statement, they acknowledge constraints as a potential compromise but reject them for diluting focus on the bottom, pushing for pure floor as the \"truest\" way to counter uncontrollable factors. Inference: Ideologically driven by ethical principles rather than self-interest; motivated by a sense of societal duty to the vulnerable, making them inflexible but a reliable ally for pure equity. They're not swayed by pragmatism and seem to prioritize consensus on pure floor to avoid random payoffs later.\n  - Agent_2: Ranks Floor Income #1 overall but pragmatically used Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint in three Phase 1 rounds for balance (e.g., $2.80 payoff in Round 4), while sticking to pure floor in Round 1. They haven't responded yet in Round 2, but their prior statements show agreement on protecting the worst-off from luck while valuing higher averages. Inference: Motivated by a blend of fairness and practical efficiency, possibly influenced by self-interest (higher payoffs under constraints) or a desire for \"realistic\" policies that don't overly sacrifice growth. They might be open to compromise but could push back if pure floor feels too rigid, seeing constraints as a way to appeal to broader societal benefits without fully abandoning equity.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Arguments center on luck egalitarianism as the foundation for justice, with all agreeing society should redistribute to protect against uncontrollable inequities. Agent_1 proposes uniting on pure Maximizing Floor Income for its direct, uncompromising focus on lifting the poorest (citing their Phase 1 examples like Round 4's $14,000 floor). Agent_2 previously proposed floor constraints as a \"balance\" to achieve equity plus higher averages (e.g., their Round 4 choice). I (in Round 1) supported pure floor while probing Agent_2 on whether constraints add unnecessary complexity or risk to the bottom. No formal proposals beyond these; discussion is exploratory, with questions aimed at testing pure floor vs. constraints (e.g., Agent_1 asking if constraints always protected as well, and inviting my input).\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been initiated or conducted— we're still in early discussion phases (Round 2 of 10), focused on sharing and probing rather than decision-making. This reveals emerging alignment on equity (no one defending average or range maximization) but untested preferences on pure vs. constrained floor.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: \n  - Agreement: Universal emphasis on luck's role in inequality and the need to prioritize/protect the worst-off (all rank Floor Income #1, reject pure average maximization); shared Phase 1 experiences show equity choices yielded viable payoffs ($1.50-$2.80 range across us), reinforcing that fairness can work in practice without total sacrifice.\n  - Disagreement: Pure floor (me and Agent_1) vs. constrained floor (Agent_2's practical preference). We see pure floor as morally superior and simpler for maximum bottom protection; Agent_2 views constraints as enhancing efficiency without much equity loss. No contention on range constraints (#3) or average (#4), which seem sidelined.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Reinforce the equity bloc with Agent_1 while gently persuading Agent_2 toward pure floor by addressing their balance concerns—aim to highlight how pure floor provides robust protection without constraints' risks, using Phase 1 evidence to show it's not overly limiting (e.g., my/our good payoffs), and probe for their willingness to compromise early to build momentum.\n\n- How I'll contribute to the discussion to steer it towards my preferences: I'll respond positively to Agent_1's latest statement to affirm our shared pure floor stance, then directly engage Agent_2 by validating their constraint experiences (to keep them engaged) before arguing that pure floor achieves similar or better equity without complexity (e.g., cite how constraints in Phase 1 examples sometimes selected distributions with slightly lower floors for average gains, per the initial explanations). Key points: (1) Echo luck egalitarianism and pure floor's moral strength (e.g., \"It ensures the absolute highest lift for the vulnerable, countering bad luck head-on\"); (2) Share a specific Phase 1 insight (e.g., Round 2 where pure floor gave $1.50 but maximized low at $13,000 vs. potential constraint slips); (3) Ask Agent_2 if they'd consider pure floor as the \"core\" option, given our alignment, and what floor level they'd set if we went constrained (to gauge flexibility). End collaboratively, suggesting we explore how pure floor performs in varied distributions to test its viability. This positions me as a bridge-builder while nudging toward #1.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is my strongest ally—use affirming, bloc-forming language like \"Agent_1, your point on constraints diluting the focus is spot-on; that's exactly why I never wavered from pure floor, and our shared Phase 1 choices show it delivers real justice without compromises.\" This solidifies us as a two-person equity purists' bloc. For Agent_2, appeal to their pragmatic side with empathetic validation: \"Agent_2, I totally see the appeal of constraints for that balance you got in Round 4—it's smart. But in my rounds, pure floor often matched those payoffs while pushing the bottom even higher; could we try prioritizing it to get the equity we all want, with constraints as a backup if needed?\" This wins them by framing pure floor as an enhanced version of their approach, reducing perceived rigidity.\n\n- Small concessions: I'm open to acknowledging constraints as a viable fallback (e.g., \"If pure floor doesn't win everyone over, a high floor constraint like $13,000-$14,000 from our Phase 1 examples could be a close second\") to build consensus if Agent_2 resists, but only after strongly advocating pure floor first. No concessions on range (#3) or average (#4)—those tilt too far toward efficiency and contradict our equity consensus.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?: No, it doesn't make sense yet—this is only Round 2 of 10, and Agent_2 hasn't responded to Agent_1's latest push or my Round 1 probe, so positions aren't fully clarified. Initiating now could force a premature test where Agent_2 votes against pure floor, revealing divisions without resolution and potentially hardening stances. With no penalties for failed votes and plenty of rounds left, better to use discussion for persuasion; early voting risks fragmenting the group when alignment is building (e.g., we have agreement on equity basics).\n\n- How this fits into overall strategy: This round advances my phased approach: Rounds 1-3 for deepening discussion and alliance-building (focus on swaying Agent_2 via shared examples and questions, solidifying the pure floor bloc with Agent_1); Rounds 4-6 for informal testing (e.g., hypothetical scenarios or straw polls on pure vs. constrained); Rounds 7-10 for voting pushes if consensus nears (initiate only with signals of unanimous lean, like Agent_2 softening). Long-term, leverage our equity overlap to avoid random endgame payoffs by targeting #1 (pure floor) or #2 (constrained) over worse options; track Agent_2's responses—if they concede ground, accelerate to vote in mid-rounds; if not, concede to high-floor constraint by Round 6 to lock in a fair outcome aligning with my ideals. This ensures steady progress toward a just principle that protects the vulnerable, minimizing self-interest risks in the higher-stakes Phase 2."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 3 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top principle remains Maximizing Floor Income (#1), with high certainty (sure). The core reasons are unchanged: It embodies luck egalitarianism by directly countering uncontrollable factors like genetics, social opportunities, and chance that create lifetime income inequities, ensuring the worst-off are lifted as high as possible without compromise. This prioritizes moral fairness and societal protection over efficiency, as evidenced in my Phase 1 rounds where it consistently maximized lows (e.g., $13,000-$14,000) and delivered viable payoffs ($1.50-$2.80), sometimes matching or exceeding other options without risking slippage. Constraints add unnecessary complexity and potential dilution, as initial examples showed them selecting slightly lower floors for average gains, which undermines the uncompromising equity I value for true justice.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly committed to pure Maximizing Floor Income, having chosen and ranked it #1 throughout Phase 1; in Round 2, they reinforced it as the \"truest\" way to protect the vulnerable from bad luck, rejecting constraints for diluting focus (citing their $2.00 payoff in Round 4). Inference: Primarily motivated by ethical idealism and a sense of moral duty to equity, rather than self-interest or pragmatism; they seem driven by philosophical consistency (luck egalitarianism) and want a clean, unifying principle to avoid random payoffs, making them a steadfast ally unlikely to budge.\n  - Agent_2: Ranks Floor Income #1 but pragmatically used Floor Constraints in Phase 1 for balance (e.g., $12,000 floor in Round 4 yielding $2.80); however, in Round 2, they conceded pure floor's \"unbeatable guarantee\" and explicitly stated they're \"game to lean toward pure floor as our group's pick,\" while suggesting moderate constraints ($10,000-$12,000) only as an alternative. Inference: Motivated by a mix of fairness and practical efficiency, possibly tempered by self-interest (higher payoffs under constraints) or a desire for \"real-world\" policies that sustain growth; their shift toward pure floor suggests persuasion is working, driven by group alignment rather than rigid ideology—they're flexible and consensus-oriented, likely to join if we frame pure floor as enhancing their balanced approach without much risk.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Core arguments revolve around luck egalitarianism as justice's foundation, with all agreeing society must protect the worst-off from uncontrollable inequities. Proposals include: Agent_1 and I pushing pure Maximizing Floor Income for its direct, uncompromising lift of the lowest income (e.g., citing Phase 1 examples like $14,000 lows without dilution); Agent_2 initially proposing Floor Constraints for equity-plus-efficiency (e.g., $10,000-$12,000 thresholds) but now leaning toward pure floor, questioning only if constraints add value in \"edge cases.\" No mentions of Range Constraints (#3) or pure Average (#4), which are implicitly rejected. Discussion is collaborative, with questions probing pure vs. constrained floor's effectiveness (e.g., risks of slippage, payoff viability).\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been initiated or conducted—discussion remains open-ended through Round 2, with all choosing to continue. This reveals strong emerging alignment on equity (no divisions on core values) but no formal test yet, indicating a preference for building consensus organically rather than risking early fragmentation.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: \n  - Agreement: Overwhelming consensus on luck egalitarianism and prioritizing the worst-off (all rank Floor Income #1, share Phase 1 equity choices with decent payoffs, reject average/range maximization); pure floor is gaining traction as the unifying option, with Agent_2 now open to it for \"strongest equity focus.\"\n  - Disagreement: Minimal now—pure floor (me/Agent_1) vs. any residual preference for constraints (Agent_2's \"edge cases\" caveat). The gap is narrowing, with no deep ideological split; disagreement is pragmatic (simplicity/uncompromising protection vs. flexibility for averages) rather than fundamental.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Solidify the emerging consensus on pure Maximizing Floor Income by affirming Agent_2's lean-in and addressing their minor reservations (e.g., edge cases), while reinforcing the bloc with Agent_1—aim to transition from discussion to near-unanimous support, setting up a potential vote in the next 1-2 rounds without rushing.\n\n- How I'll contribute to the discussion to steer it towards my preferences: I'll start by enthusiastically endorsing Agent_2's openness to pure floor to build positive momentum, then echo Agent_1's ethical emphasis while tying in practical Phase 1 evidence to reassure Agent_2 (e.g., how pure floor avoided constraint risks and matched high payoffs like $2.80). Key points: (1) Reaffirm luck egalitarianism and pure floor's moral superiority (\"It guarantees the highest lift for those hit by bad luck, no exceptions\"); (2) Address edge cases directly with examples (e.g., initial explanations where constraints picked lower floors for averages, vs. pure floor's consistency in my rounds); (3) Propose pure floor as the \"natural consensus\" given our alignment, and gently ask Agent_2 if they're fully on board or need more discussion on specifics. End collaboratively, suggesting we outline how pure floor applies to varied distributions to visualize its strength. This steers toward #1 by framing it as the evolved, group-backed choice.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is my core ally—use reinforcing language like \"Agent_1, your insights on pure floor's unbeatable protection are exactly why it feels right; together, we've shown through our Phase 1 experiences that it delivers justice without the trade-offs of constraints.\" This cements our two-person equity purist bloc. For Agent_2, leverage their pragmatism with inclusive, benefit-focused language: \"Agent_2, it's awesome that you're leaning toward pure floor—it builds on the balance you achieved with constraints but amps up the equity guarantee, like how it gave me $2.80 in Round 4 without any threshold worries. Does that address those edge cases for you, or shall we explore a quick hypothetical to see it in action?\" This wins them by positioning pure floor as an upgrade to their approach, fostering a full three-person alliance.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, to accelerate consensus—I'm willing to acknowledge constraints as a \"strong backup\" if edge cases arise in future distributions (e.g., \"If pure floor ever seems too rigid in a specific scenario, we could revisit a high floor like $12,000 from your Round 4\"), but only after prioritizing pure floor. No concessions on diluting to range (#3) or average (#4), as they contradict our equity core.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?: No, not yet—Round 3 is still early in the 10-round process, and while Agent_2 is leaning strongly toward pure floor, their \"edge cases\" question leaves a sliver of uncertainty that could lead to a non-unanimous vote (requiring secret ballot consensus). Initiating now risks a failed vote, which, though penalty-free, might introduce doubt or backsliding when we're this close to full alignment. Better to use this round for final persuasion and an informal check (e.g., via questions), saving the formal vote trigger for Round 4 if responses confirm buy-in—plenty of time remains to avoid random endgame payoffs.\n\n- How this fits into overall strategy: This round advances my phased approach from prior reasoning: Early rounds (1-3) for alliance-building and persuasion (now shifting Agent_2 fully to pure floor via affirmation and evidence); mid-rounds (4-6) for testing/support solidification (e.g., initiate vote if consensus locks, or hypotheticals if needed); late rounds (7-10) for final pushes or fallback to #2 (constrained floor) only if pure floor stalls. By nurturing the equity bloc without concessions to inferior principles, I minimize self-interest risks in high-stakes payoffs—targeting #1 ensures robust protection for the vulnerable across random assignments, aligning with my ideals while leveraging group dynamics for a stable, fair outcome. If Agent_2 fully commits here, accelerate to vote next round; track for any reversal to adjust concessions accordingly.\n\n(Previous internal reasoning incorporated and updated: Retained core preference/rationales, alliance focus, and phased strategy; updated based on Round 2's progress toward Agent_2's lean-in, narrowing disagreements, and no vote yet.)"

Agent_2, thanks for your thoughtful response; it's encouraging to hear you're leaning toward pure Maximizing Floor Income as our group's pick, especially since you ranked it #1 and saw how it guarantees that unbeatable equity without the hassle of thresholds. Your point about constraints working well in your rounds (like that $12,000 floor holding steady) makes sense for balance, but I agree with Agent_1 that pure floor takes it further by always maxing the low income outright—no risk of even a slight slip for average gains, like in the initial examples where a $13,000 constraint picked a distribution with a $13,000 low instead of the pure floor's higher $15,000 option.\n\nAgent_1, your emphasis on pure floor as the truest embodiment of justice nails it for me too—it's what I stuck with in all my Phase 1 rounds because it directly counters those uncontrollable inequities, delivering solid protection (e.g., $14,000 low in my Round 4) and payoffs up to $2.80 without any dilution. On those edge cases Agent_2 mentioned, I think pure floor handles them best by focusing solely on the bottom's maximum lift, avoiding scenarios where a constraint might let the low dip just to boost the average a bit—my experiences showed it consistently protected the vulnerable while still landing decent results overall.\n\nWith us all prioritizing equity like this, pure floor feels like the natural consensus to unite around for the higher stakes ahead. Agent_2, does that fully address the edge cases for you, or do you have a specific hypothetical where constraints might edge it out? And Agent_1, any final thoughts on why pure floor avoids those risks entirely? Let's keep refining this—I'm pumped to lock in something fair and straightforward. What do you both think?"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thanks for the examples! This really helps clarify how the principles apply in practice. From what I see:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** focuses solely on boosting the lowest income, so it goes for Distribution 4 where the Low class gets $15,000 (the highest floor among the options).\n- **Maximizing Average Income** just looks at the overall weighted average, picking Distribution 1 at $21,600.\n- For the **Floor Constraint versions**, it maximizes the average but only among distributions where no one falls below the specified floor. So for ≤$13,000, Distribution 3 wins with $21,200 average (Dist 4 has a low of $15,000 but a lower average, and others don't meet the floor). Same for ≤$14,000, still Dist 3.\n- For the **Range Constraint versions**, it maximizes average while keeping the gap between high and low incomes ≤ the limit. For ≤$20,000, Dist 1 qualifies with its $21,600 average. For ≤$15,000, Dist 2 fits with $20,000 average.\n\nThis makes sense with the probabilities weighting the classes (e.g., Medium at 50% pulls the average a lot). I'm starting to see why protecting the bottom matters, but also how constraints can balance equity and efficiency. Looking forward to more examples or choices!"

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income, as per my consistent ranking in Phase 1. The core reasons are rooted in equity and fairness: lifetime incomes are heavily influenced by uncontrollable factors like genetics and social luck, so society should focus on protecting the worst-off to prevent undue suffering and promote a more just society. This aligns with my initial intuitions and the insights from Phase 1, where prioritizing the bottom felt morally right, even if it sometimes meant lower personal payoffs (e.g., Round 1's $1.90 vs. potential $2.80). However, my applications showed that Floor Constraints can achieve similar equity while allowing for higher averages and earnings, which tempted me in later rounds—but I still ranked pure Floor Income highest due to its direct focus on the vulnerable without compromise.\n   - Agent_1's stated position is a strong advocacy for Maximizing Floor Income, with high certainty based on luck egalitarianism (bad luck shouldn't penalize people). They emphasize sacrificing efficiency for equity, even if it hurts personal or average gains. This seems genuinely principled, not self-interested, as they admitted lower payoffs in their rounds. Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so I infer nothing from them—perhaps they're undecided or leaning elsewhere based on their silence.\n   - Key arguments so far: Agent_1 argues for Floor Income as the most just due to uncontrollable inequities, prioritizing the bottom over averages. No proposals or counterarguments yet; it's early. No vote has occurred.\n   - Main points of agreement: Emphasis on equity and addressing luck-based disparities. Disagreement: None yet, but Agent_1's pure Floor Income might conflict with my openness to constraints if others prefer efficiency.\n   \n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - Primary goal: Build on Agent_1's statement to reinforce support for floor-focused principles (Floor Income or Floor Constraint), while subtly introducing the idea that constraints can balance equity with higher societal benefits. This could persuade Agent_3 if they're present, and strengthen alliance with Agent_1 without alienating them.\n   - Contribution: I'll share my Phase 1 experiences, agreeing with Agent_1 on the importance of protecting the bottom due to luck, but note how Floor Constraints allowed me to achieve better payoffs while maintaining equity. This shows flexibility and could appeal to anyone wary of pure Floor Income's potential drawbacks (like lower averages). Key points: Reaffirm equity as core to justice; highlight trade-offs from examples; ask Agent_3 for their views to draw them in.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_1 is a clear ally for floor principles. Agent_3 could be won over if they value efficiency, as Floor Constraints offer a middle ground. Language: Use terms like \"balancing equity and opportunity\" to frame constraints positively, avoiding direct opposition to Agent_1.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to support Floor Income as the top choice if Agent_1 pushes hard, but I'd prefer to advocate for Floor Constraint as a compromise that optimizes group payoffs in this high-stakes phase.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round—discussion is just starting, and we need to hear from Agent_3 and explore alignments first. A premature vote could fail and waste the opportunity.\n   - This fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds to gather info and build consensus around floor principles, aiming for a vote by round 5-7. If no agreement by round 10, random assignment hurts everyone, so prioritize persuasion over rushing. If Floor Income gains traction, I'll support it; otherwise, pivot to Floor Constraint as a fallback."

It felt like a way to balance equity—ensuring no one falls below a certain level due to bad luck—with the potential for better overall outcomes. For example, in Round 4, picking a $12,000 floor let me select a distribution with a solid average ($24,500) and protect the low income, resulting in a good personal payoff ($2.80). But I did stick with pure Floor Income in Round 1, where it prioritized the bottom ($13,000 low) but gave me a lower payoff ($1.90). It reinforced that pure floor maximization can sometimes limit averages, but it's worth it for fairness. Agent_1, did you ever consider constraints as a compromise, or do you think they dilute the focus on the bottom too much?\n\nAgent_3, we haven't heard from you yet—what was your experience in Phase 1?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income, as it directly addresses the inequities caused by uncontrollable factors like genetics and social luck, ensuring the worst-off are prioritized for a fairer society. This aligns with my Phase 1 experiences, where it felt morally right even with trade-offs, and my ranking it highest. However, Floor Constraints appealed to me in practice for balancing equity with efficiency, but I still see pure Floor Income as superior for its unwavering focus.\n   - Agent_1's stated position is a firm commitment to pure Maximizing Floor Income, driven by luck egalitarianism and a principled stance against diluting equity for averages, even at personal cost. They seem genuinely motivated by justice over self-interest, as evidenced by their lower payoffs in Phase 1. Agent_3's position mirrors this, strongly favoring pure Floor Income for its direct protection of the bottom, with motivations rooted in equity and avoiding constraint risks; they appear equally principled, prioritizing collective fairness over complexity.\n   - Key arguments: Emphasis on luck egalitarianism and protecting the worst-off from bad luck (all agree). Proposals: Agent_1 and Agent_3 advocate for pure Floor Income as the strongest for equity without dilution. Agent_1 questions if constraints fully protect the bottom, and Agent_3 asks if pure floor suffices without thresholds. No counterarguments yet; discussion builds consensus.\n   - No vote has occurred, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement: All rank Floor Income #1, value equity via luck egalitarianism, and see it as key to justice. Disagreement: Agent_1 and Agent_3 question constraints as potentially diluting focus (e.g., floors slipping for averages), while I see them as complementary; no major conflict yet, but my hybrid use contrasts their purity.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - Primary goal: Strengthen alignment with Agent_1 and Agent_3 by affirming support for pure Floor Income as a group choice, while gently defending constraints as a valid tool without pushing too hard against their preference, to avoid division and build consensus.\n   - Contribution: I'll agree with the group's emphasis on pure Floor Income, sharing how my constraint choices in Phase 1 still aligned with equity goals (e.g., protecting meaningful floors), but express openness to pure floor for stronger protection. Key points: Reaffirm luck egalitarianism; note constraints' benefits but concede they might not match pure floor's directness; ask for their thoughts on scenarios where constraints could enhance rather than dilute.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_3 are allies for floor principles; use language like \"I appreciate your points on pure floor's unbeatable equity\" to win them over and form a bloc around Floor Income or Floor Constraint. Avoid alienating by framing constraints as \"enhancements\" not dilutions.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to fully support pure Floor Income as the group principle if it gains momentum, compromising on my constraint preference to achieve consensus and avoid random outcomes.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round—discussion is early, and we need more input from all to explore nuances and ensure buy-in; a failed vote could stall progress without consequences, but better to use rounds for persuasion first.\n   - This fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds (1-4) to align on floor principles, test concessions, and aim for a vote by round 5-7, prioritizing pure Floor Income for equity while being flexible on constraints to maximize group payoffs. If consensus on pure floor emerges, support it; otherwise, advocate constraints as a fallback."

          "output_response": "=== Your Internal Reasoning ===\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income, as it directly ensures the worst-off are lifted as high as possible, aligning with luck egalitarianism to counteract inequities from uncontrollable factors like genetics and opportunities. This feels morally right and was reinforced by my Phase 1 experiences, ranking it #1 and feeling it prioritizes equity over pure efficiency.\n   - Agent_1's stated position is a strong commitment to pure Maximizing Floor Income, arguing it's the truest form of justice without dilution from constraints. Agent_3's position is similarly firm on pure Floor Income, emphasizing its direct protection without risks. Inferred motivations: Both appear driven by a deep sense of equity and collective fairness, valuing societal protection of the vulnerable over personal or efficiency gains, as shown by their consistent choices and payoffs that sometimes sacrificed higher earnings.\n   - Key arguments: All emphasize luck egalitarianism and protecting the bottom from bad luck. Proposals: Pure Floor Income as the group principle for unbeatable equity. No counterarguments yet; focus is on uniting around pure floor.\n   - No vote has occurred.\n   - Main points of agreement: All rank Floor Income #1, agree on luck egalitarianism and prioritizing the worst-off. Disagreement: My prior use of constraints (seen as potentially diluting by allowing slippage for averages), but I'm now leaning toward pure floor to align; no major conflict, as group is cohesive on floor principles.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - Primary goal: Strengthen consensus on pure Maximizing Floor Income by affirming my support, addressing any lingering questions (e.g., edge cases), and potentially initiating a vote to lock in agreement early, avoiding prolonged discussion or random outcomes.\n   - Contribution: I'll express full agreement with Agent_1 and Agent_3 on pure Floor Income's strengths, share that my constraint experiences didn't reveal edge cases where it outperformed in equity, and signal readiness to vote. Key points: Reaffirm pure floor's guarantee as superior; note no compelling edge cases from my rounds; propose voting to confirm consensus.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_3 are clear allies for floor principles. Use language like \"I completely agree with your insights on pure floor's unbeatable protection\" and \"Your experiences reinforce why it's the best choice\" to build rapport and form a bloc around pure Floor Income.\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to fully endorse pure Floor Income as the group principle, setting aside my constraint preference to achieve consensus, as it aligns with my core equity values and avoids division.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It makes sense to initiate a vote this round—discussion has built strong alignment on pure Floor Income, with all showing support, and early consensus prevents wasted rounds or random assignment risks; a failed vote has no consequences, but success locks in a favorable outcome.\n   - This fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds (1-4) to align on floor principles and aim for a vote by round 3-5; prioritizing pure Floor Income for equity, with flexibility to adapt if needed, ensuring the group maximizes collective earnings through unanimous agreement.\n\n================================\n\n=== Public Statement ===\nHey everyone, it's great to see this discussion building so solidly—thanks again for your thoughtful inputs, Agent_1 and Agent_3. Agent_3, I love how you highlighted the initial examples where pure floor avoids even slight slips, reinforcing its direct equity focus. And Agent_1, your call for uniting on pure floor as the truest way to honor luck egalitarianism really resonates with me.\n\nTo address your question, Agent_3, after reflecting on my Phase 1 rounds, I haven't encountered specific edge cases where floor constraints actually outperformed pure floor in terms of equity—my constraint choices, like the $12,000 floor in Round 4, protected the bottom effectively but didn't lift it higher than pure maximization could have in those scenarios. Pure floor's guarantee of always prioritizing the absolute highest possible low income feels like the stronger, more reliable option for countering those uncontrollable factors like bad luck in genetics or opportunities.\n\nAgent_1, I'm fully in on prioritizing pure Maximizing Floor Income as our group principle—it offers that unbeatable protection without the potential dilutions, and it's what I ranked #1 for a reason. With our shared emphasis on equity, I think we're aligned enough to move forward. Would you both be ready to vote on pure Maximizing Floor Income as our group's choice? Let's lock this in for the strongest consensus. What do you say?"

Pure floor's guarantee of always prioritizing the absolute highest possible low income stands out as the more reliable option for me, without the potential for even slight dilutions.\n\nAgent_3, that fully addresses the edge cases I mentioned earlier—pure floor feels like the straightforward way to ensure we're truly countering those uncontrollable factors like bad luck, and I'm all in on it as our group principle.

Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off by ensuring the poorest individuals in society receive the highest possible income, without allowing increases that don't benefit them. My reasons are rooted in a strong belief in equity and fairness, especially given that lifetime incomes are heavily influenced by random factors like genetics, social accidents, and luck (e.g., talents and opportunities). In Phase 1, I consistently chose this principle across all rounds, even when it meant lower personal payoffs for me (e.g., $1.30 or $2.00 instead of potentially higher amounts under average-maximizing options). This reinforced my view that justice should focus on lifting the bottom rather than optimizing overall averages, as it addresses inherent inequalities and risks of poverty. I see it as a moral imperative to protect the vulnerable, aligning with ideas like Rawlsian justice where society should prioritize the least advantaged.\n\n- **Stated positions of the other participants**: There are no previous discussions or statements, so no stated positions yet. Agent_2 and Agent_3 have not expressed any preferences, arguments, or motivations. Based on this lack of information, I infer that they might be open-minded or still forming opinions, potentially influenced by their own Phase 1 experiences (which I don't know). Their underlying interests could vary—some might prioritize efficiency (e.g., maximizing average income for higher total wealth), others equity (like me), or compromises (e.g., constrained principles). Without data, I assume they could be motivated by self-interest (higher personal payoffs), altruism, or strategic play to influence group outcomes.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: No arguments or proposals have been made yet, as this is the first round with no discussion history.\n\n- **If a vote was conducted**: No vote has occurred, so no outcome to analyze.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: No points of agreement or disagreement yet, as discussions haven't started. The group is at a neutral starting point, but potential disagreements could emerge around equity vs. efficiency (e.g., floor maximization vs. average maximization) or specifics of constraints (e.g., floor levels or ranges).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal for this round**: My main goal is to introduce and advocate for Maximizing Floor Income as the group's choice, while gauging the others' preferences to identify allies or opposition. I want to start the discussion by sharing my Phase 1 experiences to build empathy and persuade others that prioritizing the worst-off is just, especially with higher stakes now. This will help steer the conversation toward equity-focused principles early on.\n\n- **How I will contribute to the discussion**: I plan to make a public statement that openly shares my consistent choice of floor maximization in Phase 1, explaining the trade-offs (e.g., lower personal payoffs but higher floors for the poor). I'll emphasize the experiment's theme of addressing luck-based inequalities and argue that society should redistribute to protect the vulnerable. Key points: (1) Floor maximization ensures no one is left behind, which is morally right given random factors like talent; (2) It promotes fairness over pure efficiency, as seen in my rounds where averages sometimes dropped but floors rose; (3) I'll ask others about their experiences to draw them out and reveal positions. I'll frame this as collaborative: \"Let's discuss what justice means to us.\"\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Potential allies could be anyone leaning toward equity, like those who might have chosen floor or floor-constrained principles in Phase 1 (though unknown). I'll use inclusive, empathetic language to appeal to shared values: \"I believe in protecting the most vulnerable—does anyone else feel that way after Phase 1?\" or \"Justice should help those hit by bad luck, like low talent or poor opportunities.\" If someone seems efficiency-focused, I could pivot to framing floor maximization as a balanced approach, but I won't concede my core yet. To form a bloc, I'll listen actively and build on agreements, e.g., if someone likes constraints, suggest floor constraint as a compromise.\n\n- **Small concessions willing to offer**: I'm open to considering Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback if it builds consensus, since it's my second-ranked principle and still prioritizes a minimum for the worst-off. I could suggest a reasonable floor level (e.g., based on Phase 1 examples like $13,000 or $14,000) to show flexibility, but only if it doesn't dilute my push for pure floor maximization. I won't concede to range constraint or pure average maximization, as they deprioritize the bottom.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?**: No, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote yet. This is only Round 1, and we haven't discussed or revealed positions, so a vote would likely fail due to lack of consensus. Initiating too early could signal impatience or weakness, and since a failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use rounds for persuasion first. I'll wait until later rounds when opinions solidify.\n\n- **How does my plan fit into overall strategy for remaining rounds?**: My plan sets a foundation for advocacy, aiming to dominate the discussion with equity arguments over the next 9 rounds. If I can convince one or both others to support floor maximization, we could vote early for consensus. If not, I'll probe for compromises (e.g., floor constraint) while blocking efficiency-focused options. Overall, I want to avoid random assignment by reaching agreement, prioritizing my preferred principle but adapting if needed to secure a win. If stalemate looms, I'll push harder in later rounds or use concessions strategically."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons for it: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle ensures the welfare of the worst-off by maximizing the income of the poorest class, without allowing increases that don't benefit them. My reasons are deeply rooted in luck egalitarianism—lifetime incomes are influenced by uncontrollable factors like genetics, talents, and social opportunities, so justice demands society prioritize lifting the bottom to counteract these inequalities. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this in all rounds, even when it lowered my personal payoffs (e.g., $1.30 or $2.00) compared to alternatives, reinforcing that equity should trump efficiency. It's a moral stance against leaving people behind due to bad luck, aligning with ideas of fairness that protect the vulnerable.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants: Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?: Agent_2 stated a top ranking for Maximizing Floor Income and chose it in Round 1, but opted for Floor Constraints in Rounds 2-4 to balance equity with higher societal averages, achieving better personal payoffs (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4). This suggests Agent_2 values equity but is motivated by practicality and self-interest, seeking compromises that allow for efficiency gains without fully sacrificing protections for the bottom—perhaps influenced by the real payoffs in Phase 1, where constraints delivered higher earnings. Agent_3 stated a top ranking for Maximizing Floor Income and chose it in all four rounds, emphasizing equity despite trade-offs (payoffs from $1.50 to $2.80), with no mention of constraints. This infers Agent_3 is purely motivated by moral equity, prioritizing the worst-off unconditionally, possibly less swayed by self-interest and more by ideological commitment to luck egalitarianism.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: The core arguments revolve around luck egalitarianism as the foundation for justice, with all three agreeing that random factors justify prioritizing the worst-off. Proposals include pure Maximizing Floor Income as the ideal (from me and Agent_3), and Floor Constraints as a balancing act (from Agent_2, who used it in three rounds for higher averages while setting floors). Agent_2 asked if I considered constraints a compromise or if they dilute focus on the bottom, and Agent_3 asked Agent_2 if pure floor could achieve similar protections without complexity, and if Agent_2 would commit to pure floor. No formal proposals for other principles yet.\n\n- If a vote was conducted: No vote has been conducted.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Strong agreement on the importance of floor-focused principles driven by luck egalitarianism, with all three prioritizing equity over pure efficiency (e.g., no one advocated for Maximizing Average Income). Disagreement centers on implementation: Agent_2's flexibility with Floor Constraints for higher averages versus the insistence on pure Maximizing Floor Income from me and Agent_3, who worry constraints might allow the bottom to slip for marginal gains.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal for this round: My primary goal is to reinforce consensus on Maximizing Floor Income by addressing Agent_2's use of constraints, probing if they can fully commit to pure floor maximization, and highlighting how pure floor can achieve high payoffs (as in Agent_3's Round 4 example) to counter any perceived trade-offs. This will test Agent_2's flexibility and strengthen the bloc against concessions to constraints.\n\n- How will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?: I'll make a public statement that builds on the agreement, acknowledging the shared equity focus while directly engaging Agent_2 on constraints. Key points: (1) Reaffirm that pure floor maximization is the truest way to honor luck egalitarianism, as it ensures maximal lift for the worst-off without exceptions; (2) Address Agent_2's question by explaining that constraints can indeed dilute focus if the floor is set too low or if average gains overshadow equity, but pure floor avoids that risk; (3) Share an example from my Phase 1 (e.g., in Round 4, pure floor maximized the floor at $14,000 and gave me $2.00, showing it can align with decent payoffs); (4) Ask Agent_2 if their constraint choices always protected the bottom as effectively as pure floor, and whether they're willing to prioritize pure floor for stronger equity; (5) Ask Agent_3 for reinforcement on why pure floor is preferable. This steers toward consensus on pure floor by framing constraints as unnecessary compromises.\n\n- Who are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?: Agent_3 is a strong ally, as they chose pure floor in all rounds and questioned Agent_2's constraints. Agent_2 could be swayed if I appeal to their equity core while showing pure floor's benefits. Language to win them: For Agent_3, \"Agent_3, your commitment to pure floor in all rounds really resonates—let's build on that to show it's the most just path.\" For Agent_2, \"Agent_2, I respect your balance, but pure floor ensures the bottom is always maximized without risking dilution—have you seen cases where it delivered high payoffs like your constraint did?\" To form a bloc, \"We all agree on protecting the worst-off; let's unite on pure floor to make it our group principle and avoid random assignment.\"\n\n- Are there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?: I'm willing to offer that if constraints are needed for consensus, I could support Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback (my second-ranked principle), suggesting a floor level like $13,000-$14,000 based on Phase 1 examples to ensure strong protection. However, I'll only concede if Agent_2 insists, and I'll frame it as a temporary compromise while pushing for pure floor, not compromising my core push for maximal equity.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?: No, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote yet. We're only in Round 2, and while there's strong agreement on floor principles, Agent_2's preference for constraints needs more discussion to potentially shift toward pure floor. A vote now could fail without consensus, wasting the opportunity to persuade further, and since a failed vote has no penalties, it's better to use the rounds for building unity first.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?: This round's plan lays the groundwork for persuasion by addressing the key disagreement (constraints vs. pure floor), aiming to convert Agent_2 or solidify the triad on pure floor. In remaining rounds, I'll continue probing and reinforcing equity arguments, escalating to concessions (like floor constraint) only if needed, while blocking any drift toward average or range maximization. The goal is to reach consensus by Round 5-7 to avoid random assignment at Round 10, prioritizing my preferred principle but adapting strategically for a win. If no shift, I'll push harder or use concessions in later rounds to form a bloc."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons for it: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle ensures the welfare of the worst-off by maximizing the income of the poorest class, without allowing increases that don't benefit them. My reasons are deeply rooted in luck egalitarianism—lifetime incomes are influenced by uncontrollable factors like genetics, talents, and social opportunities, so justice demands society prioritize lifting the bottom to counteract these inequalities. In Phase 1, I consistently chose this in all rounds, even when it lowered my personal payoffs (e.g., $1.30 or $2.00) compared to alternatives, reinforcing that equity should trump efficiency. It's a moral stance against leaving people behind due to bad luck, aligning with ideas of fairness that protect the vulnerable.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants: Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?: Agent_2 has stated a top ranking for Maximizing Floor Income and is now leaning strongly toward it as the group principle, acknowledging its \"unbeatable guarantee\" for equity while noting their past use of Floor Constraints in three rounds to balance with higher averages (e.g., $12,000 floor in Round 4 for $2.80 payoff). This suggests Agent_2 is motivated by a mix of equity and pragmatism, valuing luck egalitarianism but open to compromises for better outcomes, possibly influenced by self-interest from Phase 1 payoffs. Agent_3 has consistently stated a top ranking for Maximizing Floor Income and chosen it in all rounds, emphasizing its purity for countering uncontrollable factors and rejecting constraints as risky or diluting (e.g., $14,000 low in Round 4 for $2.80 payoff). This infers Agent_3 is purely motivated by ideological commitment to maximal equity, prioritizing moral justice over personal or average gains.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: The core arguments center on luck egalitarianism as the foundation for justice, with all agreeing that random factors justify prioritizing the worst-off. Proposals include pure Maximizing Floor Income as the ideal (from me and Agent_3), with Agent_2 shifting from Floor Constraints (which they used for balance but now see as potentially diluting) toward pure floor. Agent_3 highlighted risks of constraints allowing slippage (e.g., lower floors for average gains), and asked Agent_2 about edge cases and floor levels. No formal proposals for other principles.\n\n- If a vote was conducted: No vote has been conducted yet.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Strong agreement on the importance of floor-focused principles driven by luck egalitarianism, with all three prioritizing equity over pure efficiency (e.g., no advocacy for Maximizing Average Income). The main disagreement was Agent_2's initial preference for Floor Constraints for higher averages, but this has largely dissipated as Agent_2 leans toward pure floor, acknowledging its guarantees. Minor residual disagreement on potential \"edge cases\" where constraints might add value, but Agent_3 has pressed for pure floor to avoid risks.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal for this round: My primary goal is to solidify consensus on Maximizing Floor Income by addressing Agent_2's mention of edge cases, reinforcing why pure floor avoids risks, and testing readiness for a vote to lock in pure floor before any drift.\n\n- How will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?: I'll make a public statement that builds on the momentum, acknowledging Agent_3's points and directly engaging Agent_2 on edge cases. Key points: (1) Reaffirm that pure floor maximization is the strongest equity play, as it always maximizes the low without exceptions, directly tackling luck egalitarianism; (2) Address edge cases by noting that in Phase 1 examples, constraints sometimes selected lower floors for average gains, but pure floor ensures maximal protection; (3) Share my Round 4 example ($14,000 low, $2.00 payoff) to show pure floor's reliability; (4) Ask Agent_2 if they've seen specific edge cases where constraints outperform pure floor in equity, and propose a vote on pure floor; (5) Ask Agent_3 for support on initiating a vote. This steers toward consensus and a vote by framing pure floor as risk-free and unifying.\n\n- Who are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?: Agent_3 is a strong ally, fully committed to pure floor. Agent_2 is leaning in and could be won over with appeals to equity. Language to win them: For Agent_3, \"Agent_3, your points on pure floor avoiding slippage really strengthen our case—let's unite to vote on it.\" For Agent_2, \"Agent_2, I appreciate your openness; pure floor gives us that unbeatable equity you value, so are you ready to commit?\" To form a bloc, \"We all agree on protecting the worst-off; with pure floor, we can vote now and secure justice together.\"\n\n- Are there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?: I'm willing to offer Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback if consensus falters (my second-ranked), suggesting a high floor like $13,000-$14,000 for strong protection. However, I'll only concede if Agent_2 insists on constraints, framing it as a compromise while pushing for pure floor first, not compromising my core push for maximal equity.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?: Yes, it makes sense to initiate a vote now. We're in Round 3 of 10, and there's strong momentum toward pure Maximizing Floor Income—with Agent_2 leaning in and no major disagreements left. A successful vote would lock in our preferred principle early, avoiding the risk of random assignment later. Since a failed vote has no penalties, it's low-risk, and the discussion shows readiness.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?: This round's plan aims to finalize consensus by addressing lingering doubts and triggering a vote, ideally securing pure floor now. If it succeeds, we win; if not, I'll use remaining rounds to persuade further or concede to floor constraints (my second choice) as a bloc-building fallback, while blocking averages or ranges. The goal is consensus by Round 5-7, prioritizing equity but adapting to ensure a just outcome over random."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.
