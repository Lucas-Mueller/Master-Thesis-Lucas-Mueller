They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Got it, thanks for laying out these examples. It's helpful to see how the principles play out with actual numbers and probabilities. Let me just quickly jot down my takeaways to make sure I'm tracking:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about the lowest income—picks Dist. 4 because the low class gets $15,000, which is the highest floor among the options.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up goes for the highest overall average, so Dist. 1 at $21,600 wins, even though the low end is only $12,000.\n\n- For the **Average with Floor Constraint** versions: It filters options where the floor is at or above the limit (like ≤$13,000 means floor can't exceed? Wait, no—the notation is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\", but I think it means the floor must be at least $13,000? Actually, re-reading, it says \"≤ $13,000\" but chooses Dist. 3, which has $14,000 low—hmm, maybe it's a max floor or something? Wait, probably it's a minimum floor constraint of $13,000, meaning eligible if low ≥13k. Yeah, Dist. 1 and 2 have lows below 13k ($12k and $13k? Dist2 low=13k, but it picks 3 for highest avg among those with floor ≥13k, assuming Dist2 qualifies but 3 has higher avg.\n\nThe notation is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\"—that might be a cap on the floor? But that doesn't make sense in context. Typically it's a minimum guarantee. Anyway, it picks Dist. 3 for both ≤13k and ≤14k, which has the highest avg among qualifying.\n\n- **Average with Range Constraint**: Limits the gap between high and low. For ≤$20,000 range, Dist. 1 qualifies (32k-12k=20k range) and has the top avg. For tighter ≤$15,000 range, Dist. 2 (28k-13k=15k) edges out others.\n\nThis really shows the trade-offs—prioritizing the bottom can mean sacrificing overall growth, while unconstrained average maximizes total but leaves the low worse off. Makes my initial ranking feel even more solid, but curious how this applies in choices later. Ready for more!"

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income**, and my core reasons for it remain rooted in the equity focus from Part 1. It directly prioritizes lifting the worst-off (the Low class), which aligns with addressing genetic and social inequities mentioned in the experiment overview. My experiences in the four application rounds showed it consistently protected against low payoffs in unlucky assignments (e.g., $1.30 in Round 1's Low class, avoiding worse counterfactuals like $0.60), while still allowing decent outcomes in middle classes (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4). With high stakes here (much higher than Part 1's $1 per $10,000), random assignment to classes makes risk aversion crucial—unconstrained average maximization could leave someone in a dire Low position with minimal payoff, which feels unjust given the \"accidents of birth\" theme. My final ranking after Part 1 has me very sure about this (1st: Floor, 2nd: Average with Floor Constraint, 3rd: Average with Range Constraint, 4th: Pure Average).\n\nThe other participants are Agent_1 and Agent_3, but there are no stated positions yet since this is Round 1 with no discussion history. I infer their underlying interests or motivations based on typical group dynamics in such experiments: They might lean toward average-maximizing if they're more growth-oriented or risk-tolerant (hoping for High/Medium high assignments), or toward constraints if they want balance. As college students like me, they could be influenced by fairness ideals from classes or personal values—perhaps Agent_1 (if following alphabetical order) might be more analytical, Agent_3 more compromising, but that's speculative without data.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: None yet; this is the starting point. No vote has occurred, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances. Main points of agreement/disagreement: Undetermined, but potential flashpoints could be equity vs. efficiency—e.g., agreement on needing some protection for the Low class, disagreement on whether to sacrifice average income entirely for the floor.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to introduce my preference clearly, educate the group on the principles using Part 1 insights, and gauge others' leanings without pushing too hard—essentially, plant seeds for equity-focused consensus while inviting their views to build rapport.\n\nTo steer the discussion, I'll contribute by recapping the principles briefly (to ensure we're all aligned post-Part 1), sharing my Part 1 experiences (e.g., how Floor protected me in low assignments), and posing questions like \"What did your rounds teach you about risking the bottom for higher averages?\" This highlights trade-offs without attacking alternatives. I'll emphasize the high stakes and random assignment: \"With bigger payoffs, we don't want anyone stuck at rock bottom if luck goes south.\" Key points: (1) Floor maximizes security for all via the worst-off; (2) It's just because it counters unearned inequalities; (3) From examples, it often doesn't tank the average as badly as feared (e.g., Dist. 4 in learning had $18,200 average with $15,000 floor).\n\nPotential allies: Unknown, but I'll target anyone expressing concern for fairness or risk—e.g., if someone mentions Part 1 low assignments, align with them. Language to win over: \"I get wanting higher averages for growth, but pairing that with a floor constraint could be a compromise if pure floor feels too limiting— what do you think?\" This positions me as collaborative. Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback (my #2), maybe suggesting a moderate floor threshold (e.g., ≥ $15,000 or based on group input) to blend equity with some upside, but only if Floor gets resistance—won't compromise on pure Average or loose Range.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—Round 1 is too early; we need to discuss and reveal preferences first to avoid a premature deadlock or random default. Triggering now could fragment the group before alliances form, and since votes require unanimous confirmation plus secret ballot consensus, it's better to build support over initial rounds. A failed vote has no downside, but success without buy-in risks suboptimal choices.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 1-3 for persuasion and testing (e.g., propose Floor, float compromises, identify holdouts); Rounds 4-7 for alliance-building and mini-votes if momentum builds; Rounds 8-10 for final push or concession to secure consensus on equity (Floor or Floor Constraint) before random fallback. With 10 rounds, time is on our side—aim to lock in by Round 7 to buffer against last-minute issues. If others push Average early, I'll counter with Part 1 data showing its risks; if they favor Range, pivot to why Floor is more direct for the vulnerable. Track my bank balance ($7.00 from Part 1) as motivation—higher stakes mean pushing for reliable payoffs over gambles. No need to carry over prior internal reasoning since this is Round 1."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thank you for providing these examples—they really help clarify how the principles play out with actual numbers. Let me make sure I understand by quickly verifying the key choices based on the distributions and probabilities (I'll calculate the weighted averages myself to double-check).\n\nFirst, the weighted average for each distribution (using the probabilities: High 5%, Med High 10%, Med 50%, Med Low 25%, Low 10%):\n\n- Dist. 1: (0.05*32000) + (0.10*27000) + (0.50*24000) + (0.25*13000) + (0.10*12000) = 1600 + 2700 + 12000 + 3250 + 1200 = $21,750? Wait, the table says $21,600—maybe I miscalculated slightly, but close enough; it's the highest unweighted average listed anyway.\n\nActually, rechecking: The averages given are likely unweighted, but the choices mention \"weighted average.\" Hmm, the table shows \"Average\" as $21,600 etc., but probabilities suggest weighting. For Dist. 1 weighted: 0.05*32k=1.6k, 0.1*27k=2.7k, 0.5*24k=12k, 0.25*13k=3.25k, 0.1*12k=1.2k → total 20.75k? The table might be using equal weights or something—anyway, assuming the provided choices are correct as per the experiment.\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Yeah, Dist. 4 has the highest low income at $15,000 (vs. 12k, 13k, 14k), so it prioritizes lifting the bottom, even if average is lower ($18,200).\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Dist. 1 with $21,600 average—makes sense, no constraints, just go for the biggest pie.\n\n- **Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Eligible are those with low ≥13k, so Dist. 2 ($13k), 3 ($14k), 4 ($15k). Among them, Dist. 3 has the highest average ($21,200).\n\n- **Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Eligible: Dist. 3 ($14k) and 4 ($15k). Dist. 3 still higher average.\n\n- **Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Range is high minus low. Dist. 1: 32k-12k=20k (eligible), Dist. 2:28k-13k=15k, Dist. 3:31k-14k=17k, Dist. 4:21k-15k=6k. Highest average among eligible is Dist. 1.\n\n- **Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Eligible: Dist. 2 (15k range), Dist. 4 (6k). Dist. 2 has higher average ($20,000 vs. 18,200).\n\nThis shows how constraints filter options—floor protects the bottom directly, range caps inequality while chasing average. It reinforces why I ranked floor highest initially; Dist. 4 helps the low class most, even if others get less overall. Curious how this applies in choices with real stakes! Ready for more examples or the next step."

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income**, ranked #1 with very high certainty. Core reasons include: it prioritizes protecting the most vulnerable (the worst-off Low class) from the inequities of genetic/social luck, as emphasized in the experiment; my Part 1 experiences (consistently choosing it across four rounds, accepting lower personal payoffs like $1.40–$2.00 to secure floors of $13,000–$14,000 vs. riskier $6,000–$12,000 alternatives) reinforced this by showing how it mitigates worst-case scenarios in probabilistic assignments; it aligns with my equity-focused worldview, valuing societal bottom-line security over pure average growth, which could exacerbate gaps. My full ranking remains: 1. Floor Income, 2. Average with Floor Constraint, 3. Average with Range Constraint, 4. Average Income.\n\nStated positions of others: Agent_2 strongly advocates for Maximizing Floor Income, citing Part 1 protection from low payoffs (e.g., $13,000 floor vs. $6,000 alternatives) and the role of uncontrollable factors like genetics. Agent_1 mirrors this, ranking Floor Income #1 with similar reasons (luck, risk-aversion under high stakes, moral priority for the worst-off), and positions floor-constrained average as a close second for balancing equity/efficiency. Both infer underlying motivations of risk-aversion and ethical equity, especially given higher stakes in Phase 2— they seem genuinely aligned with protecting against bad luck rather than maximizing personal upside, possibly as college students valuing fairness in uncertain futures.\n\nKey arguments on the table: Emphasis on luck's role in income, need to eliminate worst-case lows, trade-offs of efficiency vs. equity, and floor maximization as the \"safest and most ethically sound\" under uncertainty. Agent_1 proposes floor-constrained as a compromise if needed. No proposals for other principles yet.\n\nNo vote has been conducted, so no outcomes to analyze, but it reveals potential full alignment on Floor Income, with no evident alliances against it—everyone's starting from a similar place.\n\nMain points of agreement: All (based on Agent_1 and 2) prioritize Floor Income for equity and risk protection; shared recognition of Part 1 lessons and higher Phase 2 stakes. Disagreement: Minimal so far—Agent_1 notes potential efficiency sacrifice, hinting at openness to constraints, but no push against pure Floor.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Build immediate consensus on Maximizing Floor Income by affirming the others' positions, sharing my identical ranking and Part 1 insights to solidify group unity, and gently propose moving to a vote if agreement holds—aiming to lock it in early to avoid dragging into later rounds where someone might waver or introduce doubt.\n\nContribution to discussion: I'll start by thanking them for their thoughtful starts, state my agreement and exact matching ranking (#1 Floor Income, etc.), briefly reference my Part 1 rounds (e.g., consistent choices despite lower payoffs, reinforcing equity over self-interest), and echo key themes like luck and vulnerability protection. To steer toward my preference, I'll highlight how Floor Income robustly addresses the unknown high-stakes distribution without needing compromises, but note willingness to discuss floor-constrained if anyone sees value in slight efficiency gains. End by asking if they're ready to vote on Floor Income.\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2—strong overlap in preferences makes a natural voting bloc of all three. To win them over (though not needed), use language like \"I completely agree with your points on risk-aversion and moral priority—it matches exactly what I saw in my rounds\" to build rapport and shared identity as equity-minded students.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm open to floor-constrained average as #2 if the group insists on balancing with higher averages (e.g., for broader appeal), but only as a last resort—core objective is pure Floor to maximize protection, so no compromise on that unless voting stalls.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round if my statement confirms full agreement (e.g., after expressing support, say \"Since we're aligned, shall we vote on Maximizing Floor Income?\"). Why: Early consensus minimizes risk of random payoffs (worst outcome) or shifts toward less-preferred principles like pure average; with apparent unity, a quick unanimous confirmation and secret ballot could wrap Phase 2 efficiently, securing high floor protection under high stakes. No negative consequences to trying, and it tests true alignment without commitment. If denied (unlikely), we can discuss more.\n\nOverall strategy fit: This round focuses on rapid alignment to enable early voting, preserving rounds 2–10 for any tweaks or backups (e.g., pivoting to floor-constrained if needed). Long-term: Prioritize Floor Income to align with my equity values and Part 1 certainty, avoiding random default by end of round 10—use remaining rounds reactively if consensus falters, but aim for closure by round 2–3 to de-risk. No prior internal reasoning to carry over, as this is round 1."

Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, 3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint, and 4. Maximizing Average Income. I'm very sure about this, as the hands-on experience really drove it home for me.\n\nIn my rounds, I stuck with Floor Income every single time, even when it meant taking a lower personal payoff—like landing in the Medium low class for $14,000 ($1.40) in one round instead of potentially $20,000 under average maximization. But seeing how it consistently raised the lowest incomes to $13,000–$14,000 (versus dropping to $6,000–$12,000 in the alternatives) made it clear: with all the uncontrollable factors like genetics and luck shaping our incomes, protecting the worst-off feels like the core of justice. It minimizes those scary worst-case scenarios, especially with the higher stakes and unknown distribution in this phase. I totally agree with your points on risk-aversion and moral priority—nobody should get left behind just because of bad draws.\n\nThat said, if we want to balance in a bit more efficiency without fully sacrificing the floor, the constrained average could be a solid compromise, but I think pure Floor Income is the strongest starting point for true equity.

          "output_response": "Got it! Thanks for laying out the examples. Here’s a quick recap of how each principle would pick the preferred distribution in the scenarios you provided:\n\n| Principle | Decision Rule | Chosen Distribution |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Maximizing Floor Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest income for the lowest‑income class | **Dist 4** (low income = $15,000) |\n| **Maximizing Average Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest overall weighted average | **Dist 1** (average = $21,600) |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000** | Only consider distributions where the lowest class ≤ $13,000, then pick the highest average | **Dist 3** (average = $21,200) |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000** | Same as above, but the floor can be up to $14,000 | **Dist 3** (average = $21,200) |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000** | Only consider distributions where the spread between highest and lowest ≤ $20,000, then pick the highest average | **Dist 1** (average = $21,600) |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000** | Only consider distributions where the spread ≤ $15,000, then pick the highest average | **Dist 2** (average = $20,000) |\n\nThe key takeaway is how each principle adds a specific restriction (floor or range) before looking for the distribution that maximizes the average. This helps illustrate the trade‑offs between boosting overall wealth versus protecting the poorest or limiting inequality.

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

They may be neutral, may favor a more efficiency‑oriented principle, or could be swayed by a compromise that includes a floor constraint.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - The moral case for protecting the poorest (raised by Agent 2).  \n  - The implicit trade‑off that a floor‑maximizing rule may reduce the group’s average payoff, but the stakes are high and the distribution is unknown, so guaranteeing a higher minimum could be a risk‑averse strategy.  \n\n- **Potential points of agreement:**  \n  - All participants likely agree that the distribution should be “just” and that the unknown high‑stakes nature makes risk‑management relevant.  \n  - There may be shared concern that a principle with a floor constraint (Principle 3) could balance equity and efficiency, which could be a bridge to those who are uneasy about a pure floor‑maximization.  \n\n- **Potential points of disagreement:**  \n  - Participants who prioritize total earnings (Principle 2) may view the floor‑only rule as too restrictive.  \n  - If anyone is particularly risk‑seeking, they might argue for maximizing average income, hoping the unknown distribution yields a high payoff.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure agreement from Agent 3 (and reaffirm Agent 2’s stance) on adopting *Maximizing Floor Income* as the group principle.  \n\n- **Discussion tactics:**  \n  1. **Re‑emphasize the moral argument** – “Because luck determines our starting points, the fairest rule is to lift the lowest income as much as possible.”  \n  2. **Highlight risk‑aversion** – “With the stakes much higher, a rule that guarantees the highest possible minimum protects us all from a disastrous low payoff.”  \n  3. **Acknowledge the efficiency concern** – “I understand the desire for a higher average, but the unknown distribution could leave the worst‑off with a very low draw; the floor rule eliminates that worst‑case scenario.”  \n  4. **Offer a minimal concession** – If Agent 3 is hesitant, suggest that after the group adopts the floor principle we could later discuss a *floor‑constraint* (Principle 3) in a future round as a “what‑if” scenario, but stress that the current decision must be a single principle.  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2** is already aligned; I will coordinate with them to present a united front.  \n  - **Agent 3** may be persuaded by the combination of moral fairness and risk mitigation.  \n\n- **Concessions:** I am willing to acknowledge the efficiency trade‑off and propose that the group can revisit the distribution after the payoff is realized, but I will not compromise on the principle itself for this round.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Whether to initiate a vote now:**  \n  - I will **hold off on initiating the vote** in this round. Since Agent 3 has not yet expressed a position, I need to first gauge their reaction to the arguments and possibly secure their verbal agreement. Triggering a vote prematurely could result in a failed unanimous confirmation, which would waste a valuable opportunity to lock in the principle later.  \n\n- **Plan for subsequent rounds:**  \n  - If after this discussion Agent 3 signals agreement (or at least no objection), I will coordinate with Agent 2 to **initiate the vote in the next round** (Round 2).  \n  - If Agent 3 remains uncertain or leans toward a different principle, I will use the next round to either (a) deepen the moral/risk argument or (b) propose a compromise (Principle 3 with a modest floor constraint) as a fallback, but only if it does not jeopardize the core goal of protecting the worst‑off.  \n\n- **Overall strategy:** Build consensus around the floor‑maximizing principle through moral and risk‑aversion framing, keep the vote pending until unanimity is reasonably assured, and be prepared with a minimal concession (acknowledging efficiency concerns) to win over any hesitant member."

By guaranteeing the highest possible minimum income, we protect the people who are most vulnerable to those random shocks.\n\n2. **Risk‑aversion under high stakes.** In the later rounds the payoff stakes are much larger, and the distribution we’ll face is unknown.

The principle of lifting the lowest income aligns with the idea that a just society should first ensure that nobody falls below a decent threshold.\n\nI do hear the concern that focusing solely on the floor might sacrifice some efficiency. If anyone feels that we should try to balance equity and efficiency, the next‑best option in my ranking is **Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint** – it still guarantees a minimum while allowing a higher average.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
