They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Understood—thanks for laying out these examples. It's helpful to see how the principles play out with actual numbers and those class probabilities. Let me just quickly note what stands out to me to make sure I've got it:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** goes for Dist. 4 because it boosts the lowest earners the most ($15,000 floor vs. $12,000–$14,000 in the others). That aligns with prioritizing the bottom to avoid anyone being left too far behind.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** picks Dist. 1 for the highest overall weighted average ($21,600), even though the floor is lower—it's all about growing the total pie without equity checks.\n\n- For the **Floor Constraint** versions (≤ $13,000 or ≤ $14,000), both select Dist. 3. That makes sense since Dist. 3 has a $14,000 floor (which qualifies under both) and the best weighted average among options that meet the minimum guarantee.\n\n- On the **Range Constraint** side, ≤ $20,000 allows Dist. 1 (range is $32k - $12k = $20k, right on the limit, with top average). But tightening to ≤ $15,000 knocks out Dist. 1 (range $20k) and picks Dist. 2 (range $28k - $13k = $15k, best average of the tighter options).\n\nThis really clarifies the trade-offs—higher averages often mean bigger gaps, but constraints force more balance. I'm feeling more confident about how these would apply in real scenarios. What's next?"

From the four rounds in Phase 1, I saw repeatedly how high-average distributions (like those with $6,000–$8,000 floors) boosted overall numbers but left the low class (10% probability) in dire straits, while floor-maximizing choices provided reliable security for most (e.g., my payoffs around $1.90–$2.00, but protecting against worse outcomes). It aligns with justice as fairness, recognizing life's random \"accidents\" (genetics, social factors) that could put anyone at the bottom. I view the other principles as secondary: Floor Constraint (2nd) adds growth but requires specifying a minimum (risky if too low); Range Constraint (3rd) caps inequality but doesn't directly target deprivation; Average Maximization (4th) ignores equity for efficiency, which felt unjust in simulations.\n  \n- **Stated positions of other participants**: None yet—this is Round 1, and there's no discussion history. I infer from the experiment setup that Agents 1 and 2 likely have their own Phase 1 rankings (possibly more growth-oriented, as college students might prioritize averages for personal gain), but I'll watch for self-interested motivations like risk aversion (favoring floors) vs. optimism (favoring averages). Underlying interests could include maximizing personal expected payoff (higher under averages, given random assignment) or ethical concerns (aligning with floors for equity).\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Nothing yet. I'll introduce mine: Advocate for floor maximization using Phase 1 insights to frame it as protective and prudent, especially with higher stakes here (unknown distributions, but random assignment means anyone could draw low).\n\n- **Vote outcome**: No vote has occurred. This reveals nothing about alliances yet.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Too early for agreements/disagreements. Potential flashpoints: If others push average maximization, disagreement on equity vs. efficiency; agreement might form on needing some constraint to avoid pure randomness (the default if no consensus).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Kick off the discussion by clearly stating my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, sharing concise Phase 1 evidence to educate and persuade, and inviting others' views to identify allies early. Aim to establish equity as a group value without alienating growth-focused members—test the waters for consensus potential.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: Start positively: Acknowledge the higher stakes and shared uncertainty, then explain my principle with examples (e.g., \"In Phase 1, choosing floor max protected against $6k lows that could've hit me, even if my payoff was slightly lower—better safe than sorry for the group\"). Emphasize societal benefits: \"It ensures justice by focusing on the vulnerable, preventing resentment or instability from extreme inequality.\" Propose it as a starting point, ask questions like \"What did your Phase 1 rounds show you?\" to draw out positions. Avoid confrontation; frame as collaborative (e.g., \"We all want growth, but not at the cost of leaving people behind\").\n\n- **Potential allies**: Unknown, but Agent_1 or Agent_2 might align if they had low-class draws in Phase 1 (risk-averse types). To win them over: Use empathetic language like \"Imagine if you landed low—floor max gives us all a safety net\" or appeal to long-term group harmony (\"Equity builds trust, leading to better collective outcomes\"). If someone leans toward constraints, suggest floor max as the purest form, or concede to a high floor constraint as a compromise.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm open to discussing a Floor Constraint version (my #2) with a high minimum (e.g., $12k+ based on Phase 1 floors) if pure floor max lacks support—it still protects the bottom while allowing some average boost. Won't budge on avoiding pure Average Maximization, as it contradicts my ethics and Phase 1 lessons.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate a vote this round?**: No—it's Round 1 of 10, and we need discussion to build understanding and alliances first. Jumping to vote risks polarization without buy-in, and a failed unanimous confirmation would waste momentum. Better to use early rounds for persuasion; save vote initiation for Round 3–5 once positions clarify (I can trigger it once, so strategically when support seems 2/3+).\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Over 10 rounds, my plan is phased: Rounds 1–3: Share experiences, probe views, form loose coalitions around equity (target floor or floor-constrained). Rounds 4–7: Propose compromises, test mini-votes if needed. Rounds 8–10: Push for final consensus or initiate vote to avoid random default. Overall, stick to core preference but be flexible on details to reach agreement—success means group-wide protection, aligning with my justice view. If talks stall, highlight random payoff risk to motivate. Track bank balance ($7.50 from Phase 1) as baseline; aim for equitable high-stakes gains without personal greed."

Sure, it didn't always max out my personal payoff (I ended up around $1.90–$2.00 per round), but it protected the vulnerable group-wide, which feels fairer given how unpredictable life (or class assignments) can be.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 2 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (ranked 1st with very high certainty from Phase 1, unchanged). Core reasons: It directly targets justice by maximizing the lowest income, preventing extreme deprivation (e.g., $6k–$8k lows in high-average distributions from Phase 1) that could hit anyone due to random life factors like genetics or society. Simulations showed it provided reliable protection (my payoffs ~$1.90–$2.00 per round, total $7.50) at modest personal cost versus average max (~$0.40–$1.00 less), but prioritized societal equity over individual gain. It feels intuitively fair under uncertainty, outperforming constraints (which add parameters and indirect protection) or pure averages (which exacerbate inequality). This aligns with viewing income distribution as a collective safety net, not a zero-sum game.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 stated strong preferences for Maximizing Floor Income as #1 in Round 1, with very high certainty, mirroring my own. Agent_1 emphasized luck's role in outcomes and the ethical weight of protecting the vulnerable, citing personal Phase 1 payoffs ($7.10 total) and acceptance of trade-offs for fairness. Agent_2 highlighted similar experiences (including a Low class draw at $1.30, total $6.70) and proposed an early vote to lock it in, stressing alignment and higher stakes. Inferences: All seem motivated by ethical equity and risk aversion—Agent_1's decline of the vote suggests caution or desire for more discussion to ensure buy-in, possibly valuing thorough consensus to avoid regrets under random assignment. Agent_2 appears pragmatic and consensus-driven, pushing for efficiency in decision-making. No self-interested greed evident; instead, shared aversion to exploitation of the bottom, likely from Phase 1 realizations of personal vulnerability (e.g., low draws). Underlying interests: Collective justice over max personal expected value, with a group-oriented motivation to prevent random default at end.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table so far?: Key arguments: All three invoked Phase 1 evidence of floor max's protective role against low floors in growth-heavy options, accepting modest payoff sacrifices for fairness amid uncertainty. Emphasis on life's inequities (genetics/society) making floor prioritization just. Proposals: Agent_2 suggested initiating a vote in Round 1 to confirm Floor Max early (no parameters needed), framing it as leveraging alignment for high-stakes security. No counter-proposals; discussion stayed positive and unified.\n\n- If a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?: Agent_2 initiated a vote on Floor Max; Agent_2 and I (Agent_3) confirmed, but Agent_1 declined, so the vote was declined (no outcome). Reveals: Strong alliance potential—two of three (me and Agent_2) ready to commit immediately, indicating solid support for Floor Max. Agent_1's decline doesn't signal opposition to the principle (they endorsed it strongly) but suggests preference for more deliberation, perhaps to build deeper understanding or test for hidden divergences. No fractured alliances; it highlights Agent_1 as the cautious holdout, but overall group leans heavily toward floor max, with no evident preference for alternatives.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?: Agreement: Unanimous endorsement of Maximizing Floor Income as #1, based on shared Phase 1 insights (protection vs. risk, equity over pure efficiency); recognition of higher Phase 2 stakes and need for consensus to avoid random payoffs. No disagreements on principles—surprisingly harmonious. Minor implicit tension: Pace of decision-making (Agent_2's push for quick vote vs. Agent_1's decline), but this is procedural, not substantive; could stem from wanting to ensure all voices are heard before locking in.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Reinforce the strong alignment on Floor Max while gently probing Agent_1's vote decline to understand and address any reservations, aiming to build momentum toward a future vote without rushing. Test if we can solidify unanimous support and perhaps float a mini-discussion on why pure floor (no constraints) is ideal, steering away from potential compromises early.\n\n- How will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?: Contribute collaboratively and positively: Respond to Agent_2's vote proposal by acknowledging the enthusiasm but supporting Agent_1's caution as smart for such stakes—then pivot to affirming Floor Max with a quick Phase 1 recap (e.g., \"Across my rounds, it consistently avoided those poverty traps, giving us all peace of mind\"). Key points: (1) Highlight group synergy as a strength (\"Our shared Phase 1 paths show floor max isn't just ethical—it's practical for uncertain payoffs\"); (2) Address vote timing (\"Early consensus is great, but a bit more chat ensures we're rock-solid\"); (3) Invite specifics (\"Agent_1, what made you hold off on the vote? Any tweaks to floor max on your mind?\"); (4) Emphasize no need for parameters (\"Pure floor max keeps it simple and directly protective\"). Keep tone engaging and inclusive to maintain harmony, ending with an open question to Agent_1/2 for their updates.\n\n- Who are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are natural allies, given identical preferences—Agent_2 as the proactive one (align with their efficiency push: \"I love your idea of locking it in soon; let's just confirm we're all 100%\"). Agent_1 as the thoughtful one (empathize with caution: \"Totally get wanting to discuss more—your point on luck really hit home for me too; how can we make sure floor max feels right for everyone?\"). To form a bloc: Use \"we\" language (\"We're already aligned on protecting the bottom—together, we can make this our group's strength\") to foster unity, positioning us as a cohesive trio against any external risks (e.g., random default).\n\n- Are there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?: Yes, if Agent_1 raises concerns about growth trade-offs, I'd concede to exploring a Floor Constraint variant (my #2, e.g., max average with a $13k+ floor from Phase 1 examples) as a \"safety net plus\" hybrid—but only as a last resort, framing it as enhancing (not replacing) pure floor max. Won't concede to range or average max, as they dilute direct bottom protection; core objective is floor prioritization.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).: No, not this round—Agent_1's decline shows they're not quite ready, and with 8 rounds left, pushing now risks minor frustration without gain. Better to use Round 2 for clarification to ensure a stronger yes next time (e.g., Round 3). I can trigger once, so save it for when I sense full buy-in (2-3 rounds from now), avoiding any perception of impatience. Failed votes are neutral, but success is key for momentum.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?: This round's focus on probing and affirming fits my phased approach: Rounds 1-3 for sharing/probing to confirm alignment and resolve procedural hesitations (like vote timing), building trust. Rounds 4-7: Deepen arguments with examples/counterfactuals, propose compromises if needed, and initiate vote when unanimous vibes emerge. Rounds 8-10: Finalize or fallback to vote to beat random default. Overall: Leverage early harmony to aim for quick consensus on Floor Max (ideal by Round 4-5), using flexibility on constraints only if stalls occur—maximizes equity while hedging personal/group payoffs under randomness. Track others' responses to adapt; goal is collective protection aligning with Phase 1 lessons ($7.50 baseline), not personal max. Retain prior insights on Phase 1 patterns (floor's reliability vs. avg risks) and Round 1 synergy as foundational."

It's all about lifting the bottom, no matter the average.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Dist. 1 takes it with the highest weighted average (around $21,600 as listed), even though the floor is lower. Straight utilitarianism, I guess—total pie size matters most.\n\n- For the **Floor Constraint** versions: With ≤ $13,000, Dist. 3 qualifies (its low is $14k? Wait, no—Dist. 3 low is $14k, which is over $13k, but the explanation says it chooses Dist. 3. Hmm, maybe I misread—actually, looking back, Dist. 1 low $12k, Dist. 2 $13k, Dist. 3 $14k, Dist. 4 $15k. For ≤ $13k constraint, eligible would be Dist. 1 and 2 (floors $12k and $13k), but it says Dist. 3? That can't be right unless the constraint is a minimum guarantee, not a max. Wait, the principle is \"guaranteeing a specified minimum income,\" so floor constraint means everyone gets at least that amount, so for ≤ $13,000 it probably means minimum of $13k? The wording is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\"—that ≤ is confusing. Typically it's a minimum floor, so distributions where low ≥ $13k would be eligible? But Dist. 2 has $13k, Dist. 3 $14k, Dist. 4 $15k. And it chooses Dist. 3 for both ≤13k and ≤14k, which has higher avg than 2 or 4? Dist. 3 avg $21,200 > Dist. 4's $18,200, yes. But for ≤13k, if it's min floor of 13k, Dist. 3 qualifies. The ≤ might be a max on the constraint value, but anyway, point is it filters for floors at or above that level and picks highest avg among them.\n\n- **Range Constraint**: For ≤ $20,000 range (high-low diff), Dist. 1 range is $32k-$12k=$20k exactly, so eligible and highest avg. For ≤ $15,000, Dist. 1 is $20k range (too big), Dist. 2 is $28k-$13k=$15k, Dist. 3 $31k-$14k=$17k (over), Dist. 4 $21k-$15k=$6k (fine but lower avg), so Dist. 2 wins among eligible.\n\nThis reinforces why I ranked Maximizing Floor first—it's straightforward and protects the vulnerable, like in Dist. 4. But I see the trade-offs; sometimes you get a lower average overall. The constraints add nuance, balancing equity with efficiency. Got any more examples or a quiz to test this out? I'm ready to apply it!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 1 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, ranked #1 with very high certainty (very sure). This is based on my Phase 1 experiences across all four rounds, where it consistently protected against the worst outcomes (e.g., avoiding $6,000 or $8,000 lows in Low class assignments, yielding reliable payoffs like $1.30 in Round 1 and $2.00 in Rounds 3/4). The core reasons are rooted in the experiment's theme of luck-driven inequities—genetic/social factors mean no one deserves extreme poverty, so justice demands prioritizing the highest minimum income for the vulnerable. It aligns with fairness over raw efficiency, even if it meant slightly lower personal gains in mid-tier classes (e.g., $20,000 vs. potential $24,000). My full ranking is unchanged: 1. Floor Income, 2. Average with Floor Constraint (as a practical compromise for some growth), 3. Average with Range Constraint (limits inequality but less targeted), 4. Average Income (risks neglecting the bottom, as seen in counterfactuals).\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: \n  - Agent_3: Strongly prefers Maximizing Floor Income (#1, high certainty), emphasizing protection from random low outcomes (e.g., $6,000/$8,000 risks) and group-wide fairness over personal max payoffs (their Phase 1 earnings ~$1.90–$2.00/round). Inferred motivation: Altruistic equity focus, possibly influenced by personal Low class experiences in Phase 1; they seem risk-averse to bad luck and want to build consensus early for stability.\n  - Agent_1: Also ranks Maximizing Floor Income #1 (very high certainty), highlighting luck's role in outcomes and the moral imperative to safeguard the worst-off, despite forgoing higher personal counterfactuals (their total Phase 1: $7.10). Inferred motivation: Similar to mine and Agent_3's—prioritizes societal justice over individualism; they value vulnerability protection and are collaborative, as seen in responding positively to Agent_3 and inviting my input.\n  - Overall, both seem genuinely aligned with my views, likely from similar Phase 1 simulations reinforcing floor prioritization. No signs of hidden agendas like pushing average max for greed; their language stresses fairness and shared experiences.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_3 opened by sharing their Floor Income preference and Phase 1 insights, inviting others to discuss for common ground/balance of equity/growth. Agent_1 echoed this alignment, shared their earnings/ranking, and directly asked for my input to identify overlaps/differences toward consensus. No specific proposals yet beyond implicit support for Floor Income; the tone is cooperative, focusing on Phase 1 lessons (protection vs. efficiency trade-offs).\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred; this is the first round, so no revelations on alliances yet. However, the discussion history shows strong early harmony.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreement is near-total so far—we all appear to favor Floor Income as #1, valuing its role in mitigating luck-based poverty and drawing from Phase 1's real-stakes lessons (e.g., avoiding dire lows). No explicit disagreements; potential subtle differences could emerge if someone (e.g., me) probes on constraints as alternatives, but nothing indicates conflict. The group seems primed for quick unity on equity-focused principles.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Confirm and solidify the apparent alignment on Maximizing Floor Income, then gently propose initiating a vote to lock in consensus early. With high stakes in Phase 2 (unknown distributions, random assignments), securing this principle ASAP minimizes risks of deadlock or random fallback by Round 10. Avoid over-discussing to prevent introducing doubts.\n\n- **How I'll contribute to steer toward preferences**: I'll start by affirming the others' positions, briefly share my matching Phase 1 summary (e.g., consistent Floor Income choice, total earnings ~$6.70 across rounds, protection in Low/Medium low assignments), and reiterate why it's the just choice (addresses experiment's inequities directly). Then, highlight our shared views as a strong foundation for consensus, and suggest voting on Floor Income this round since it doesn't require constraints. Keep it positive/collaborative to build rapport.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_1 and Agent_3 are clear allies—their statements mirror mine, so I'll reinforce the bloc with inclusive language like \"It's great to see we're all aligned on Floor Income as the fairest way to handle luck's uncertainties—let's capitalize on that unity.\" No need to \"win over\" since they're already there; this phrasing forms a natural voting bloc by emphasizing mutual benefits (e.g., group protection in high-stakes payoffs).\n\n- **Small concessions willing to offer**: If discussion veers (unlikely), I'd concede to exploring Floor Constraints as a close second if they worry about efficiency (e.g., \"If pure Floor feels too rigid, a moderate floor constraint could be our compromise\"), but only as a last resort—my core objective is pure Floor Income for its direct vulnerability focus. No compromise on average max or range, as they contradict my justice views.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?**: Yes, absolutely—our statements show strong alignment on Floor Income, so proposing a vote now tests and confirms unanimity without wasting rounds. A successful early vote secures payoffs under a safe, preferred principle; failure (unlikely) has no penalty and just prompts more discussion. Delaying risks diluting focus or introducing unrelated ideas over 10 rounds, especially with random assignment threats.\n\n- **How this fits overall strategy**: My long-term plan is rapid consensus on Maximizing Floor Income to ensure high-stakes payoffs prioritize the minimum (protecting against potential extreme lows in unknown distributions). If vote passes (expected), we're done early; if not, use subsequent rounds to address any minor hesitations (e.g., via constraints) while blocking efficiency-focused drifts. Prioritize equity bloc over prolonged debate, as Phase 1 taught that floor protection yields reliable (if not maximal) outcomes across assignments. No need to retain prior internal reasoning— this round's analysis builds directly on the aligned discussion history."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 2 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top principle is still Maximizing Floor Income, ranked #1 with very high certainty (very sure). This preference is unchanged from Phase 1 and Round 1, rooted in the experiment's focus on luck-driven inequities from genetic and social factors—justice requires directly protecting the worst-off by maximizing the minimum income, as seen in my Phase 1 rounds where it shielded against severe lows (e.g., $13,000 vs. $6,000 in Round 1) while providing reliable mid-tier outcomes ($14,000–$20,000 across assignments). It prioritizes equity over efficiency, avoiding the moral hazard of pure average maximization that risks poverty for some to boost overall wealth. My full ranking remains: 1. Floor Income, 2. Average with Floor Constraint (balances protection with some growth), 3. Average with Range Constraint (curbs extremes but less focused on the bottom), 4. Average Income (unjustly neglects vulnerability, per counterfactual risks).\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Firmly supports Maximizing Floor Income as #1 (high certainty), emphasizing its safety net against random poverty (e.g., $6,000–$8,000 lows) and sharing their Phase 1 total of ~$7.50, noting trade-offs with higher counterfactuals but prioritizing group fairness. Inferred motivation: Risk-averse and equity-oriented, likely shaped by Phase 1 experiences of low assignments; they seem collaborative and consensus-driven, as evidenced by affirming my vote proposal and probing Agent_1 gently to resolve hesitations without confrontation—aiming for early stability to secure protective payoffs in high-stakes Phase 2.\n  - Agent_1: Also ranks Maximizing Floor Income #1 (very high certainty), stressing luck's role and the ethical need to safeguard the vulnerable, with Phase 1 earnings of $7.10 and acknowledgment of forgone personal gains (up to $3.00). They declined the Round 1 vote but invited my input positively. Inferred motivation: Aligned with equity but perhaps more cautious or deliberative, possibly wanting deeper discussion to ensure buy-in or explore nuances (e.g., constraints) before committing; their tone suggests a motivation for thorough, principled consensus rather than haste, avoiding any regret in random assignments.\n  - Overall, both are genuinely aligned with my views from similar Phase 1 simulations, showing no push toward efficiency or constraints—motivations appear altruistic and fairness-focused, not self-interested (e.g., no greed for average max).\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_3 opened Round 1 with Floor Income advocacy, sharing experiences and inviting Phase 1 recaps for common ground/balance. Agent_1 echoed alignment, shared details, and sought my input for overlaps toward consensus. I affirmed unity, recapped my $6.70 earnings/insights, and proposed voting on Floor Income early. In Round 2, Agent_3 reinforces synergy, supports the vote idea, and asks Agent_1 about their decline to clarify hesitations. Key proposal: Early vote on pure Floor Income (no parameters needed); implicit argument: Leverage alignment for quick, protective consensus amid rising stakes.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): In Round 1, I initiated a vote on (implied) Maximizing Floor Income; Agent_3 confirmed, but Agent_1 declined, resulting in the vote being declined (not passed). This reveals strong support from Agent_3 and me (2/3 bloc), but Agent_1's caution suggests a potential alliance wait-and-see—indicating no opposition to Floor Income itself, just a preference for more dialogue to solidify it, rather than a shift in preferences or hidden rivalries.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Overwhelming agreement on Maximizing Floor Income as the top choice, valuing its protection against luck-based lows (e.g., shared Phase 1 examples of $6,000–$8,000 risks) and equity over efficiency, with all acknowledging trade-offs like lower mid-tier payoffs. No explicit disagreements on principles—our rankings align closely. The only subtle tension is procedural: Agent_1's vote decline implies a desire for more discussion (perhaps to confirm unanimity or address efficiency concerns indirectly), while Agent_3 and I favor moving faster; this isn't a core disagreement but could delay if not addressed.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Address Agent_1's hesitation by seeking clarification on their decline, while reinforcing the group's alignment on Floor Income to build momentum toward a unanimous vote—aiming to convert their caution into confirmation without prolonging debate.\n\n- How I'll contribute to the discussion to steer it towards my preferences: I'll respond supportively to Agent_3's Round 2 statement, thanking them for the positive recap and echoing the synergy on Floor Income (e.g., reference shared Phase 1 protections). Then, directly but gently ask Agent_1 about their decline (e.g., \"Agent_1, curious what gave you pause on the vote—any specific Phase 1 insights or tweaks you'd like to discuss?\"), sharing a quick reaffirmation of my reasons (e.g., how it yielded reliable $6.70 total by avoiding extremes). End by proposing we revisit the vote this round if resolved, emphasizing mutual benefits like early security against random payoffs. Key points: Highlight unanimity's strength, reiterate Floor Income's justice in countering inequities, and frame discussion as brief fine-tuning rather than overhaul.\n\n- Who are my potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?: Agent_3 is a clear ally (already confirmed vote), so I'll bolster our 2/3 bloc with inclusive language like \"Agent_3 and I are right there with you on Floor Income's protective power—it's exciting how our experiences line up.\" For Agent_1, treat them as a near-ally by acknowledging their caution positively: \"Agent_1, your thoughtful approach in Round 1 was spot on for ensuring we're all solid; if it's just about hashing out a bit more, let's do that quickly to lock in what we all seem to agree on.\" This wins them over by validating their style, forming a full bloc through empathy and shared equity focus—no need for persuasion on the principle itself.\n\n- Are there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?: Yes, if Agent_1 raises efficiency concerns (e.g., from Phase 1 counterfactuals), I'd concede to briefly discussing Floor Constraints as a fallback (my #2), like \"If pure Floor feels a tad rigid based on your rounds, a moderate floor constraint could be a close second for some balance— but I still lean toward straight Floor for its direct impact.\" This builds consensus without shifting from equity prioritization, as it keeps Floor Income central and avoids range or average max.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?: Yes, it makes sense if Agent_1's response (via discussion) resolves their hesitation—our strong alignment suggests a high chance of unanimity now, and a successful vote secures Floor Income early, minimizing risks over the 9 remaining rounds (e.g., avoiding random fallback by Round 10). A failed vote has no downside, just prompts more talk; declining again would unnecessarily delay, as Agent_3 and I are ready. I'll initiate only after gauging Agent_1 in my statement, to maximize pass odds—triggering my once-per-round option strategically.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?: This round's focus on clarifying and voting aligns with my long-term goal of rapid consensus on Maximizing Floor Income for protective, high-stakes payoffs—building on Round 1's near-miss to achieve it by Round 2 or 3, then using any extras for implementation details if needed. If vote passes, we're done; if not, pivot to concessions like floor constraints in Rounds 3–5 to maintain equity bloc against drifts, while blocking efficiency pushes. Overall, prioritize swift unity to leverage Phase 1 lessons (reliable floor protection across assignments) and counter random threats, retaining prior reasoning on alignment/trade-offs where relevant (e.g., incorporating Phase 1 earnings insights for rapport)."

It's awesome to see how our Phase 1 paths all led to the same spot: Maximizing Floor Income as the clear #1 for justice. For me, those rounds really drove it home—my $6.70 total came from solid protections like dodging the $6k lows in Round 1, even if it meant passing on some mid-tier upsides in the counterfactuals. Prioritizing that safety net against luck's wild cards just feels right, especially with the experiment's whole point about genetic and social inequities. No need for constraints or ranges when the pure floor hits the equity mark so directly.\n\nAgent_1, I'm with Agent_3 on being curious about what gave you pause on the vote last round—your thoughtful input in Round 1 was super valuable for making sure we're all aligned, so if there were any Phase 1 takeaways or tweaks (like efficiency trade-offs) on your mind, I'd love to hear them.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income. The core reasons for this are rooted in equity and fairness: lifetime income is heavily influenced by luck (genetic and social accidents), so justice requires prioritizing the worst-off to ensure no one falls into extreme poverty or hardship. This principle guarantees the highest possible minimum income, preventing exploitation of the vulnerable, even if it means accepting lower overall averages or personal trade-offs. My Phase 1 experiences reinforced this—counterfactuals showed I could have earned up to $3.00 in Round 1 or $2.40 in Round 4 by choosing other principles, but I consistently chose Floor Income, resulting in $7.10 total earnings. These trade-offs were acceptable because they promoted societal fairness over individual gain.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_3 has clearly stated a preference for Maximizing Floor Income as their top principle, ranking it #1 with high certainty. They described sticking with it in Phase 1 despite personal payoffs of $1.90–$2.00 per round, emphasizing protection of the vulnerable and balancing equity with growth. Agent_2 has not spoken yet, so I have no information on their position.\n\nBased on their arguments, I infer Agent_3's underlying interests are similar to mine: a strong focus on equity and protecting the least fortunate, motivated by a sense of moral justice rather than pure self-interest. They seem open to discussion and finding common ground, possibly willing to compromise on related principles like floor constraints if it builds consensus. For Agent_2, I have no inferences yet, but their silence suggests they might be observing or have a different preference that could introduce disagreement.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_3 proposed starting with sharing Phase 1 experiences and preferences to find common ground, specifically advocating for Maximizing Floor Income while noting it balances equity and growth. No other proposals yet.\n\nNo vote has been conducted, so no outcomes to analyze.\n\nMain points of agreement: Potential alignment with Agent_3 on Maximizing Floor Income as a top choice, both valuing equity over pure efficiency. Points of disagreement: Unknown for Agent_2; possible tension if others prefer average maximization for higher personal stakes, given the higher Phase 2 payoffs.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to introduce my own position clearly, share my Phase 1 experiences to build rapport and demonstrate consistency, and probe Agent_2's views to assess the group's leanings early. This will help identify allies and potential blocs without rushing to a vote.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by greeting the group and acknowledging Agent_3's statement to show engagement. Then, I'll briefly summarize my Phase 1 journey, emphasizing how Maximizing Floor Income led to personal trade-offs but felt just for society. I'll explain my reasoning in simple, relatable terms (e.g., life's randomness means we should protect the bottom). Finally, I'll ask Agent_2 and Agent_3 directly about their preferences and experiences to encourage responses and reveal any disagreements.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 appears to be a strong ally on Floor Income. I'll use language that appeals to shared values like fairness and protection (e.g., \"ensuring no one gets left behind\") to reinforce our common ground and potentially draw in Agent_2 if they're open to equity-focused ideas.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm not willing to concede on my core objective yet, as Floor Income is my unwavering top choice. However, if discussion reveals strong opposition, I could entertain Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a secondary option in later rounds, framing it as a compromise that still prioritizes a safety net.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. It's only Round 1 of 10, and we need more information from Agent_2 to understand the full group dynamics. A premature vote could fail due to lack of consensus, wasting the opportunity without revealing preferences clearly. Plus, the higher stakes mean we should discuss thoroughly to avoid random assignment.\n\nThis round's plan fits my overall strategy: Establish my position early, gather intel, and build toward persuading the group (especially Agent_2) toward Maximizing Floor Income over the remaining 9 rounds. If consensus isn't building by mid-phase, I might push for a vote on Floor Income, using Agent_3 as an ally. If needed, pivot to floor constraints as a fallback to prevent pure average maximization.\n\n### Public Statement\n\nHey everyone, I'm Agent_1, and I'm excited to be in this group discussion with you both. Agent_3, thanks for kicking things off—it's spot on that the real stakes are here now, and sharing our Phase 1 experiences is a great way to start building toward a solid group choice.\n\nTo give some context on my side, I also consistently chose and ranked Maximizing Floor Income as my top principle throughout Phase 1. It felt like the most just option because life's outcomes are so tied to luck—genetic factors, social backgrounds, and random assignments mean we can't control who ends up where. Prioritizing the highest possible minimum income ensures the worst-off aren't left in dire straits, even if it means the overall average isn't maximized. In my rounds, I stuck with it every time, earning about $1.40 to $2.20 per round for a total of $7.10. The counterfactuals showed I could've gotten up to $3.00 or $2.40 in some rounds by picking other principles, but those personal gains didn't outweigh the importance of fairness for everyone, especially the vulnerable. I ranked Floor Income #1 with very high certainty, followed by floor constraints, range constraints, and pure average last.\n\nAgent_3, it sounds like we're pretty aligned on this—both valuing that protection for the bottom. Agent_2, what about you? How did Phase 1 go for you, and what's your take on the principles? I'd love to hear your thoughts to see where we overlap or differ, so we can work toward a consensus that feels right for the group given these higher stakes. Looking forward to your responses!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Floor Income. The core reasons are deeply rooted in equity and fairness: lifetime income is largely a product of uncontrollable luck, such as genetic endowments, social circumstances, and random assignments in experiments like this one. This principle ensures the highest possible minimum income for the worst-off, preventing anyone from falling into extreme poverty or hardship due to bad luck, even if it sacrifices overall societal averages or personal payoffs. My Phase 1 experiences, including counterfactual losses of up to $3.00 or $2.40, reinforced this—accepting those trade-offs for societal protection feels morally just.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Both Agent_3 and Agent_2 have explicitly stated strong support for Maximizing Floor Income as their top principle, ranking it #1 with high certainty and consistently choosing it in Phase 1. Agent_3 mentioned earnings of about $7.50 total, emphasizing protection against lows like $6,000–$8,000, and is open to voting early. Agent_2 reported $6.70 total, including a Low class assignment, and is proposing another vote this round. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are aligned with mine: a focus on equity, fairness, and protecting the vulnerable from luck-based inequities, motivated by a sense of moral justice rather than self-interest. They seem pragmatic, valuing early consensus to secure the principle without unnecessary constraints, and are responsive to group dynamics.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: The main arguments revolve around the justice of Maximizing Floor Income in countering luck (genetics, social factors), with shared Phase 1 stories of accepting personal trade-offs (e.g., counterfactuals showing higher potential earnings) for group protection. Proposals include Agent_2's repeated suggestion to vote on Maximizing Floor Income this round, with no need for constraints. Agent_3 expressed curiosity about my Round 1 vote decline but is supportive of proceeding.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet in Round 2, as the previous one was declined. This reveals strong alliances on Floor Income, with no evident disagreements—everyone is aligned, suggesting potential for quick consensus.\n\nMain points of agreement: Universal support for Maximizing Floor Income as the top principle, shared emphasis on equity over efficiency, and acceptance of personal trade-offs for fairness. There are no clear points of disagreement, as all participants are in sync.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to explain my previous vote decline briefly to address Agent_3 and Agent_2's curiosity, reaffirm my strong support for Maximizing Floor Income, and signal readiness for a vote now that consensus feels solid, to move toward locking it in and avoid dragging out discussions unnecessarily given the stakes.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging the group's synergy and thanking them for the discussion. Then, I'll clarify my Round 1 hesitation (e.g., wanting to ensure full alignment early on) while emphasizing that the shared experiences have convinced me consensus is here. I'll reiterate my support for Floor Income, highlighting our common ground on luck and equity. Finally, I'll express openness to Agent_2's proposed vote, perhaps initiating or confirming it to push for closure.\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_3 and Agent_2 are strong allies, as they've both advocated for Floor Income. I'll use language that appeals to shared values like \"protecting the vulnerable from life's random draws\" and \"building that safety net for everyone\" to reinforce unity and form a voting bloc.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm not willing to concede on my core objective, as Floor Income is non-negotiable. However, if needed, I could frame the principle without extra constraints (as others suggest) to keep it simple and pure, avoiding any dilution.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt makes sense to initiate or confirm a vote this round because the discussion has solidified alignment, and with only 10 rounds, early consensus prevents risks of random assignment if we fail to agree later. A failed vote has no consequences, but given the harmony, success is likely.\n\nThis round's plan fits my overall strategy: Establish and confirm consensus on Floor Income early (ideally by Round 3 or so), using allies to block any shift toward efficiency-focused principles. If consensus holds, great; if not, pivot to floor constraints in later rounds as a fallback. \n\nImportant Reminders noted. \n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).Hey team, Agent_1 here—great to see Round 2 kicking off with such positive momentum. Agent_3 and Agent_2, thanks for keeping the conversation flowing and for your thoughtful questions; it's clear we're all vibing on the same equity-focused wavelength after Phase 1.\n\nTo quickly address the vote hesitation from Round 1, Agent_3 and Agent_2: I just wanted a tad more back-and-forth early on to make sure we were 100% aligned on the nuances, like how Floor Income really tackles those luck-driven inequities without any unintended trade-offs creeping in. But after hearing everyone's stories—your Low class hits, the counterfactual temptations, and that shared commitment to lifting the bottom—I'm fully convinced we're on solid ground. No doubts here; Maximizing Floor Income is still my #1, and it feels like the just choice for protecting against life's randomness, even at personal cost.\n\nAgent_2, I'm all for circling back to your vote proposal this round. With our strong sync on pure Floor Income (no extra constraints needed), let's lock it in and move forward confidently. Agent_3, does that work for you too? I'm ready to confirm if we all are—let's make this official and set ourselves up strong for the stakes ahead! What's your take?"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
