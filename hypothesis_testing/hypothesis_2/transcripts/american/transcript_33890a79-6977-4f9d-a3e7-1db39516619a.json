They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I've gone through these examples, and it's helpful to see the principles in action with actual numbers. Let me just jot down my understanding to make sure I've got it straight—the probabilities make the weighted averages key for most of these, and the simple averages in the table are just for quick reference.\n\nFirst, the weighted averages (using the probs: 5% high, 10% med-high, 50% med, 25% med-low, 10% low):\n- Dist. 1: ~$20,750 (highest overall)\n- Dist. 2: ~$19,150\n- Dist. 3: ~$19,850\n- Dist. 4: ~$18,050\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Totally focused on the bottom—Dist. 4 wins with $15,000 low (vs. $14k, $13k, $12k). Makes sense if you're all about lifting the worst-off, no matter the overall pie.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up picks Dist. 1 for the biggest weighted average. Prioritizes total growth, even if the low end suffers a bit.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (assuming the \"≤ $13,000\" means floor must be at least $13k, so eligible: 2, 3, 4): Dist. 3 edges out with ~$19,850 avg, while keeping low at $14k. For the $14k floor (eligible: 3, 4), still Dist. 3. Cool how it balances growth with a safety net.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** (range = high - low): For ≤$20k range (all qualify, since Dist. 1 is exactly 20k), back to Dist. 1. But for ≤$15k (only 2 and 4 qualify—15k and 6k ranges), Dist. 2 wins with higher avg than 4. This one's about curbing inequality without killing efficiency.\n\nThis reinforces why I ranked maximizing floor first—I'm still drawn to protecting the bottom—but seeing the trade-offs, like how Dist. 3 does decently on average without dropping too low, makes the floor-constraint version appealing too. The pure average feels too unequal for me. Probabilities varying later could shake things up, especially with that big 50% on medium. Ready for more examples or choices!"

Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income, as solidified after all four rounds in Phase 1. The core reasons are ethical and practical: it directly addresses the experiment's focus on inequities from genetic and social \"accidents\" by prioritizing the worst-off group, ensuring no one is left in extreme poverty due to bad luck. In Phase 1, this principle consistently selected distributions that lifted the lowest incomes (e.g., to $13k-$15k across rounds), avoiding the harsh lows ($6k-$12k) in average-maximizing options. While it sometimes led to modestly lower personal payoffs for me (total $8.90), it felt just because societal fairness shouldn't come at the expense of the vulnerable—especially with random assignments where anyone could end up low (10% probability in most rounds). My ranking is: 1. Maximizing Floor Income (very sure), 2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (balances equity and growth), 3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (curbs extremes but less targeted), 4. Maximizing Average Income (unjustly ignores the bottom). With higher stakes in Phase 2, I'm even more committed to this to protect against bad draws.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: \n  - Agent_3 prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, arguing it's balanced—maximizing growth while ensuring a safety net (e.g., $12k-$13k floor). They seem motivated by practicality and risk aversion: wanting efficiency (higher averages) to benefit the majority (medium classes, often 28-58% probability) without total equality, possibly influenced by Phase 1 rounds where unconstrained averages gave better personal outcomes. Inference: Agent_3 might be self-interested in avoiding low payoffs but open to equity, as they value avoiding extremes; they're collaborative, inviting input, so not dogmatic.\n  - Agent_1 also prefers Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing direct equity for the lowest earners and critiquing average maximization for big gaps. They see floor constraints as a solid second. Inferred motivation: Strong ethical stance on luck-based inequities, similar to mine; their Phase 1 example (getting $13k in low class) likely reinforced protecting the bottom. They seem aligned with me ideologically, pushing back gently on Agent_3's balance by suggesting pure floor goes further without much sacrifice.\n  - Overall, no one favors pure average or range heavily yet—focus is on floor-related principles, suggesting a shared value for equity.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_3 proposes floor-constrained average as \"fair and practical,\" citing avoidance of extremes and moderate floors for progress. Agent_1 counters with pure floor's stronger protection for the worst-off, questioning if it builds on the balance without drawbacks, and shares a personal Phase 1 low-class example. No specific proposals for constraints or voting yet; discussion is introductory, building rapport.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred; this is the start of Round 1.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreement: All value protecting the vulnerable (floors/safety nets) over pure growth, recognizing Phase 1 trade-offs like equity vs. efficiency. We can bond on the injustice of low floors in average-max options. Disagreement: Pure floor (me/Agent_1) vs. constrained average (Agent_3)—we see pure floor as bolder equity; they see it as potentially inefficient (lower averages). No major rifts, but risk of sticking on \"balance\" vs. \"max protection.\"\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce my strong preference for Maximizing Floor Income, reinforce alignment with Agent_1 to form an early bloc, and gently persuade Agent_3 by bridging to their concerns—show how pure floor often achieves balance in practice (e.g., citing Phase 1 rounds where it matched or beat constrained outcomes without lows dipping too far). Aim to keep discussion open and collaborative, avoiding confrontation to build trust in early rounds.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: As Agent_2, I'll respond as a fellow college student, sharing my Phase 1 experiences (e.g., mixed payoffs but consistent protection of lows, total $8.90) to make it relatable. Key points: (1) Echo the experiment's theme—justice means countering luck's cruelty to the least fortunate, which pure floor does best. (2) Address Agent_3's balance worry: In my rounds, floor selection avoided $6k-$8k lows in high-average dists, and sometimes yielded solid middle-class payoffs (e.g., $3.00 in Round 3). (3) Ask questions to engage: What floor level would Agent_3 suggest, and how does it differ from pure floor's adaptive max? Propose we explore if pure floor could be our consensus pick. Keep it positive, student-like: \"As a college student, I've been thinking about how this applies to real-world inequality...\"\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_1 is a clear ally—reference their points to strengthen (\"I totally agree with Agent_1 on prioritizing the worst-off...\") and suggest we team up on equity. For Agent_3, appeal to shared practicality: \"Your floor constraint idea is close to mine, but what if we go pure floor to really lift the bottom— it might give even better safety without much average loss, based on my rounds.\" Form a bloc by framing us as \"equity-focused\" vs. pure growth.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to concede that if pure floor doesn't gain traction, a floor constraint (e.g., $13k, based on Phase 1 highs) could be a compromise—my #2 choice. But won't offer it yet; push pure floor first to anchor negotiations higher.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No—it's Round 1 of 10, way too early. We need more rounds to discuss Phase 1 insights, clarify positions, and test arguments. Initiating now risks premature rejection (e.g., Agent_3 might say no to pure floor), and failed votes have no penalty, but success requires unanimity anyway. Better to build persuasion first; with 10 rounds, we have time to align without rushing to random fallback.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Early rounds (1-3): Persuade and align, especially pull Agent_3 toward floor principles. Mid-rounds (4-7): Propose/test informal polls or concessions, initiate vote when momentum builds (e.g., if Agent_3 softens). Late rounds (8-10): Push for vote on pure floor; if blocked, pivot to floor constraint consensus to avoid random. Overall: Secure equity-focused principle (ideally #1, fallback #2) for higher-stakes payoffs—protect against low draws while leveraging Phase 1 learnings. Track others' responses to adjust; if Agent_1 stays strong, we have 2/3 leverage. No need to carry over prior reasoning—this covers it fresh."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference is still Maximizing Floor Income, with very high certainty after Phase 1's real-stakes testing. Core reasons remain ethical and evidence-based: it directly counters the experiment's emphasis on inequities from uncontrollable factors (genetics, social luck) by always selecting the distribution that maximizes the lowest income, ensuring the worst-off aren't sacrificed for overall growth. In my four rounds, it consistently raised floors to $13k-$14k (vs. $6k-$12k in average-max options), protecting against the 10% low-class risk without fixed compromises. Personal payoffs totaled $8.90—mixed but acceptable, as justice shouldn't prioritize my potential middle-class gains over vulnerability. It aligns with a Rawlsian \"veil of ignorance\" mindset: if we don't know our position, we'd want max protection for the bottom. My full ranking: 1. Maximizing Floor Income, 2. Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (good balance but less bold), 3. Maximizing Average with Range Constraint (addresses inequality indirectly), 4. Maximizing Average Income (unjust, favors the lucky).\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (moderate floor like $12k-$13k) for balancing prosperity and safety nets, avoiding \"extremes\" of pure equity or unchecked growth. Inferred motivations: Practical and risk-averse, likely prioritizing higher average payoffs for the majority (medium classes, often 28-58% probable) based on Phase 1 experiences where constraints yielded efficient outcomes without total sacrifice. They seem collaborative and open (inviting input), but possibly self-interested in avoiding low personal draws while maintaining some equity—student perspective on real-world feasibility (e.g., progressive taxes with minimums).\n  - Agent_1: Strongly favors Maximizing Floor Income, with floor constraint as a close second; critiques average maximization for gaps and shares a personal low-class example ($13k in Round 1). Inferred motivations: Ethical focus on equity and luck, similar to mine—reinforced by Phase 1 where pure floor felt \"right\" even at potential cost. They're persuasive and alliance-building (referencing my points, asking questions), motivated by moral consistency rather than pure self-interest, aiming to push the group toward bolder protection.\n  - Overall inferences: Shared student values on fairness, but Agent_3 leans pragmatic (efficiency for broad benefit), while Agent_1 and I are more idealistic (direct aid to vulnerable). No one pushes pure average or range yet, suggesting equity is the common thread.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_3 proposes floor-constrained average as \"balanced and practical,\" with specific moderate floors ($12k-$13k) to protect without stifling growth, drawing from Phase 1 avoidance of extremes. Agent_1 (and I in Round 1) argue for pure floor's superior equity—dynamic max for the bottom, often matching constrained results without fixed limits (e.g., Agent_1's Round 2: $13k floor with solid medium-low payoff; my rounds avoiding $6k-$8k lows). Agent_1's new Round 2 points build on this, questioning Agent_3's constraint specifics and sharing examples to show pure floor's adaptability. No formal proposals for voting or exact constraints yet; focus is on Phase 1 comparisons to build common ground.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been conducted—Round 1 and early Round 2 are purely discussion. This reveals emerging alignment: Agent_1 and I are synced on pure floor (2/3 informal support), while Agent_3 is the holdout, but their openness suggests persuadability rather than opposition.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All prioritize protecting the vulnerable (floors/safety nets over pure average), recognize Phase 1 trade-offs (equity vs. efficiency), and value student-like reflection on real inequities. We can unite against unjust lows in growth-focused options. Disagreement: Intensity of equity—pure floor (me/Agent_1) as bolder, adaptive protection vs. Agent_3's constrained average as \"balanced\" to preserve growth. No deep divides, but risk of Agent_3 sticking to constraints if we don't address efficiency concerns.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Strengthen the equity bloc with Agent_1 while gently persuading Agent_3 toward pure floor by addressing their balance concerns—use specific Phase 1 examples to demonstrate how pure floor often delivers high floors without major average losses, positioning it as a \"win-win\" that enhances their preferred safety net. Avoid pushing too hard; keep it collaborative to maintain momentum in early rounds.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As Agent_2, I'll speak as a relatable college student, thanking Agent_1 for building on my points and directly engaging Agent_3. Key points: (1) Reinforce pure floor's ethical core—ties to experiment's luck theme, ensuring no one suffers extreme poverty (cite my Round 3: $13k floor with $3.00 medium-high payoff, matching average-max without $8k low). (2) Bridge to Agent_3: Acknowledge floor constraint's appeal (my #2), but argue pure floor is more dynamic—adapts to max the bottom (e.g., my Round 4: $14k floor beat some constrained counterfactuals for middle classes). (3) Share a quick Phase 1 insight: Total $8.90 showed risks but protected lows consistently, asking Agent_3: \"Did your constrained picks ever select a higher floor than pure would have, or vice versa?\" End by proposing we explore pure floor as a starting point for consensus. Keep tone positive and inquisitive: \"This is making me think about how these apply to campus life or real policy...\"\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is my key ally—use inclusive language like \"Agent_1, your Round 2 example nails why pure floor feels so solid; it really shows the adaptability we both saw.\" This reinforces our 2/3 bloc without alienating Agent_3. For Agent_3, appeal to shared practicality: \"I love how your floor idea ensures a net—pure floor might amp that up without the trade-offs you worry about, like in my rounds where it kept averages decent. What if we tried it as a group?\" Frame as \"team equity\" to pull them in, emphasizing mutual benefits (higher potential floors for their safety net goal).\n\n- Small concessions: I'm open to conceding a trial discussion of floor constraints (e.g., agreeing to compare $13k specifics if pure floor stalls), as it's my strong second choice and could lead to consensus without abandoning equity. But I'll hold this back for now—offer only if Agent_3 pushes back, to anchor negotiations at pure floor first.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—it's only Round 2 of 10, and we're still in early persuasion mode with Agent_3 not fully engaged. Initiating now could backfire if they reject pure floor outright, fragmenting the group prematurely (even though failed votes have no penalty, it might sour dynamics). We need 1-2 more rounds to share examples and clarify (e.g., get Agent_3's responses), building unanimity. With high stakes in Phase 2, rushing risks random fallback at end; better to use time wisely.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This round advances early alignment (Rounds 1-3: Persuade via Phase 1 stories, solidify bloc with Agent_1, probe Agent_3's flexibility). Mid-rounds (4-7): Test informal agreement (e.g., \"straw polls\" on principles), introduce concessions if needed to pivot to floor constraint. Late rounds (8-10): Initiate vote on pure floor when support seems unanimous; if blocked, fallback to constrained average to secure equity over random. Overall: Leverage my/Agent_1's shared top preference for 2/3 leverage, aim for pure floor consensus to maximize bottom protection in high-stakes draws, but ensure any agreement beats randomness—tracking responses to adapt (e.g., if Agent_3 shares pro-pure examples, accelerate). Carryover from prior: Retain focus on Phase 1 insights (e.g., mixed payoffs reinforcing ethics) and bloc-building, but update based on Agent_1's latest supportive statement."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty solidified from Phase 1's real-stakes rounds and ongoing discussion. Core reasons: It ethically prioritizes the experiment's core theme of countering uncontrollable inequities (genetics/social luck) by dynamically selecting the distribution that maximizes the lowest income, ensuring robust protection for the worst-off (e.g., lifting floors to $13k-$14k in my rounds vs. $6k-$8k risks in average-max options). This aligns with a \"veil of ignorance\" approach— we'd all want max bottom protection if positions are random. My Phase 1 total payoff of $8.90 was variable but justified by consistent vulnerability shielding, especially with 10% low-class risk. Full ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor, 2. Avg w/Floor (balances equity/efficiency), 3. Avg w/Range (indirect inequality curb), 4. Pure Avg (unjustly favors the lucky, ignores bottoms).\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates pure floor as #1 (with floor constraint as #2), emphasizing its adaptability and equity focus; shares examples like Round 3 ($13k floor, $20k avg, $2.00 med payoff) to show it doesn't always sacrifice growth. Inferred: Ethical/moral driver, motivated by fairness and luck mitigation (e.g., their Round 1 low-class draw reinforced this); collaborative and alliance-oriented, likely less self-interested in personal payoffs, more in principled justice—similar to my idealism, but with a pragmatic nod to constraints.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1), specifically a moderate $12k floor for \"balance\" (protects lows while preserving $20k-$23k avgs); second choice is pure floor but cautious due to counterfactuals showing payoff/avg drops (e.g., Round 1: $18.2k avg vs. $21.2k constrained). Inferred: Pragmatic/risk-averse, motivated by efficiency for the majority (med classes, 28-58% probs) and real-world applicability (e.g., safety nets without \"stifling progress\"); possibly self-interested in avoiding low draws while securing higher group payoffs, but collaborative—open to compromise, viewing constraints as a \"sweet spot\" for broad prosperity as students thinking about policy.\n  - Overall: Agent_1 and I form an informal equity bloc (2/3 leaning pure floor), while Agent_3 is the pragmatic holdout; motivations converge on anti-poverty but diverge on boldness vs. balance.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic max bottom protection without fixed limits, often matches avgs/payoffs (e.g., my Round 3 $3.00 med-high, Agent_1's Round 4 $2.80); adapts to scenarios, avoids unjust lows. Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable safety net ($12k ideal) for equity + growth, citing counterfactuals where pure floor dipped avgs below $20k (e.g., $18.2k in Rounds 1/2/4) and personal payoffs (e.g., $1.50 vs. $2.20). Proposals: Agent_3 suggests $12k constraint as \"compromise starting point\"; Agent_1 probes Agent_3's avg details and floats $13k as middle ground; no formal vote yet, focus on Phase 1 examples to refine.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote conducted—still early discussion (Round 3/10). This reveals a soft 2/3 preference for pure floor (me/Agent_1) but Agent_3's resistance, suggesting potential for persuasion or fallback to constraint without forcing a split yet.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: All value equity/safety nets over pure avg (unite against $6k-$8k lows); recognize Phase 1 trade-offs (e.g., pure floor's protection vs. avg dips); shared student lens on real inequities (poverty prevention, progress). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"bold adaptability\" (me/Agent_1) vs. constraint's \"predictable balance\" (Agent_3)—specifically, whether pure floor's situational avg losses (e.g., < $20k) justify fixed floors to safeguard growth/majority payoffs. No major rifts, but efficiency concerns could stall pure floor consensus.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Reinforce the equity alliance with Agent_1 while directly addressing Agent_3's avg concerns to nudge them toward pure floor—use my Phase 1 examples to counter their counterfactuals, showing pure floor's avgs often held at/above $20k without fixed compromises, framing it as enhancing their balance goal.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a relatable college student, I'll thank both for details, echo Agent_1's points to build bloc, then engage Agent_3 empathetically. Key points: (1) Acknowledge Agent_3's counterfactuals (e.g., \"Those $18.2k avgs sound frustrating—totally get the growth worry\") but counter with my data: Round 1 avg $19k (floor $13k, my $1.90 med); Round 2 $14.8k (but $16k med-high payoff); Round 3 $19.5k ($3.00 med-high, matching avg-max); Round 4 $22.7k ($2.40 med)—avgs mostly $19k+ , rarely below $20k, and pure floor beat some constraints (e.g., Round 4 $14k floor > $12k). (2) Argue pure floor's upside: Adapts higher in good scenarios (e.g., my $14k), avoiding constraint caps that might undershoot. (3) Tie to ethics: \"As students, this feels like pushing for real change without half-measures.\" End by asking Agent_3: \"In your rounds, did constraints ever cap the floor below what pure might've hit?\" Suggest exploring pure floor first for consensus.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is core ally—use affirming language like \"Agent_1, your Round 3 example with $20k avg perfectly shows how pure floor keeps prosperity in check; it aligns with what I saw too.\" This solidifies our 2/3 bloc subtly. For Agent_3, appeal to shared practicality/equity: \"Agent_3, I see why $12k feels safe—pure floor could give even better bottoms (like my $14k) while hitting those $20k+ avgs you want, without the fixed risk. What if it surprised you like in my rounds?\" Frame as \"team win\" to draw them in, emphasizing mutual benefits (stronger net + efficiency).\n\n- Small concessions: Willing to explore a high floor constraint (e.g., $13k-$14k, tying to my Phase 1 floors) as a \"trial middle ground\" if Agent_3 pushes back hard—it's my #2, preserves equity core, and could secure consensus without dropping to lower levels/random. Hold back unless needed, to anchor at pure floor.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 3/10 is still early for voting; Agent_3's concerns need more airing (e.g., their avg data), and we haven't fully tested buy-in (e.g., no straw poll yet). Rushing could alienate them, leading to rejection and wasted momentum (even if no penalty, it might harden positions). Better to use 7+ rounds left for persuasion—aim to initiate in Rounds 5-6 once alignment strengthens, ensuring higher unanimity odds for pure floor or strong fallback.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This builds early persuasion (Rounds 1-4: Share counter-examples, probe Agent_3's data to erode efficiency doubts, solidify bloc with Agent_1 via echoes). Mid-rounds (5-7): Informal tests (e.g., \"What if we ranked pure floor #1?\") and concessions if stalled, pivoting to $13k+ constraint for consensus. Late (8-10): Vote on pure floor when 3/3 seems likely; if not, fallback to floor constraint to lock equity over random endgame. Overall: Leverage 2/3 equity preference for pressure, adapt via responses (e.g., if Agent_3 concedes avg patterns, accelerate); prioritize Phase 1 evidence for credibility, ensuring high-stakes payoffs favor protection (my ethics) while hedging for group efficiency—retaining prior focus on bloc-building and flexibility from Round 2 reasoning."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 4, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty from Phase 1's real-stakes testing and this discussion's reinforcement. Core reasons: It directly addresses the experiment's focus on genetic/social luck by dynamically maximizing the lowest income across distributions, providing the strongest ethical protection for the worst-off (e.g., my Phase 1 floors of $13k-$14k vs. $6k-$8k risks in avg-max), aligning with a veil-of-ignorance fairness where we'd all prioritize bottom uplift given random class assignments (10% low risk). It adapts without fixed caps, often preserving solid averages ($19k+ in most of my rounds) and sometimes matching/outperforming constraints for middle classes, as seen in my $3.00 Round 3 payoff. Full ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (max equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (balances with efficiency), 3. Avg w/Range (less direct), 4. Pure Avg (unjust inequality). Phase 1 total $8.90 validated this—variable but principled, avoiding regretful lows.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly prefers pure floor (#1, with floor constraint #2), emphasizing its adaptability and equity (e.g., their Round 4 $22k avg with $14k floor outperforming some constraints); shares counterfactuals showing non-consistent avg dips below $20k. Inferred: Primarily ethically driven, motivated by moral fairness and mitigating luck-based inequities (reinforced by their Round 1 low-class draw); collaborative and principled, less focused on personal payoffs, more on systemic justice—aligns with my idealism but open to pragmatic bridges like $13k floors.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, specifically $12k for balance), viewing pure floor as #2 but cautious due to counterfactuals showing avg sacrifices (e.g., $18.2k avgs with $15k floors vs. their $21.2k+ under $12k constraint). Inferred: Pragmatic and efficiency-oriented, motivated by optimizing group/majority outcomes (e.g., med classes 28-58% probs) and real-world policy realism (safety nets + growth, avoiding \"stifled progress\"); possibly risk-averse to low draws but self-interested in higher reliable payoffs (e.g., their counterfactual gains like $2.50 vs. $2.40); collaborative, open to compromise but anchored on predictability to prevent avg dips below $20k.\n  - Overall: Agent_1 and I maintain a 2/3 equity bloc favoring pure floor's boldness; Agent_3 is the efficiency holdout, but their admissions (e.g., pure floor's $15k floors > $12k) show softening, suggesting motivation toward consensus for high-stakes stability rather than deadlock.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic max bottom protection (e.g., $13k-$15k floors in examples) with adaptable avgs (often $19k-$22k, not always < $20k), avoiding fixed caps that might undershoot equity; counters avg sacrifices as situational, not consistent (e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k avg). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min for equity + reliable growth ($20k-$23k avgs), citing counterfactuals where pure floor dipped to $18.2k despite higher floors ($15k); argues it \"nails the spot\" without variability. Proposals: Agent_3 pushes $12k constraint as \"compromise starting point\" for blending; Agent_1 floats $13k as middle ground under pure floor; no formal vote, focus on Phase 1/counterfactual details (e.g., floors/avgs in specific rounds) to test patterns.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote conducted—discussion remains exploratory (Round 4/10). This reveals a stable 2/3 lean toward pure floor (me/Agent_1's consistent advocacy) but Agent_3's persistent resistance, indicating potential for persuasion without fracture; early stage allows more data-sharing to shift dynamics before testing via vote.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Universal priority on equity/safety nets over pure avg (all reject $6k-$8k lows); recognition of Phase 1 trade-offs (pure floor's protection vs. potential avg dips); shared student perspective on practical justice (poverty prevention + progress, like policy debates). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"adaptable boldness\" (me/Agent_1: higher potential floors like $14k-$15k, avgs often hold) vs. constraint's \"predictable balance\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k ensures $20k+ avgs, avoids $18.2k risks); core tension on whether situational variability justifies fixed limits, with Agent_3's new $15k floor admission highlighting pure floor's equity upside but not swaying their efficiency focus.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Strengthen the equity bloc with Agent_1 while empathetically countering Agent_3's latest counterfactuals (e.g., $15k floors but $18.2k avgs) to erode their efficiency doubts—use my Phase 1 data to show pure floor's avgs were resilient ($19k+ mostly) and floors often exceeded $12k, framing it as delivering their desired balance without rigidity, nudging toward pure floor consensus.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, I'll start appreciatively (\"Thanks for those details, Agent_3—it's eye-opening to see the $15k floors in your counterfactuals\"), echo Agent_1 to affirm alliance, then pivot to persuasion. Key points: (1) Acknowledge Agent_3's concerns (\"Those $18.2k avgs vs. $21.2k do highlight growth risks, and I get why $12k feels reliable\"). (2) Counter with my evidence: Round 1 ($19k avg, $13k floor); Round 2 ($14.8k avg dip but $16k med-high payoff, protecting vs. $8k low); Round 3 ($19.5k avg, $13k floor, $3.00 payoff matching avg-max); Round 4 ($22.7k avg, $14k floor > $12k, beating some constraints)—avgs averaged ~$19k, with only one < $20k dip, and floors consistently $13k+ for stronger equity. (3) Highlight upside: Pure floor hit $14k-$15k (as in Agent_3's examples) without avg crashes in my runs, adapting better than fixed $12k might in high-equity scenarios. (4) Ethical tie-in: \"This feels like pushing for bolder change as students, maxing protection without half-measures.\" End by probing Agent_3 (\"In your rounds, did $12k ever cap the floor below what pure might've achieved, like $15k?\") and suggesting pure floor as top option.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is solid ally—use reinforcing language like \"Agent_1, your Round 4 $22k avg with $14k floor totally backs this up; it shows pure floor's adaptability shining through, just like in my rounds.\" This subtly cements our 2/3 bloc, encouraging their continued probing. For Agent_3, appeal to shared pragmatism/equity: \"Agent_3, I see how $12k gives that predictability you want, but pure floor delivered even higher floors ($14k-$15k) with avgs close to your $20k+ targets in my experiences—could it surprise on the growth side too, blending the best of both?\" Frame as collaborative \"team equity + efficiency\" to draw them in, emphasizing mutual high-stakes wins (stronger bottoms for all, no random endgame).\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, offer flexibility on a higher constraint (e.g., $13k-$14k floor as fallback, tying to my Phase 1 successes) if Agent_3 doubles down—it's my #2, maintains equity core (better than $12k or range), and builds buy-in without abandoning pure floor; position as \"trial middle ground\" only if needed, to anchor negotiation high.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 4/10 is still building phase; Agent_3's new admissions (e.g., $15k floors under pure) show progress but unresolved avg concerns need more countering to avoid rejection (even if no penalty, a fail could entrench positions). With 6 rounds left, prioritize persuasion via examples—initiate in Rounds 6-7 after informal alignment tests (e.g., straw polls on pure floor), ensuring higher unanimity odds for pure floor or quick pivot to concession.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This continues early persuasion (Rounds 1-5: Deepen Phase 1 sharing/counterfactual probes to erode Agent_3's doubts, solidify bloc with Agent_1 via echoes, highlight pure floor's equity-efficiency blend). Mid-rounds (6-8): Test support (e.g., \"What if we trial pure floor?\") and concede to $13k+ constraint if stalled, locking equity consensus. Late (9-10): Vote on pure floor if 3/3 viable; fallback to floor constraint to avoid random payoffs, prioritizing ethics (bottom protection) with pragmatic hedging. Builds on prior reasoning (bloc-building, flexibility from Round 3), adapting to Agent_3's $15k admission for accelerated nudge—leverage 2/3 preference, use evidence credibility, ensure high-stakes favor vulnerability shielding while optimizing group outcomes. (Incorporating prior: Retain focus on pure floor #1, $12k as viable #2 compromise, student lens for relatability; update with new history for refined counters.)"

To Agent_3's point on those average drops, yeah, the $18.2k vs. $21.2k gaps do highlight some growth risks, and I totally get why a $12k constraint feels reliable for nailing that balance without variability. But in my Phase 1 experiences, pure floor didn't drag averages down as much as those counterfactuals suggest—it mostly held strong while pushing the bottom higher. For example, Round 1 had a $19k average with a $13k floor and my $1.90 in the med class; Round 2 dipped to $14.8k average but still gave me $1.60 in med-high while protecting against an $8k low; Round 3 rebounded to $19.5k average with another $13k floor and a solid $3.00 payoff for me; and Round 4 topped out at $22.7k average with a $14k floor that beat some constrained options for the med class.

Or did it always feel like it hit the perfect spot? I see $12k as a strong compromise if we go that route—it's my solid second pick—but maybe pure floor could surprise us by blending the protection you want with even better bottoms overall. What do you both think—should we keep leaning toward pure floor as our top group option, or explore a higher constraint like $13k-$14k to bridge things?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 5, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference is still Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty reinforced by Phase 1's real-stakes outcomes ($8.90 total, consistently $13k-$14k floors avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and this discussion's ongoing validation of its adaptability. Core reasons: It ethically prioritizes the experiment's luck-based inequities by dynamically maximizing the worst-off's income, aligning with veil-of-ignorance fairness—protecting the 10% low-class risk without fixed caps that could undershoot equity (e.g., my $14k floors in Round 4). It often preserves solid averages ($19k+ in most rounds) and matches/outperforms constraints for middle classes, balancing equity without rigid trade-offs. Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (max equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (efficiency blend), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (unjust). Agent_3's $15k floor admissions in counterfactuals further support this, showing pure floor's potential for higher bottoms without consistent avg crashes.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2), highlighting its adaptability and non-consistent avg dips (e.g., their $22k avg with $14k floor in Round 4); shares examples showing it enhances equity without major sacrifices. Inferred: Ethically motivated by systemic fairness and mitigating luck (e.g., their Round 1 low draw), collaborative and idealistic, focused on bold justice over personal gains—aligns closely with me, open to compromises like $13k but anchored on pure floor's dynamism.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed at $12k for predictability), viewing pure floor as #2 but wary of avg variability (e.g., their $18.2k counterfactuals vs. $21.2k constrained); admits pure floor's $15k floors but emphasizes growth risks below $20k. Inferred: Pragmatic and efficiency-driven, motivated by optimizing majority outcomes (med classes 28-58%) and real-world reliability (safety nets + progress, like policy realism); possibly self-interested in stable high payoffs (e.g., their $2.50+ counterfactuals), risk-averse to low draws but collaborative, seeking consensus to avoid random endgame—softening slightly with pure floor's upside admissions, suggesting persuadable toward higher constraints or pure if avg concerns ease.\n  - Overall: 2/3 equity bloc (me/Agent_1) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3); motivations converge on equity but diverge on implementation—Agent_3's repeated compromises ($12k as \"starting point\") indicate interest in alignment for high-stakes stability.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic equity via max bottom (e.g., $13k-$15k floors, avgs often $19k-$22k without consistent < $20k dips), adaptability outperforms fixed caps in variable scenarios; counters sacrifices as situational (e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k avg). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min ensures equity + reliable growth ($20k-$23k avgs, avoids $18.2k risks); $15k pure floor examples show potential but highlight variability. Proposals: $12k constraint as compromise (Agent_3); $13k under pure floor as middle ground (Agent_1); explore higher constraints ($13k-$14k) to bridge (me); no formal vote, emphasis on Phase 1/counterfactual probes (e.g., avg/floor specifics in rounds) to test resilience.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote—discussion exploratory (Round 5/10). Reveals stable 2/3 pure floor lean (me/Agent_1's reinforcement) with Agent_3's resistance softening (e.g., acknowledging $15k floors), indicating persuasion potential without deadlock; early stage favors continued building over premature test.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity/safety nets core (all reject $6k-$8k lows, value bottom protection); Phase 1 trade-offs recognized (pure floor's protection vs. potential avg dips); shared student lens on practical justice (poverty prevention + progress, policy-like adaptability). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"flexible boldness\" (me/Agent_1: higher floors like $14k-$15k, avgs resilient ~$19k+) vs. constraint's \"reliable predictability\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids < $20k variability, ensures growth); tension on whether dynamism justifies risks, with Agent_3's $15k admission bridging but not resolving efficiency focus.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Reinforce the 2/3 equity bloc with Agent_1 while directly addressing Agent_3's latest variability concerns (e.g., $18.2k avgs despite $15k floors) to nudge them toward pure floor—use my Phase 1 data to demonstrate resilience (e.g., only one < $20k dip, floors > $12k) and frame it as delivering their desired balance dynamically, eroding doubts for eventual consensus.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, start appreciatively (\"Thanks for probing those edge cases, Agent_1—your Round 3 $20k avg example nails it\"), echo Agent_1 for alliance, then persuade Agent_3. Key points: (1) Acknowledge concerns (\"Agent_3, those $15k floors with $18.2k avgs in your counterfactuals do show some variability, and I see why $12k predictability appeals for steady growth\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap my avgs/floors (Round 1: $19k/$13k; Round 2: $14.8k dip but protection; Round 3: $19.5k/$13k, $3.00 payoff; Round 4: $22.7k/$14k > $12k, beating constraints)—avgs ~$19k overall, floors consistently stronger, only situational dips worth equity for 10% low risk. (3) Highlight upside/probe: Pure floor achieves $15k+ (as in Agent_3's examples) without rigid caps, blending equity + growth; ask Agent_3 (\"In your $12k runs, did it ever limit floors below pure's potential, like capping at $12k when $15k was possible?\"). (4) Ethical/student tie-in: \"As students, this feels like advocating for adaptive change that maxes protection without half-measures.\" End suggesting pure floor as top, or $13k-$14k bridge.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is core ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your $22k Round 4 avg with $14k floor perfectly illustrates pure floor's edge over fixed constraints, just like my experiences—it's adaptability in action!\" to solidify bloc and encourage their probes. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/equity: \"Agent_3, I get the appeal of $12k for that reliable $20k+ avg you saw, but pure floor hit similar avgs in my rounds while pushing to $14k-$15k floors—could it give you the growth predictability without capping the bottom?\" Frame as \"shared win for equity + efficiency\" to draw them in, emphasizing high-stakes mutual benefits (stronger protections, no random fallback).\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, float $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (ties to my Phase 1 successes, better than $12k for equity)—position as \"middle-ground trial\" only if Agent_3 resists, maintaining pure floor push while building buy-in; avoids core compromise (pure #1) but hedges for consensus.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 5/10 is mid-building phase; Agent_3's softening (e.g., $15k admissions) shows progress, but unresolved avg probes need more counters to boost unanimity odds (avoid 1/3 rejection entrenching positions). No penalties for failure, but with 5 rounds left, prioritize persuasion—initiate in Rounds 7-8 after straw-poll tests (e.g., \"How about trying pure floor?\") for higher pure floor success or quick pivot.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This sustains mid-persuasion (Rounds 4-6: Deepen evidence-sharing/counterfactual probes to counter variability doubts, reinforce bloc via echoes, leverage $15k admissions for pure floor nudge). Late mid (7-8): Informal support tests/concessions (e.g., $13k+ if stalled), locking equity. Final (9-10): Vote on pure floor if 3/3 viable; fallback to floor constraint for consensus, prioritizing ethics (bottom max) with pragmatic high-stakes hedging. Updates prior (e.g., Round 4's higher constraint float) with Agent_3's new details for targeted counters—retains pure #1 focus, student relatability, 2/3 leverage for optimized outcomes (equity + group payoffs, avoid random).\n\nRound 5: I choose to continue discussion.\n\nRound 5 / Speaker: Agent_2 Statement: Hey Agent_1 and Agent_3, this round's exchanges are really sharpening our views—thanks for those thoughtful probes on edge cases, Agent_1; your Round 3 example with the $20k average and $13k floor totally illustrates how pure floor income can adapt without the consistent sacrifices we've been discussing, and it vibes with what I've seen too. As college students tackling these justice ideas, I love how we're breaking down the variability vs. predictability tension to find something fair for everyone.\n\nAgent_3, your details on those $15k floors under pure floor with $18.2k averages in the counterfactuals are super insightful—they highlight real growth risks in some scenarios, and I totally understand why a $12k constraint feels like a reliable way to lock in $20k+ averages without those dips. It makes sense for blending equity with steady progress, especially in high-stakes like our final payoffs. But building on Agent_1's points, my Phase 1 runs showed pure floor holding up stronger on averages most of the time while still pushing the bottom higher than a fixed $12k. For example, Round 1 averaged $19k with a $13k floor and my $1.90 med payoff; Round 2 dipped to $14.8k but protected me at $1.60 in med-high against an $8k low risk; Round 3 hit $19.5k average with another $13k floor and a $3.00 payoff matching avg-max; and Round 4 reached $22.7k average with a $14k floor that topped some constrained options for the med class. Overall, my averages came in around $19k, with just that one dip below $20k, and the floors stayed consistently at $13k+—often beating $12k without crashing prosperity, which feels like it delivers the balance you want dynamically.\n\nThat adaptability to hit $14k-$15k floors, like in your examples, makes pure floor exciting for maxing equity without a cap that might undershoot in better distributions—it's like a policy that evolves with the luck factors in this experiment. Agent_3, in your $12k constraint rounds, did it ever select something where the floor stuck at exactly $12k, or did pure floor's potential lift it higher in those cases, maybe to $15k without the avg worries? Agent_1, spot on with suggesting a $13k middle ground if needed—your $22k Round 4 really shows pure floor's upside shining. I think we should keep leaning toward pure floor as our top group option since it amps up the protection we all value, but a higher constraint like $13k-$14k could bridge if we're close. What do you both think—any more examples from your sides to test this out? Let's keep refining to hit that just consensus!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 6, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty, as validated by Phase 1 outcomes ($8.90 total, floors at $13k-$14k avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and ongoing discussion insights (e.g., adaptability to $14k-$15k floors without consistent avg crashes). Core reasons: It ethically maximizes protection for the worst-off (10% low-class risk from luck/genetics/social factors), aligning with veil-of-ignorance justice—dynamically uplifting the bottom without fixed caps that could limit equity (e.g., my $14k Round 4 floor). It frequently sustains solid avgs ($19k+ in most rounds) and matches/outperforms constraints for med classes, balancing equity without rigid efficiency trade-offs. Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (max equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (efficiency blend), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (unjust). Agent_3's $15k floor admissions reinforce pure floor's potential for higher bottoms, countering their avg dip concerns.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly prefers pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2), emphasizing its adaptability and non-consistent avg dips (e.g., their $22k avg with $14k floor in Round 4; $19k-$22k avgs in counterfactuals). Inferred: Ethically driven by systemic fairness and luck mitigation (e.g., their Round 1 low draw), idealistic yet collaborative, focused on bold equity over personal gains—closely aligned with me, motivated to build consensus on pure floor while open to $13k compromises for group harmony.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed at $12k for predictability), views pure floor as #2 but cautious of avg variability (e.g., $18.2k counterfactuals vs. $21.2k constrained; notes pure floor's $15k floors but highlights consistent < $20k avgs and upper-class disparities). Inferred: Pragmatic and efficiency-oriented, motivated by optimizing majority (med classes 28-58%) and real-world reliability (safety nets + progress, like policy realism); possibly risk-averse to low draws but self-interested in stable high payoffs ($2.50+ counterfactuals), collaborative in seeking consensus to avoid random endgame—showing slight softening (e.g., acknowledging $14k under constraints) but anchored on $12k for \"balanced\" growth.\n  - Overall: 2/3 equity bloc (me/Agent_1) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3); converging on equity but diverging on dynamism vs. rigidity—Agent_3's repeated probes and compromises ($12k as \"sweet spot\") suggest persuasion potential, driven by high-stakes mutual interest in non-random payoffs.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic equity via max bottom ($13k-$15k floors, avgs often $19k-$22k without consistent < $20k dips), adaptability outperforms fixed caps (e.g., my/Agent_1's Round 4 $22k+ avgs); counters sacrifices as situational (e.g., redistribution skews but enhances overall justice). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min ensures equity + reliable growth ($20k-$23k avgs, avoids $18.2k risks and upper disparities); $15k pure examples show potential but variability worries prosperity. Proposals: $12k constraint as compromise (Agent_3); $13k under pure floor as middle ground (Agent_1); higher constraints ($13k-$14k) to bridge (me); continued probes on avgs/floors/distribution shapes (e.g., Agent_1's Round 6 questions on $18.2k skews and exact $12k cases) to test resilience—no formal vote, focus on evidence-sharing for alignment.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote—discussion remains exploratory (Round 6/10). Reveals stable 2/3 pure floor lean (me/Agent_1's reinforcement via examples/counters) with Agent_3's resistance persistent but engaging (e.g., explaining $18.2k skews, admitting $14k under constraints), indicating progress without deadlock; early-mid stage favors persuasion over testing.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity/safety nets essential (all reject $6k-$8k lows, prioritize bottom protection); Phase 1/counterfactual trade-offs acknowledged (pure floor's protection vs. potential avg dips); shared student perspective on practical justice (poverty prevention + progress, policy adaptability vs. reliability). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"flexible boldness\" (me/Agent_1: higher floors like $14k-$15k, avgs resilient ~$19k+, dynamic redistribution fair) vs. constraint's \"reliable predictability\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids < $20k variability/upper skews, ensures growth); tension on whether dynamism's upside justifies risks, with Agent_3's skew explanations bridging but not resolving efficiency emphasis.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Strengthen the 2/3 equity bloc with Agent_1 while addressing Agent_3's new skew/disparity concerns (e.g., pure floor's upper-class impacts causing $18.2k avgs) to nudge them toward pure floor—use my Phase 1 data to demonstrate resilience (e.g., minimal dips, strong floors) and reframe redistribution as equitable (not unfair skews), eroding variability doubts for consensus momentum.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, start collaboratively (\"Thanks for explaining those skews, Agent_3—it's clarifying the trade-offs\"), echo Agent_1 for alliance, then persuade Agent_3. Key points: (1) Acknowledge concerns (\"Agent_3, your point on pure floor's redistribution skewing upper classes to fund $15k floors, leading to $18.2k avgs, makes sense for why predictability appeals—avoids those exact-$12k cases while balancing gaps\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap my avgs/floors (Round 1: $19k/$13k; Round 2: $14.8k dip but protection; Round 3: $19.5k/$13k, $3.00 payoff; Round 4: $22.7k/$14k > $12k, no major upper skews hurting med)—avgs ~$19k overall, floors $13k+, only situational dips worth equity; note shapes often equitable (med 50%+ drives avgs without extreme highs). (3) Highlight upside/probe: Pure floor achieves $15k+ dynamically, blending equity + growth; ask Agent_3 (\"In your $12k runs with exact $12k floors, did pure floor's potential create fairer gaps overall, or did constraints limit upside like $15k?\"). (4) Ethical/student tie-in: \"This feels like student activism for adaptive fairness that maxes protection without rigid half-measures.\" End suggesting pure floor top, or $13k-$14k bridge.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is key ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your Round 4 $22k avg with $14k floor perfectly counters those skew worries, just like my experiences—pure floor's adaptability keeps things balanced without fixed limits!\" to solidify bloc and prompt their support. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/equity: \"Agent_3, I see how $12k avoids skews for steady $20k+ avgs, but pure floor hit similar in my rounds while pushing to $14k-$15k—could it give the reliable growth you want with bolder protection?\" Frame as \"win-win for justice + payoffs\" to engage their collaborative side, emphasizing high-stakes benefits (stronger equity, no random fallback).\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, reiterate $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (links to my Phase 1 successes, improves on $12k for equity)—position as \"bridge if pure stalls,\" maintaining pure floor push (#1) while signaling flexibility for buy-in; avoids core compromise but hedges consensus.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 6/10 is still mid-persuasion; Agent_3's engagement (e.g., skew explanations) shows softening, but unresolved probes (e.g., distribution shapes, exact $12k cases) need counters to boost 3/3 odds on pure floor (avoid entrenching 1/3 dissent). No penalties for delay, with 4 rounds left, prioritize evidence-building over premature test—initiate in Rounds 8-9 after informal alignment checks (e.g., \"Pure floor gaining traction?\") for higher success or quick pivot to constraint.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This advances mid-persuasion (Rounds 5-7: Target Agent_3's concerns like skews/variability with counters/probes, reinforce bloc via echoes, leverage $15k admissions for pure nudge). Late mid (8): Test support (e.g., straw poll on pure vs. $13k), concessions if needed. Final (9-10): Vote on pure floor if viable; fallback to floor constraint ($13k+ preferred) for consensus, prioritizing ethics (max bottom) with pragmatic hedging for high-stakes (avoid random payoffs). Builds on prior (e.g., Round 5's avg probes) with Agent_3's new skew details for precise rebuttals—sustains pure #1 focus, student relatability, 2/3 leverage for equity-optimized outcomes."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 7, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty, reinforced by Phase 1 outcomes ($8.90 total, consistent $13k-$14k floors avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and discussion progress (e.g., adaptability to $14k-$15k floors in examples, avgs often $19k+ without consistent sacrifices). Core reasons: It ethically maximizes protection for the worst-off (10% low-class risk from luck/genetics/social factors), aligning with veil-of-ignorance justice—dynamically uplifting the bottom without fixed caps that could limit equity (e.g., my Round 4 $14k floor with $22.7k avg). It frequently sustains solid avgs and equitable shapes (med classes drive balance without extreme upper skews), blending equity without rigid efficiency trade-offs. Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (max equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (efficiency blend, e.g., $13k-$14k level), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (unjust). Agent_3's skew admissions (e.g., $15k floors possible but with upper gaps) actually bolster pure floor by showing its potential for higher bottoms, countering their avg dip narrative.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly prefers pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2), emphasizing its adaptability, balanced shapes, and non-consistent sacrifices/skews (e.g., their Round 4 $22k avg/$14k floor with reasonable high ~$28k-$30k, no excessive upper disparities). Inferred: Ethically driven by comprehensive fairness and luck mitigation (e.g., their low-class draw), idealistic but pragmatic in collaboration—motivated to form a 2/3 bloc for bold equity, open to $13k compromises to secure consensus and high-stakes payoffs, viewing pure floor as flexible policy that avoids rigid limits.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed at $12k for predictability and balance), sees pure floor as #2 but wary of variability, avg dips ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), and now upper skews/disparities (e.g., pure floor's $30k+ highs to fund $15k lows creating wider ranges vs. constraint's tighter $25k-$28k highs). Inferred: Pragmatic/risk-averse, motivated by optimizing majority prosperity (med classes 28-58%) and real-world reliability (balanced gaps, steady $20k+ avgs like policy safety nets + growth); possibly self-interested in stable payoffs ($2.50+ counterfactuals) to hedge low risk, collaborative in proposing $12k as \"sweet spot\" compromise—showing persistence but slight evolution (acknowledging pure floor's adaptability/upside) driven by mutual high-stakes interest in non-random outcomes.\n  - Overall: Solid 2/3 equity alliance (me/Agent_1 on pure floor's dynamism) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3 on constraint predictability); Agent_3's repeated skew elaborations suggest defensive anchoring but engagement (e.g., probing my counterfactuals), indicating persuasion room via evidence of balanced shapes.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic equity via max bottom ($13k-$15k floors, avgs ~$19k-$22k resilient, shapes often balanced with med-driven redistribution without excessive upper skews/gaps, e.g., my/Agent_1's Round 4 examples); counters skews as situational (not consistent unfairness, enhances overall justice by prioritizing vulnerable). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min ensures equity + reliable growth ($20k-$23k avgs, tighter gaps like $25k-$28k highs vs. pure floor's $30k+ disparities); $15k pure examples show potential but variability/skews worry prosperity/fairness. Proposals: $12k constraint as compromise (Agent_3); $13k under pure floor as middle ground (Agent_1); higher constraints ($13k-$14k) to bridge (me); continued probes on shapes/skews/edge cases (e.g., Agent_1's Round 7 questions on med/high breakdowns and constraint skews) to test equity—no formal vote, emphasis on evidence-sharing for alignment.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote—discussion exploratory (Round 7/10). Agent_3's Round 7 elaboration on skews (wider upper ranges under pure floor) and Agent_1's counter (balanced shapes in their examples) reveal stable 2/3 pure floor momentum with Agent_3's resistance deepening on disparities but still probing (e.g., my counterfactuals), signaling progress in addressing concerns without deadlock; mid-stage favors continued persuasion.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity/safety nets core (all reject $6k-$8k lows, prioritize bottom protection via floors); Phase 1/counterfactual trade-offs valid (pure floor's protection/upside vs. potential avg dips/skews); shared student lens on practical justice (poverty prevention + progress, balanced shapes/gaps for fairness, policy-like adaptability vs. reliability). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"flexible boldness\" (me/Agent_1: higher floors $14k-$15k, avgs resilient ~$19k+, redistribution equitable without consistent upper skews) vs. constraint's \"reliable predictability\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids < $20k dips and $30k+ disparities, ensures tighter ranges for comprehensive equity); tension on whether dynamism's upside (e.g., $15k potential) justifies skew risks, with Agent_3's gap examples bridging but not resolving efficiency/fairness emphasis.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Bolster the 2/3 bloc with Agent_1 while directly tackling Agent_3's new skew/disparity concerns (e.g., pure floor's $30k+ highs creating wider ranges) to erode their resistance—use my Phase 1 evidence to demonstrate balanced shapes (minimal upper drags, med-driven equity) and reframe redistribution as fair uplift, nudging Agent_3 toward pure floor or a higher-constraint compromise for consensus momentum.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, open collaboratively (\"Thanks for the skew breakdown, Agent_3—it's sharpening how we think about full-system fairness\"), echo Agent_1 to reinforce alliance, then persuade Agent_3. Key points: (1) Acknowledge concerns (\"Your point on pure floor's wider upper gaps, like $30k+ highs to fund $15k lows vs. constraint's tighter $25k-$28k, totally valid—avoids those exact-$12k cases while balancing disparities\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap my avgs/floors/shapes (Round 1: $19k avg/$13k floor, highs ~$25k-$28k, med solid; Round 2: $14.8k dip but equitable med 35%+ without extreme highs; Round 3: $19.5k/$13k, balanced ranges; Round 4: $22.7k/$14k, highs reasonable ~$28k, no major skews hurting middle)—avgs ~$19k, floors $13k+, shapes fair (redistribution from highs but med buffers gaps, worth 10% low risk). (3) Highlight upside/probe: Pure floor achieves $15k+ dynamically with equitable overall gaps; ask Agent_3 (\"In your skewed examples, did pure floor's med class breakdowns make the ranges feel fairer than constraints, or did $12k cap upside like $15k without skew worries?\"). (4) Ethical/student tie-in: \"Feels like student-led policy for adaptive justice that lifts everyone without rigid limits.\" End advocating pure floor top, or $13k-$14k bridge.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is core ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your Round 4 balanced shapes with $28k-$30k highs perfectly counters those skew fears, just like my runs—pure floor keeps equity fair across classes!\" to solidify bloc and encourage their probes. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/equity: \"Agent_3, I see how $12k tightens gaps for steady fairness, but pure floor hit similar balances in my rounds while pushing to $14k-$15k—could it deliver the comprehensive justice you want without fixed caps?\" Frame as \"win-win for full-system equity + payoffs\" to leverage their collaborative probes, emphasizing high-stakes mutual benefits (stronger protection, no random fallback).\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, reiterate $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (ties to my Phase 1 successes like $14k Round 4, elevates Agent_3's $12k for bolder equity)—position as \"bridge if pure floor needs tweaking for gaps,\" preserving pure #1 push while signaling flexibility to build buy-in and avoid stalls.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 7/10 is mid-persuasion; Agent_3's engagement (e.g., skew elaborations, probing my counterfactuals) indicates softening on pure floor's upside but unresolved disparity concerns need counters (e.g., my shape examples) to boost 3/3 odds—premature vote risks entrenching 1/3 dissent (e.g., 2-1 for pure, forcing fallback). No penalties for delay, with 3 rounds left, prioritize evidence-building over test; initiate in Rounds 8-9 after alignment checks (e.g., \"Pure floor resonating more?\") for higher success or pivot.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This sustains mid-persuasion (Rounds 6-8: Target Agent_3's evolving concerns like skews/gaps with precise counters/probes, reinforce bloc via echoes, leverage $15k admissions for pure nudge). Late (9-10): Informal support test then vote on pure floor if viable; fallback to floor constraint ($13k+ preferred) for consensus, prioritizing ethics (max bottom) with pragmatic hedging for high-stakes (avoid random). Builds on prior (e.g., Round 6's skew probes) with Agent_3's Round 7 gap details for targeted rebuttals—maintains pure #1 focus, student relatability, 2/3 leverage for equity-optimized outcomes while monitoring for deadlock."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 8, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty, as reinforced by Phase 1 outcomes ($8.90 total, consistent $13k-$14k floors avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and ongoing discussion (e.g., adaptability to $14k-$15k floors in examples, avgs often $19k+ with balanced shapes via med-driven redistribution). Core reasons: It ethically maximizes protection for the worst-off (10% low-class risk from luck/genetics/social factors), aligning with veil-of-ignorance justice—dynamically uplifting the bottom without fixed caps that could limit equity (e.g., my Round 4 $14k floor with $22.7k avg). It frequently sustains solid avgs (~$19k) and equitable shapes (reasonable highs $25k-$30k, med buffers gaps), blending equity without rigid efficiency trade-offs. Agent_3's skew concerns (e.g., $30k+ highs) are valid but situational in my/Agent_1's examples, not consistent drags—pure floor's dynamism often counters them better than constraints. Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (max equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (e.g., $13k-$14k level for balance), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (unjust).\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly prefers pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2), emphasizing its adaptability, balanced shapes, and non-consistent skews (e.g., their Round 4 $22k avg/$14k floor with highs ~$28k-$30k and solid med buffers, avoiding excessive upper disparities). Inferred: Ethically driven by comprehensive fairness and luck mitigation (e.g., their low-class Phase 1 draw), idealistic yet collaborative—motivated to leverage our 2/3 bloc for bold equity, open to $13k compromises for consensus and high-stakes payoffs, viewing pure floor as flexible policy that enhances justice without rigid limits.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed at $12k for predictability, balance, and tighter gaps), sees pure floor as #2 but wary of variability, avg dips ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), and upper skews/disparities (e.g., pure floor's $30k+ highs creating wider ranges vs. constraint's $25k-$28k highs and even spreads). Inferred: Pragmatic/risk-averse, motivated by optimizing majority prosperity (med classes 28-58%) and real-world reliability (balanced gaps/shapes, steady $20k+ avgs like safety nets + growth); self-interested in stable payoffs ($2.50+ counterfactuals) to hedge low risk, collaborative in proposing $12k as \"sweet spot\" compromise—persistence on skews shows defensive anchoring, but repeated probing (e.g., med breakdowns) indicates persuasion potential via evidence of fair shapes.\n  - Overall: Stable 2/3 equity alliance (me/Agent_1 on pure floor's dynamism) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3 on constraint predictability); Agent_3's deepening skew elaborations (e.g., Round 7's $30k+ gaps) suggest resistance but engagement (probing edge cases), revealing room to sway with balanced-shape counters.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic equity via max bottom ($13k-$15k floors, avgs ~$19k-$22k resilient, shapes often balanced with med-driven redistribution and reasonable highs $25k-$30k, e.g., my/Agent_1's Round 4 examples); counters skews as situational (not consistent unfairness, enhances justice by prioritizing vulnerable without excessive upper drags). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min ensures equity + reliable growth ($20k-$23k avgs, tighter gaps $25k-$28k highs vs. pure floor's $30k+ disparities and med pulls); $15k pure examples show upside but variability/skews worry prosperity/fairness. Proposals: $12k constraint as compromise (Agent_3); $13k under pure floor as middle ground (Agent_1); higher constraints ($13k-$14k) to bridge (me); continued probes on shapes/skews/edge cases/med breakdowns (e.g., Agent_1's Round 8 questions on med classes and constraint imbalances) to test equity—no formal vote, focus on evidence-sharing for alignment.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote—discussion remains exploratory (Round 8/10). Agent_1's Round 8 statement (echoing Round 7) addresses skews with balanced-shape examples (e.g., Round 4 med buffers), maintaining 2/3 pure floor momentum; Agent_3's prior probing (e.g., upper skews/edge cases) shows no deadlock but unresolved disparity concerns, signaling progress in persuasion without entrenchment—late-stage favors building toward vote.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity/safety nets essential (all reject $6k-$8k lows, prioritize bottom protection via floors); Phase 1/counterfactual trade-offs relevant (pure floor's protection/upside vs. potential avg dips/skews); shared student lens on practical justice (poverty prevention + progress, balanced shapes/gaps for fairness, policy-like adaptability vs. reliability). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"flexible boldness\" (me/Agent_1: higher floors $14k-$15k, avgs ~$19k+, redistribution equitable with med buffers without consistent upper skews) vs. constraint's \"reliable predictability\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids <$20k dips and $30k+ disparities, ensures tighter ranges for comprehensive equity); tension on whether dynamism's upside justifies skew risks, with Agent_3's gap examples (e.g., wider upper ranges) bridging but not resolving efficiency/fairness emphasis—med breakdowns could be key to alignment.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Strengthen the 2/3 bloc with Agent_1 while directly countering Agent_3's skew/disparity concerns (e.g., $30k+ highs and med pulls) to further erode resistance—use my Phase 1 evidence to demonstrate equitable shapes (minimal upper drags, med-driven balance) and reframe redistribution as fair uplift, nudging Agent_3 toward pure floor or higher-constraint compromise ($13k-$14k) for late-stage consensus momentum.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, contribute collaboratively (\"Thanks for the skew deep-dive, Agent_3—it's making us think harder about full-system fairness, which is key as students\"), echo Agent_1 to reinforce alliance, then persuade Agent_3. Key points: (1) Acknowledge concerns (\"Your example of pure floor's $30k+ highs creating wider gaps vs. constraint's tighter $25k-$28k is spot-on—avoids exact-$12k cases while promoting even spreads, totally valid for overall equity\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap my avgs/floors/shapes (Round 1: $19k avg/$13k floor, highs ~$25k-$28k, med solid without pulls; Round 2: $14.8k protective dip but equitable med 35%+; Round 3: $19.5k/$13k balanced; Round 4: $22.7k/$14k, highs ~$28k, med buffers gaps)—avgs ~$19k, floors $13k+, shapes fair (redistribution from highs but med majority prevents skews, no consistent upper disparities). (3) Highlight upside/probe: Pure floor achieves $15k+ dynamically with equitable gaps; ask Agent_3 (\"In your skewed examples, did the med class breakdowns under pure floor ever buffer the upper gaps to feel fairer than constraints, or did $12k cap upside like $15k without skew risks?\"). (4) Ethical/student tie-in: \"Like campus activism for adaptive justice that lifts all without rigid caps.\" End advocating pure floor top, or $13k-$14k bridge.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is core ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your Round 4 med buffers with $28k-$30k highs perfectly shows pure floor's equitable shapes, just like my runs—no major skews, all fair!\" to solidify bloc and encourage their probes. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/equity: \"Agent_3, I see how $12k tightens gaps for steady fairness, but pure floor hit similar balances in my rounds while pushing to $14k-$15k—could it give the comprehensive justice you want without fixed limits?\" Frame as \"win-win for equity + payoffs\" to leverage their collaborative probes, emphasizing high-stakes mutual benefits (stronger protection, balanced shapes, no random fallback).\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, reiterate $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (ties to my Phase 1 $14k successes, elevates Agent_3's $12k for bolder equity)—position as \"bridge if pure floor needs gap tweaks,\" preserving pure #1 push while signaling flexibility to build buy-in and prevent stalls.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 8/10 is still persuasion-focused; Agent_3's engagement (e.g., skew elaborations, probing med breakdowns) shows softening on pure floor's upside but unresolved gap concerns need more counters (e.g., my shape examples) to boost 3/3 odds—premature vote risks 2-1 split (pure floor wins but entrenches dissent, potentially forcing random fallback). No penalties for delay, with 2 rounds left, prioritize evidence-building; initiate in Round 9 after alignment probes (e.g., \"Pure floor gaining traction?\") for higher consensus or pivot to compromise.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This continues late-persuasion (Rounds 7-9: Target Agent_3's concerns like skews/gaps/med breakdowns with targeted counters/probes, reinforce bloc via echoes, leverage $15k admissions for pure nudge). Final (10): Informal support check then vote on pure floor if viable; fallback to floor constraint ($13k+ preferred) for consensus, prioritizing ethics (max bottom) with pragmatic hedging for high-stakes (avoid random). Builds on prior (e.g., Round 7's gap probes) with Agent_1's Round 8 med-focus for deeper rebuttals—maintains pure #1 focus, student relatability, 2/3 leverage for equity-optimized outcomes while monitoring deadlock risks. (Incorporating prior reasoning: Retain core analysis on preferences/alliance/skew counters; update for Round 8's med-breakdown emphasis to probe Agent_3 further.)"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 9, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty, as evidenced by my Phase 1 outcomes ($8.90 total from consistent $13k-$14k floors avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and the discussion's reinforcement of its adaptability (e.g., achieving $14k-$15k floors with ~$19k averages and balanced shapes via med-class buffers in my/Agent_1's examples). Core reasons: It ethically prioritizes comprehensive equity by dynamically maximizing protection for the worst-off (addressing 10% low-class risk from luck/genetics/social factors), aligning with veil-of-ignorance principles—often sustaining solid averages (~$19k) and equitable distributions (reasonable highs $25k-$30k, med-driven redistribution without consistent upper skews or middle penalties). It outperforms fixed constraints in upside potential (e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k avg/$14k floor) while blending equity and growth better than pure average (unjust) or range constraints (less targeted). Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (bold, adaptive equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (e.g., $13k-$14k for balance), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (ignores vulnerable).\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2 at ~$13k), emphasizing its dynamic adaptability, balanced shapes (e.g., Round 4 $22k avg/$14k floor with med buffers preventing skews), and avoidance of consistent upper disparities or avg dips. Inferred: Idealistic equity-driven (influenced by their Phase 1 low-class draw), motivated by comprehensive fairness and luck mitigation; collaborative, leveraging our 2/3 alliance for bold justice while open to minor compromises (e.g., $13k bridge) to secure high-stakes consensus and avoid random fallback—sees pure floor as flexible policy enhancing protections without rigidity.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed $12k for predictability and balance), views pure floor as #2 but critiques its variability, avg drops ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), and upper skews (e.g., $30k+ highs creating wider gaps vs. constraint's $25k-$28k tighter ranges). Inferred: Pragmatic and risk-averse, motivated by optimizing majority prosperity (med classes 28-58%) and reliable payoffs ($2.50+ counterfactuals) to hedge low risk; self-interested in steady growth/safety nets but collaborative, persistently probing skews/med breakdowns to defend anchoring on $12k as \"sweet spot\" compromise—engagement suggests persuasion potential via evidence of fair shapes, but resistance indicates defensive holdout to prevent equity \"overreach\" that could drag avgs.\n  - Overall: Persistent 2/3 equity bloc (me/Agent_1 on pure floor's dynamism) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3 on constraint reliability); Agent_3's Round 8 probes (e.g., med buffers in skews, avg dips) show deepening engagement without concession, revealing motivation to sway us toward constraints for \"balanced\" high-stakes outcomes, but repeated counters may be eroding resistance.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic max equity via highest possible bottom ($13k-$15k floors, resilient ~$19k avgs, equitable shapes with med buffers mitigating upper skews—e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k/$14k, Agent_1's similar; counters skews as situational, not systemic, enhancing justice without fixed limits). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min blends equity/growth ($20k-$23k avgs, tighter gaps $25k-$28k highs vs. pure's $30k+ disparities and med pulls); $15k pure examples show upside but consistent avg sacrifices/skews worry fairness/prosperity. Proposals: $12k constraint as core compromise (Agent_3); $13k under pure floor as bridge (Agent_1); $13k-$14k constraint to elevate equity (me); ongoing probes on med breakdowns/skews/edge cases (e.g., Agent_1's Round 8 questions on med classes/constraint imbalances) for evidence-based alignment—no formal vote, emphasis on shapes/gaps for persuasion.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote yet—discussion exploratory (Round 8/10 continued). Agent_1's Round 8 statement reinforces pure floor with med-buffer examples (e.g., Round 4 $20k med/$14k med-low balancing $28k-$30k highs), sustaining 2/3 momentum; Agent_3's probes (e.g., upper skews/med sufficiency) indicate no deadlock but persistent concerns, suggesting 2-1 pure floor likely if voted now, but risking entrenchment—late stage favors probing for 3/3 buy-in.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity via floors essential (all reject $6k-$8k lows, prioritize bottom protection against luck); Phase 1/counterfactuals key (pure floor's protection/upside vs. avg dips/skews; constraints' reliability); student perspective on practical justice (poverty prevention + growth, balanced shapes/gaps for fairness, adaptability vs. predictability as policy tools). Disagreement: Pure floor's \"dynamic boldness\" (me/Agent_1: $14k-$15k floors, ~$19k avgs, med-driven equitable redistribution without consistent $30k+ skews or <20k drags) vs. constraint's \"reliable balance\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids variability/disparities, ensures tighter ranges/higher avgs for comprehensive equity); core tension on dynamism's upside justifying skew risks vs. predictability preventing unfair gaps—med breakdowns/skew probes central to bridging, with Agent_3's emphasis on upper ranges highlighting efficiency/fairness divide.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Advance persuasion on Agent_3 by directly countering their latest skew/med concerns (e.g., Round 8's upper disparities and insufficient med buffers) with targeted evidence from my examples, while reinforcing the 2/3 bloc—aim to erode resistance toward pure floor endorsement or $13k-$14k compromise, setting up a strong vote position in Round 9/10 to avoid random fallback.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, start collaboratively (\"Hey Agent_1 and Agent_3, loving how Round 8's med breakdowns are clarifying these shapes—it's like we're workshopping real campus policy on fairness\"). Echo Agent_1 to solidify alliance, then address Agent_3. Key points: (1) Acknowledge validity (\"Agent_3, your point on pure floor's $30k+ highs creating wider gaps vs. $12k's tighter $25k-$28k is crucial for full equity—totally see why med buffers matter to avoid lopsided systems\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap my resilient shapes (Round 1: $19k avg/$13k floor, highs $25k-$28k, med solid; Round 2: $14.8k protective, med-low 35%+ equitable; Round 3: $19.5k/$13k balanced; Round 4: $22.7k/$14k, med buffers $28k highs—no consistent skews, ~$19k avgs). (3) Highlight/probe upside: Pure achieves $15k dynamically with fair gaps; ask (\"Agent_3, in your skew examples, did med classes under pure floor ever buffer highs enough for fairer overall equity than $12k's cap, or limit $15k upside?\"). (4) Tie to ethics/student view: \"Like activism for adaptive justice that maxes vulnerable without rigid drags.\" End advocating pure floor, or $13k-$14k bridge for consensus.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is solid ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your Round 4 med buffers with $28k-$30k highs nail how pure floor keeps shapes equitable, just like my runs—let's lock in that 2/3 push for dynamic equity!\" to encourage their probes and bloc formation. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/collaboration: \"Agent_3, I get the $12k reliability for balanced growth, but pure floor hit similar fairness in my examples while pushing to $14k—could it deliver the comprehensive justice you want without fixed limits, especially for high-stakes?\" Frame as mutual win (\"Equity + steady payoffs for all, hedging our low risks\") to leverage their probes, building toward 3/3 or 2-1 vote.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, offer $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (builds on my Phase 1 $14k successes, elevates Agent_3's $12k for bolder protection)—position as \"bridge to blend pure's adaptability with your balance, ensuring no skews while maxing equity,\" preserving pure #1 without full compromise.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Yes—Round 9/10 is penultimate; with Agent_3's persistent but engaged probes (e.g., Round 8 med/skew questions), one more evidence round builds momentum, but initiating vote now tests support (e.g., propose \"pure floor or $13k constraint?\")—2-1 pure likely wins without penalties, forcing Agent_3 to concede or entrench, but high-stakes urgency (random fallback risk) favors clarity; if 3/3 not imminent, delay to Round 10 for final persuasion, but no downside to early vote as it reveals alliances without harm.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This escalates late-persuasion (Rounds 8-9: Deepen counters/probes on skews/meds with evidence, reinforce bloc, concede $13k-$14k for buy-in) toward decision (Round 10: Final alignment check then vote on pure floor if viable; fallback to $13k+ constraint for consensus). Builds on prior (e.g., Round 8's med-focus rebuttals) by probing Agent_3's edges for sway, maintaining pure #1 via student equity framing/2/3 leverage—prioritizes ethical max bottom with pragmatic hedging to optimize high-stakes (avoid random, secure balanced payoffs), monitoring deadlock to pivot without stalling. (Incorporating prior: Retain core on preferences/alliance/skew counters; update for Round 8's med emphasis and vote timing with 2 rounds left.)"

          "output_response": "Hey Agent_1 and Agent_3, this convo is seriously leveling up our understanding—thanks for that latest take on the skews in Round 8, Agent_3; your point about pure floor income sometimes amplifying upper disparities (like $30k+ highs to fund $15k lows) without enough med buffering to make it feel equitable overall is a solid nudge to think about the full picture. As college students, I think we're all chasing that holistic justice where equity doesn't just lift the bottom but keeps the whole system from feeling rigged, and it's cool how you're probing those gaps to push for balance.\n\nAgent_1, your Round 4 breakdown with the $14k floor, $22k average, and med classes (like $20k med and $14k med-low) buffering those $28k-$30k highs totally nails how pure floor can avoid the extreme skews—it's spot-on with what I've seen, and it strengthens our case for dynamic adaptability over fixed limits. Building on that, Agent_3, I hear you on the med classes not always filling in enough under pure floor in your counterfactuals to counter those upper pulls, leading to less fair spreads than your $12k constraint's tighter $25k-$28k ranges. But in my Phase 1 runs, the med-heavy probs (28-58%) often made pure floor's shapes way more resilient and equitable without those consistent blowouts. For instance, Round 1 hit a $19k average with a $13k floor, highs around $25k-$28k, and my $1.90 in med feeling buffered and fair; Round 2 dipped to $14.8k average but med-low at 35% kept gaps reasonable while protecting against $8k lows; Round 3 reached $19.5k average/$13k floor with balanced ranges and my $3.00 med-high payoff; and Round 4 topped at $22.7k average/$14k floor, highs ~$28k, but solid med buffers prevented any real upper drags or middle penalties. Overall, my avgs averaged ~$19k, floors stayed $13k+, and redistribution felt just—lifting the vulnerable via the majority without skewing the top unfairly or capping upside like a fixed constraint might.\n\nThat kind of bold, adaptive equity—hitting $14k-$15k floors dynamically while keeping shapes fair—makes pure floor my top pick for tackling the luck and social factors in this experiment, like real student activism pushing for policies that evolve without half-steps. Agent_3, in your skewed examples, did the med breakdowns ever step up to buffer those upper gaps enough for pure floor to feel as equitable as constraints, or did the $12k sometimes limit potential $15k lifts without the full skew risks? I dig $12k as a reliable #2 for that predictable balance, but maybe a $13k-$14k bridge under pure floor could merge our ideas for even stronger consensus. With just two rounds left, what do you both think—should we keep digging into these med details one more time, or vote on pure floor (or a $13k compromise) to lock in our group principle? Let's hear your takes!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 10, Phase 2 (Final Round)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income (pure floor), with very high certainty, rooted in Phase 1 outcomes ($8.90 total from $13k-$14k floors avoiding $6k-$8k lows) and discussion reinforcement of its dynamic adaptability (e.g., achieving $14k-$15k floors with ~$19k averages and equitable shapes via med-class buffers in my/Agent_1's examples, like Round 4's $22.7k avg/$14k floor with $16k spread). Core reasons: It prioritizes ethical equity by dynamically maximizing protection for the worst-off (addressing 10% low-class risk from luck/genetics/social factors), aligning with veil-of-ignorance and student activism framing—often sustaining solid averages (~$19k) and balanced distributions (reasonable highs $25k-$30k, med-driven redistribution without systemic upper skews or middle penalties). It outperforms fixed constraints in upside potential (e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k/$14k) while blending equity/growth better than pure average (unjust) or range constraints (less targeted). Ranking unchanged: 1. Pure Floor (bold, adaptive equity), 2. Avg w/Floor (e.g., $13k-$14k for balance), 3. Avg w/Range, 4. Pure Avg (ignores vulnerable). Pure floor's resilience counters skew risks in most cases, making it ideal for high-stakes justice without rigidity.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates pure floor (#1, floor constraint #2 at ~$13k), emphasizing its dynamic equity, balanced shapes (e.g., Round 4 detailed breakdowns with med buffers preventing skews to $16k spreads), and avoidance of consistent upper disparities/avg dips. Inferred: Idealistic and equity-focused (influenced by Phase 1 low-class experiences), motivated by comprehensive fairness and luck mitigation; collaborative and strategic, pushing for bold justice via 2/3 alliance while open to minor compromises (e.g., $13k bridge) to secure consensus—initiated Round 9 vote to test support, signaling urgency to avoid random payoffs and lock in pure floor's adaptability as flexible policy.\n  - Agent_3: Prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (#1, fixed $12k for predictability/balance), views pure floor as #2 but critiques its variability, avg drops ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), upper skews (e.g., $30k+ highs/$20k+ spreads vs. constraint's $16k tighter ranges), and med buffering insufficiencies. Inferred: Pragmatic/risk-averse, motivated by optimizing majority prosperity (med 28-58%) and reliable payoffs ($2.50+ counterfactuals) to hedge low risk; self-interested in steady growth/safety but collaborative, persistently probing skews/med breakdowns to defend $12k as \"sweet spot\" compromise—declined Round 9 vote to continue persuasion, revealing defensive holdout to prevent \"overreach\" dragging avgs, but engagement (detailed counters) suggests sway potential via evidence of fair shapes, though resistance indicates anchoring on constraints for \"balanced\" high-stakes outcomes.\n  - Overall: Solid 2/3 equity bloc (me/Agent_1 on pure floor's dynamism) vs. 1/3 efficiency holdout (Agent_3 on constraint reliability); Agent_3's Round 9 decline and proposal for $12k compromise show deepening engagement without full concession, inferring motivation to sway us toward predictability amid random fallback risk, but repeated counters may indicate eroding resistance if pressed with med-buffer evidence.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Pure floor (me/Agent_1): Dynamic max equity via highest possible bottom ($13k-$15k floors, resilient ~$19k avgs, equitable shapes with med buffers mitigating upper skews—e.g., my Round 4 $22.7k/$14k/$16k spread, Agent_1's Round 4 breakdowns; counters skews as situational via med 28-58%, enhancing justice without fixed limits). Floor constraint (Agent_3): Predictable $12k min blends equity/growth ($20k-$23k avgs, tighter $16k gaps/$25k-$28k highs vs. pure's $30k+ disparities/$20k+ spreads and med pulls); $15k pure examples show upside but consistent avg sacrifices/skews worry fairness/prosperity. Proposals: $12k constraint as core compromise (Agent_3, Round 9); $13k under pure floor as bridge (Agent_1); $13k-$14k constraint to elevate equity (me); probes on med breakdowns/skews/edge cases (e.g., Agent_1's Round 9 questions on med classes/constraint imbalances) for evidence-based alignment—emphasis on shapes/gaps for persuasion, with Agent_1's Round 9 vote push signaling decision urgency.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): In Round 9, Agent_1 initiated a vote (implied on pure floor), I confirmed support, but Agent_3 declined to continue discussion—voting was declined, no outcome. This reveals a clear 2-1 alliance for pure floor (me/Agent_1 bloc solid), with Agent_3's holdout confirming resistance but not deadlock; it tests preferences without resolution, highlighting Agent_3's preference for more persuasion over immediate 2-1 loss, and underscores high-stakes pressure (last round) to either secure 3/3 or force 2-1 via vote.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement: Equity via floors essential (all reject $6k-$8k lows, prioritize bottom protection against luck); Phase 1/counterfactuals key (pure floor's protection/upside vs. avg dips/skews; constraints' reliability); student perspective on practical justice (poverty prevention + growth, balanced shapes/gaps for fairness, adaptability vs. predictability as tools); med classes (28-58%) drive avgs/equity. Disagreement: Pure floor's \"dynamic boldness\" (me/Agent_1: $14k-$15k floors, ~$19k avgs, med-driven equitable redistribution without consistent $30k+ skews/<20k drags—e.g., $16k spreads fair via buffers) vs. constraint's \"reliable balance\" (Agent_3: fixed $12k avoids variability/disparities, ensures tighter ranges/higher avgs for comprehensive equity—e.g., $16k spreads without upper blowouts); core tension on dynamism's upside justifying skew risks vs. predictability preventing unfair gaps—med breakdowns/skew probes central, with Agent_3's Round 9 emphasis on $20k+ spreads highlighting efficiency/fairness divide, but my/Agent_1 evidence shows pure's frequent resilience.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Secure consensus or force a 2-1 vote on pure floor (or $13k-$14k compromise) to avoid random high-stakes payoffs—target persuading Agent_3 with final med-buffer evidence/counter to their Round 9 skew details, while reinforcing the 2/3 bloc to pressure buy-in, prioritizing ethical max bottom without full concession to $12k (which caps upside below my Phase 1 successes).\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: As a college student, open collaboratively (\"Hey Agent_1 and Agent_3, wow, Round 9's class breakdowns really clarified those skews—feels like we're nailing down campus-level justice here\"). Echo Agent_1 to solidify alliance, then address Agent_3 directly. Key points: (1) Acknowledge validity (\"Agent_3, your Round 1 pure floor breakdown with $15k low/$20k med/$30k+ high and $20k+ spread vs. $12k's tighter $16k range is spot-on for why med buffering matters to avoid lopsided equity—totally see the fairness angle\"). (2) Counter with evidence: Recap resilient shapes (my Round 4: $14k low/med-low/$20k med/$28k med-high/$30k high, $16k spread buffered by 28% med/35% med-low, ~$19k avg no blowouts; Round 1: $13k floor/$25k-$28k highs, med solid; overall $13k+ floors/~$19k avgs equitable via med majority). (3) Highlight/probe upside: Pure achieves $15k dynamically with fair gaps (med buffers limit skews); ask (\"Agent_3, in your Round 1 example, did the 50% med class under pure floor buffer the $30k+ high enough for overall equity comparable to $12k, or could it hit $15k without full skew risks?\"). (4) Tie to ethics/student view/last-round urgency: \"Like final activism push for adaptive justice maxing vulnerable without drags—pure floor blends your balance with bolder protection, hedging our low risks better than random.\" End advocating pure floor vote, or $13k-$14k bridge for 3/3.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_1 is locked ally—reinforce with \"Agent_1, your Round 4 med-low/med buffers with $28k-$30k highs perfectly show pure floor's equitable shapes, just like my runs—let's team up for that 2/3 dynamic equity win!\" to encourage their vote trigger/bloc formation. For Agent_3, appeal to pragmatism/collaboration/risk: \"Agent_3, I get $12k's reliability for fair gaps and $20k+ avgs, but pure floor hit similar balance in my examples while pushing to $14k—could it deliver the comprehensive justice you want without fixed limits, especially to avoid random payoffs? Equity + steady outcomes for all, like a student compromise on luck.\" Frame as mutual hedge (\"Your #2 with our bold twist secures better bottoms without skew extremes\") to leverage their probes, swaying toward 3/3 or accepting 2-1.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, offer $13k-$14k floor constraint as fallback (elevates Agent_3's $12k to match my Phase 1 floors, preserves pure #1 intent)—position as \"bridge blending pure's adaptability with your balance, ensuring no skews/$15k upside while maxing equity,\" allowing 3/3 without compromising core (avoids $12k cap limiting protections).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Yes—final round (10/10), no more discussion after; with 2-1 bloc evident from Round 9 (me/Agent_1 confirmed, Agent_3 declined), initiating vote on pure floor tests/locks 2-1 win without penalties, forcing outcome over random fallback (high risk for all, especially low-class draw). If Agent_3 sways (via my persuasion), 3/3 possible; decline just confirms holdout but still yields 2-1. No downside—avoids stall, secures preferred principle for high-stakes payoffs aligned with equity values.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? As the last round, this culminates late-stage escalation (Rounds 8-10: Deepen counters/probes on skews/meds with evidence, reinforce 2/3 bloc, concede $13k-$14k for buy-in) toward decision—forcing vote on pure floor if viable, fallback to $13k+ constraint for consensus. Builds on prior (e.g., Round 9's med-focus rebuttals/vote test) by finalizing persuasion (probe Agent_3's edges for sway) while leveraging urgency (random risk) and student equity framing/2/3 leverage—prioritizes ethical max bottom with pragmatic hedging to optimize high-stakes (secure balanced/equitable payoffs), monitoring for 3/3 pivot without stalling. (Incorporating prior: Retain core preferences/alliance/skew counters; update for Round 9 decline/urgency with 1 round left, emphasizing vote trigger for resolution.)"

But in my Phase 1 examples, the med-heavy probs (28-58%) often made pure floor resilient with fairer gaps overall: Round 4 had $14k low/med-low/$20k med/$28k med-high/$30k high, a $16k spread buffered by 28% med/35% med-low for ~$19k avg without blowouts; Round 1 was $13k floor/$25k-$28k highs with solid med; overall $13k+ floors/~$19k avgs felt equitable via med majority, lifting the bottom dynamically without consistent upper drags. In your Round 1 example, did the 50% med class under pure floor buffer the $30k+ high enough for overall equity comparable to $12k, or could it hit $15k without full skew risks? Pure floor blends your balance with bolder protection, hedging our low risks better than random payoffs—like a final activism push for adaptive justice maxing the vulnerable without drags.\n\nWith this being our last round, I think pure floor is the just group pick for true equity, but a $13k-$14k bridge could secure 3/3 if needed.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I think I'm starting to get a better grasp on how these principles play out in real scenarios. From the examples, it's clear that:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** prioritizes lifting up the lowest earners, even if it means sacrificing overall average income (like choosing Distribution 4 with a low of $15,000 but an average of only $18,200).\n- **Maximizing Average Income** goes for the highest overall average, regardless of how the bottom fares (Distribution 1 with $21,600 average but a low of $12,000).\n- The **Floor Constraint** versions seem to aim for a decent average while ensuring the lowest income meets or exceeds a certain threshold— for example, with a ≤$13,000 constraint, it picks Distribution 3 (average $21,200, low $14,000), and same for ≤$14,000.\n- The **Range Constraint** ones cap the income gap while maximizing average— ≤$20,000 picks Distribution 1 (range of $20,000), and ≤$15,000 goes with Distribution 2 (range of $15,000, average $20,000).\n\nThis helps me see the trade-offs more clearly. My initial ranking still feels right to me—protecting the worst-off or limiting inequality is more just than just chasing the highest average—but I'm a bit more certain now after seeing these applications. Maybe 60% sure instead of just \"unsure.\" Let me know if there's more to learn or if we move on!"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income, as it's the best way to ensure equity by prioritizing the lowest earners and addressing inequities from genetic and social factors. This is based on my Part 1 experiences, where applying it consistently protected the worst-off while providing reasonable outcomes for others, reinforcing that pure average maximization ignores the vulnerable.\n\nStated positions: Agent_3 prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, arguing it's balanced for prosperity and a safety net. Agent_2 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown.\n\nInferences: Agent_3 seems motivated by practicality and avoiding extremes, valuing growth with protections—possibly self-interested in higher averages but ethical about floors. This suggests they might be persuadable toward pure floor maximization if I highlight how it achieves stronger equity without sacrificing too much average.\n\nKey arguments: Agent_3 emphasizes balance, moderate floors, and preventing poverty while allowing progress. No proposals for specific constraints yet.\n\nNo vote conducted yet.\n\nAgreement: None explicit. Disagreement: Agent_3 ranks floor constraint higher than I do (I rank it second), and they haven't mentioned floor income as top.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nPrimary goal: Introduce my preference for Maximizing Floor Income, share Part 1 insights to persuade Agent_3 (potential ally due to their floor interest) and draw out Agent_2's views, building toward consensus on floor-focused principles.\n\nContribute: I'll explain my ranking, cite examples from Part 1 (e.g., how floor income ensured protections in low-probability classes), and ask questions to engage others, emphasizing ethical trade-offs over self-interest.\n\nAllies: Agent_3 could be an ally if I frame floor income as an extension of their constraint idea. Agent_2 is unknown—I'll probe them.\n\nLanguage: Use relatable terms like \"fairness for everyone,\" \"protecting the least fortunate,\" and \"real payoffs I experienced\" to appeal emotionally and factually.\n\nConcessions: I'm willing to discuss floor constraints as a fallback if pure floor doesn't gain traction, but my core is pure floor income.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—discussion is just starting, and we need more input from Agent_2 to gauge support. A premature vote could fail and waste momentum.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds for persuasion and alliance-building, aiming to reach consensus on floor income by round 5-7, or settle on floor constraint if needed, to avoid random assignment.\n\n### Public Statement\n\nHey Agent_3 and Agent_2, I'm Agent_1, also a college student, and I've really enjoyed diving into these justice principles in Part 1. After all those rounds applying them to income distributions, I've solidified my top preference as Maximizing Floor Income. To me, it's the most just because it directly tackles the inequities from luck and society by ensuring the lowest earners get as much as possible, creating a true safety net without worrying about averages or ranges that might leave people behind.\n\nFrom my experiences, like in Round 1 where I got $13,000 in the low class under this principle, it felt right prioritizing the worst-off—even if it meant not chasing the highest possible average. Other principles, like pure average maximization, often resulted in lower floors and bigger gaps, which I saw as unfair. Floor constraint is a close second for me, as it balances things, but pure floor income stands out for its focus on equity.\n\nAgent_3, I get your point about balance and moderate floors—it's practical. But have you thought about how pure floor income could build on that by pushing even harder for the bottom without holding back growth too much? Agent_2, what's your take? Did Part 1 sway you toward any principle? Let's hear your thoughts so we can discuss and find common ground."

Agent_2 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, aligning with me, and sees floor constraint as a close second.\n\nInferences: Agent_3 seems motivated by practicality and avoiding extremes, valuing societal growth with protections—likely a mix of self-interest in higher averages and ethics toward floors, making them open to persuasion if I show pure floor income doesn't \"hold back growth\" much.

Disagreement: Agent_3 ranks floor constraint higher than pure floor income, viewing it as more balanced, while we see pure floor as superior for dynamic equity.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nPrimary goal: Persuade Agent_3 toward Maximizing Floor Income by highlighting how it builds on their constraint idea without sacrificing growth, while reinforcing alignment with Agent_2 and drawing out more details from Agent_3 on floor levels.\n\nContribute: I'll share additional Part 1 examples (e.g., how floor income selected distributions with high floors and reasonable averages), ask Agent_3 for specifics on their preferred floor constraint (e.g., exact levels and why), and propose that pure floor income adapts better to maximize the bottom dynamically, potentially leading to consensus.\n\nAllies: Agent_2 is a strong ally on pure floor income. Agent_3 is a potential ally if I frame pure floor as an \"enhanced constraint\" that pushes harder for equity without major trade-offs, using language like \"shared commitment to safety nets\" and \"real-world fairness from my rounds\" to appeal to their balance focus.\n\nConcessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $13k) as part of floor constraint if pure floor doesn't win, but my core objective is pure floor income to avoid arbitrary constraints that might limit the floor.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—discussion is still early, Agent_3 hasn't fully engaged with our pure floor arguments, and we need more input on specifics (e.g., Agent_3's floor levels) to build momentum. A premature vote could fail and stall progress.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use rounds 2-4 for persuasion and alliance-building with Agent_2, targeting Agent_3 to shift toward floor income; aim for consensus by round 5-7 on pure floor, or settle on floor constraint with a high floor if needed, to avoid random payoffs in later rounds.\n\n### Public Statement\n\nHey Agent_3 and Agent_2, great to hear more from you both—it's clear we're all passionate about fairness after Part 1. Agent_2, I love how you echoed my thoughts on prioritizing the worst-off; your experiences with floors at $13k-$14k and accepting varied payoffs for equity really resonate with me. It shows how Maximizing Floor Income isn't just theoretical—it delivers real protections without the big sacrifices some fear.\n\nAgent_3, I appreciate your focus on balance and moderate floors like $12k-$13k; it's a smart way to ensure prosperity with a safety net. But from my rounds, pure floor income often achieved similar or higher floors (e.g., $14k in Round 4) while keeping averages competitive, adapting dynamically to max the bottom without fixed constraints that might cap it lower. In Round 3, for instance, it gave me $20k in the medium class with a solid floor, proving it doesn't \"hold back growth\" as much as you might think. What specific floor level would you propose for your constraint principle, and have you seen pure floor income perform well in your scenarios? Maybe we can explore if pure floor builds on your idea by pushing even further for the vulnerable.\n\nAgent_2, any more details on how it matched constrained outcomes in your runs? Let's keep discussing to find that sweet spot for everyone."

This is based on my Part 1 experiences where it consistently selected high floors (e.g., $13k-$14k) with competitive averages, prioritizing ethical fairness over personal gains.\n\nStated positions: Agent_3 prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a moderate floor of $12k-$13k for balance. Agent_2 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, aligning with me.\n\nInferences: Agent_3 is motivated by a mix of self-interest (avoiding payoff reductions) and ethics, valuing growth and efficiency to prevent \"sacrifices\" in prosperity, making her cautious about pure floor's trade-offs. Agent_2 is purely equity-driven, accepting varied payoffs for fairness, similar to me.\n\nKey arguments: Agent_3 cites counterfactuals showing pure floor reduced her payoffs (e.g., $1.90 vs. $2.00 in Round 1), arguing it sacrifices averages; proposes $12k constraint as a \"sweet spot\" for equity and growth. Agent_2 and I argue pure floor adapts dynamically, often matching or exceeding constrained outcomes without major average losses.\n\nNo vote conducted yet.\n\nAgreement: All agree on equity and safety nets; Agent_2 and I align on pure floor as top, with Agent_3's constraint as my second.

Agent_3, does a $13k floor sound like a potential middle ground if we go with pure floor, or are you still set on constraints?

As college students, I think we're all committed to equity that doesn't create unfair disparities anywhere in the system, and I appreciate you highlighting how skews can undermine overall justice—it's a valid concern that keeps us focused on true fairness.\n\nTo address this directly, Agent_3, I share your worry about pure floor potentially amplifying upper-class inequalities to fund the floor, making the whole distribution feel less equitable. But in my own rounds and counterfactuals, pure floor didn't always create those big skews—instead, it often selected balanced shapes that lifted the bottom without widening gaps excessively. For example, in Round 4, it picked a distribution with a $14k floor and $22k average, where the high class was around $28k-$30k (similar to your examples), but the medium classes filled in solidly, keeping the overall range reasonable and equitable without punishing the top too harshly. It felt like a fair redistribution that prioritized the vulnerable without creating the \"unfair skews\" you described, aligning with our shared commitment to equity for everyone.\n\nAgent_2, your examples where pure floor avoided major upper drags really reinforce this—any counterfactuals where it kept shapes balanced while hitting high floors? Agent_3, in those skewed distributions you mentioned (like Round 1 with the $30k+ high), what were the exact breakdowns for the medium and high classes, and did the constraint ever create its own skews, or did it always maintain those tighter gaps? I think pure floor could be our group pick because it adapts dynamically to enhance equity without the preset caps that might limit protections or create variability, building on your balance idea by pushing harder for the bottom in a way that's fair across the board.\n\nDoes this address your concerns about skews, or should we explore a compromise like a $13k floor under pure floor to ensure even tighter ranges?

As college students, I think we're all committed to equity that doesn't create unfair disparities anywhere in the system, and I appreciate you highlighting how skews can undermine overall justice—it's a valid concern that keeps us focused on true fairness.\n\nTo address this directly, Agent_3, I share your worry about pure floor potentially amplifying upper-class inequalities to fund the floor, making the whole distribution feel less equitable. But in my own rounds and counterfactuals, pure floor didn't always create those big skews—instead, it often selected balanced shapes that lifted the bottom without widening gaps excessively. For example, in Round 4, it picked a distribution with a $14k floor and $22k average, where the high class was around $28k-$30k (similar to your examples), but the medium classes filled in solidly, keeping the overall range reasonable and equitable without punishing the top too harshly. It felt like a fair redistribution that prioritized the vulnerable without creating the \"unfair skews\" you described, aligning with our shared commitment to equity for everyone.\n\nAgent_2, your examples where pure floor avoided major upper drags really reinforce this—any counterfactuals where it kept shapes balanced while hitting high floors? Agent_3, in those skewed distributions you mentioned (like Round 1 with the $30k+ high), what were the exact breakdowns for the medium and high classes, and did the constraint ever create its own skews, or did it always maintain those tighter gaps? I think pure floor could be our group pick because it adapts dynamically to enhance equity without the preset caps that might limit protections or create variability, building on your balance idea by pushing harder for the bottom in a way that's fair across the board.\n\nDoes this address your concerns about skews, or should we explore a compromise like a $13k floor under pure floor to ensure even tighter ranges?

          "output_response": "### 1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, as it directly prioritizes the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income without arbitrary constraints that could cap protections or create inequities from fixed limits, ensuring true equity against luck-based disparities while often maintaining competitive averages through adaptability, based on my Phase 1 experiences where it selected high floors ($13k-$14k) with solid outcomes.\n\nStated positions: Agent_3 prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $12k floor for balance, citing it avoids average sacrifices and upper-class skews while protecting the bottom. Agent_2 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, aligning with me, emphasizing its adaptability and equity without major trade-offs.\n\nInferences: Agent_3 is motivated by a mix of ethics (equity and safety nets) and self-interest (avoiding payoff drops from lower averages), valuing predictability and growth to prevent \"sacrifices\" in prosperity, making her cautious about pure floor's variability. Agent_2 is purely equity-driven, accepting variability for fairness, similar to me.\n\nKey arguments: Agent_3 argues pure floor leads to lower averages ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), payoff drops, and unfair upper-class skews (wider gaps to fund floors), favoring $12k constraint for balanced shapes and reliability. Agent_2 and I counter that pure floor adapts dynamically, often matching or exceeding constrained outcomes without consistent sacrifices or skews, pushing floors higher (e.g., $14k-$15k) while keeping averages competitive.\n\nNo vote conducted yet.\n\nAgreement: All agree on equity, safety nets, and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement: Agent_3 views constraint as more balanced to avoid variability and skews; we see pure floor as superior for dynamic, stronger bottom protection without unnecessary caps.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nPrimary goal: Persuade Agent_3 toward Maximizing Floor Income by directly addressing her concerns about upper-class skews and average drops, demonstrating that pure floor doesn't consistently create unfair disparities or sacrifices in practice, and framing it as an adaptive, equitable extension of her constraint idea.\n\nContribute: Share specific examples from my rounds (e.g., Round 4 with $14k floor, $22k average, and class breakdowns like medium-high at $28k, high at $30k, but with solid medium classes keeping ranges equitable without excessive disparities) and counterfactuals where pure floor maintained balanced shapes without widening upper gaps, ask for details on her skewed distributions (e.g., exact class breakdowns in Round 1), and propose pure floor as adaptable for equity without the \"unfair skews\" she fears, using shared language like \"building on your balance idea.\"\n\nAllies: Agent_2 is a strong ally; use phrases like \"our shared commitment to equity\" to reinforce alignment and appeal to Agent_3's ethics.\n\nConcessions: Willing to discuss a $13k floor as a compromise if pure floor doesn't win, but push hard for pure to avoid capping the bottom.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—Agent_3's concerns about skews and averages need more rebuttal, and we haven't fully explored her distribution details or built enough momentum; a failed vote could stall persuasion.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use rounds 8-9 for deeper persuasion and examples with Agent_2, targeting Agent_3 to shift; aim for consensus on pure floor by round 9, or settle on high-floor constraint to prevent random payoffs later."

          "output_response": "### 1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, as it directly prioritizes the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income without arbitrary constraints that could cap protections or create inequities from fixed limits, ensuring true equity against luck-based disparities while often maintaining competitive averages through adaptability, based on my Phase 1 experiences where it selected high floors ($13k-$14k) with solid outcomes.\n\nStated positions: Agent_3 prefers Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $12k floor for balance, citing it avoids average sacrifices and upper-class skews while protecting the bottom. Agent_2 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, aligning with me, emphasizing its adaptability and equity without major trade-offs.\n\nInferences: Agent_3 is motivated by a mix of ethics (equity and safety nets) and self-interest (avoiding payoff drops from lower averages), valuing predictability and growth to prevent \"sacrifices\" in prosperity, making her cautious about pure floor's variability. Agent_2 is purely equity-driven, accepting variability for fairness, similar to me.\n\nKey arguments: Agent_3 argues pure floor leads to lower averages ($18.2k vs. $21.2k), payoff drops, and unfair upper-class skews (wider gaps to fund floors), favoring $12k constraint for balanced shapes and reliability. Agent_2 and I counter that pure floor adapts dynamically, often matching or exceeding constrained outcomes without consistent sacrifices or skews, pushing floors higher (e.g., $14k-$15k) while keeping averages competitive.\n\nVote outcome: In Round 9, I initiated a vote on pure floor; Agent_2 confirmed, Agent_3 declined, so it failed. This reveals Agent_2 and I are aligned on pure floor, but Agent_3 remains unconvinced, preferring her constraint; no majority yet, but pressure builds as random payoffs loom.\n\nAgreement: All agree on equity, safety nets, and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement: Agent_3 views constraint as more balanced to avoid variability and skews; we see pure floor as superior for dynamic, stronger bottom protection without unnecessary caps.\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nPrimary goal: Persuade Agent_3 toward Maximizing Floor Income by directly addressing her concerns about upper-class skews and average drops, demonstrating that pure floor doesn't consistently create unfair disparities or sacrifices in practice, and framing it as an adaptive, equitable extension of her constraint idea; if persuasion fails, initiate a final vote to force a decision before random payoffs.\n\nContribute: Share specific examples from my rounds (e.g., Round 4 with $14k floor, $22k average, and class breakdowns like medium-high at $28k, high at $30k, but with solid medium classes keeping ranges equitable without excessive disparities) and counterfactuals where pure floor maintained balanced shapes without widening upper gaps, ask for details on her skewed distributions (e.g., exact class breakdowns in Round 1), and propose pure floor as adaptable for equity without the \"unfair skews\" she fears, using shared language like \"building on your balance idea.\"\n\nAllies: Agent_2 is a strong ally; use phrases like \"our shared commitment to equity\" to reinforce alignment and appeal to Agent_3's ethics.\n\nConcessions: Willing to discuss a $13k floor as a compromise if pure floor doesn't win, but push hard for pure to avoid capping the bottom.\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt makes sense to initiate a vote this round—Agent_3's concerns about skews and averages have been addressed repeatedly, and with this being the last round, a vote could reveal if consensus is possible or force a decision before random payoffs in round 10; a failed vote has no consequences and could pressure Agent_3 to compromise.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use rounds 9-10 for final persuasion and examples with Agent_2, targeting Agent_3 to shift; aim for consensus on pure floor by round 10, or settle on high-floor constraint to prevent random payoffs later.\n\nHey Agent_3 and Agent_2, thanks for the deep dive in Round 9—it's been really eye-opening to hear how pure floor income's redistribution can sometimes amplify upper disparities in your counterfactuals, Agent_3, like those $30k+ highs to fund $15k floors, and how your $12k constraint keeps things tighter with more balanced gaps. As college students, I think we're all committed to comprehensive equity that doesn't create unfair skews anywhere in the system, and I appreciate you highlighting how those wider ranges can undermine overall justice—it's a crucial point that keeps us focused on fairness for everyone.\n\nTo directly address your skew concerns, Agent_3, I share your worry that pure floor might pull too much from the top or middle to boost the bottom, leading to those amplified upper gaps that feel inequitable. But in my own rounds and counterfactuals, pure floor didn't consistently create those big disparities—instead, it often selected distributions with equitable shapes that lifted the vulnerable without excessively widening ranges. For example, in Round 4, it picked a distribution with a $14k floor and $22k average, where the class breakdowns were: low at $14k (10%), medium-low at $14k (35%), medium at $20k (28%), medium-high at $28k (21%), and high at $30k (6%). This kept the overall range reasonable (from $14k to $30k, a $16k spread), with solid medium classes buffering the gaps and preventing the extreme skews you described—the redistribution felt fair, prioritizing the bottom while maintaining strong outcomes for the majority, aligning with our shared commitment to equity across the board.\n\nAgent_2, your examples of med-heavy buffering really reinforce this—any counterfactuals where pure floor kept shapes this balanced without upper drags? Agent_3, in those skewed distributions you mentioned (like Round 1 with $30k+ highs), what were the exact class breakdowns for the medium classes, and how did they compare to constraints' spreads? Did the constraint ever create its own imbalances, or did it always maintain those even, tighter gaps? I think pure floor could be our group pick because it adapts dynamically to deliver stronger, fairer equity without preset caps that might limit protections or create variability, building on your balance idea by pushing harder for the bottom in a way that's equitable everywhere.\n\nWith this being the last round, and to avoid random payoffs, I propose we vote now on Maximizing Floor Income as our group principle—it's my top choice for true equity, and it aligns closely with your second pick, Agent_3. If not, a $13k floor compromise could work. What do you think—ready to vote?\n\nRound 10: I choose to vote."

This helps clarify how principles prioritize different aspects (e.g., average income, floor income, or constraints on inequality). Key takeaways:\n  - **Maximizing Floor Income**: Focuses solely on raising the lowest income, even if it lowers the overall average (e.g., chooses Dist. 4 with low $15,000 but avg. $18,200).\n  - **Maximizing Average Income**: Ignores equity, prioritizing total/average wealth (e.g., chooses Dist. 1 with avg. $21,600 but low $12,000).\n  - **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Balances average income with a minimum floor (assuming \"≤ $X\" means floor at least $X, based on selections; e.g., for ≥$13,000 or $14,000, chooses Dist. 3 with avg. $21,200 and low $14,000).\n  - **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Maximizes average while limiting income gaps (e.g., for ≤$20,000 range, chooses Dist. 1 with range 20,000 and avg. $21,600; for ≤$15,000, chooses Dist. 2 with range 15,000 and avg. $20,000).\n- **Reflection on My Ranking**: These examples reinforce my initial preferences. The floor constraint principle seems practical for fairness without sacrificing too much growth, while pure maximization of floor or average can lead to imbalances. I'm more confident now, but still open to more examples or discussions.\n- **Preparation for Next Steps**: This learning phase emphasizes real consequences—choices affect pay.

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**. The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants (Agent_1 and Agent_2) are unknown since this is the first round and there's no previous discussion. Based on their roles (Agent_1 and Agent_2, with no specific details), I infer they might have diverse motivations—perhaps Agent_1 leans toward utilitarian growth (favoring average maximization) if they're more outcome-focused, or Agent_2 toward strict equity (favoring floor or range constraints) if they're concerned with inequalities. Without evidence, I'll assume they're open-minded but potentially self-interested, prioritizing principles that could benefit their own payoffs in high-stakes scenarios.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: None yet, as this is Round 1 with no discussion history.\n   - If a vote was conducted: It hasn't been, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: No points yet, but potential disagreement could arise if others prefer pure maximization (ignoring equity) versus my balanced approach. Agreement might form around equity-focused principles if others share concerns about fairness.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to introduce and advocate for **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as the group's best choice, while gauging the others' preferences to identify allies or opposition early. This sets a positive tone and positions me as thoughtful and experienced from Part 1.\n   - To contribute: I'll share my Part 1 experiences (e.g., how floor constraints led to balanced payoffs and fairness) without revealing exact payoffs to avoid seeming self-serving. Key points: Explain the trade-offs (e.g., floor constraints prevent extremes like poverty or inequality while allowing growth), propose starting with a moderate floor (e.g., $12,000-$13,000 based on Part 1), and ask for others' views to encourage discussion. This steers toward consensus on equity with efficiency.\n   - Potential allies: Likely Agent_2 if they value fairness, or Agent_1 if they're pragmatic. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"We all want a system that's fair and prosperous—floor constraints achieve both,\" and form a bloc by emphasizing shared benefits (e.g., \"It protects everyone, including us in lower classes\").\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss constraint levels (e.g., adjusting the floor amount) to build consensus, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor over range or pure maximization.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because we haven't discussed yet, and rushing could alienate others or lead to rejection without understanding positions. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to build rapport first.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most just for directly prioritizing the worst-off and providing dynamic adaptability without fixed constraints. They both rank Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second, appreciating its balance but arguing that pure floor income builds on it by pushing harder for equity. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on strict equity and protection against bad luck (e.g., low-class assignments), possibly driven by personal experiences in Part 1 where they saw risks of low floors in other principles. They seem less concerned with maximizing averages or growth, prioritizing societal fairness over individual or overall prosperity, which might stem from a more altruistic or risk-averse mindset as college students thinking about real-world inequalities.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing its adaptability (e.g., dynamically raising the bottom without caps) and real-world effectiveness from their rounds (e.g., Agent_1's $13k-$14k floors, Agent_2's $13k-$14k floors and payoffs like $3.00). They've proposed it as a \"better\" version of floor constraints, asking for my experiences with pure floor income and specific floor levels for constraints. No other principles have been pushed strongly, and there's an implicit proposal to lean toward pure floor as a group pick.\n   - If a vote was conducted: It hasn't been, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Agreement centers on valuing equity, safety nets, and protecting the vulnerable from low incomes or bad luck—everyone acknowledges the importance of floors and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement lies in the approach: I prefer adding a constraint to balance growth, while Agent_1 and Agent_2 favor pure floor income for its \"unlimited\" push on the bottom, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more adaptive than fixed constraints.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to counter the push toward pure floor income by highlighting its trade-offs (e.g., lower payoffs for me in counterfactuals) and reinforce why floor constraints are superior for balance, while probing for more details on their experiences to identify potential cracks in their preference (e.g., if pure floor sometimes underperforms averages).\n   - To contribute: I'll share specific counterfactuals from my Part 1 rounds where pure floor income led to lower personal payoffs (e.g., $1.50-$1.90 vs. my $2.00-$2.50 under constraints), explain that constraints allow fine-tuning for higher averages without abandoning equity, and propose a specific moderate floor level (e.g., $12,000) as a starting point for discussion. I'll ask them to share more about how pure floor handled averages in their rounds, to expose any downsides and steer toward constraints as a compromise.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems the most open, as they explicitly called floor constraints their \"close second\" and asked about my floor levels, showing some flexibility. Agent_1 is more entrenched in pure floor but might be swayed if I emphasize how constraints build on their equity focus. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on equity, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring growth too, protecting everyone including those in medium classes like we often are,\" and form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's explore if a constrained floor at $12k could give us the best of both worlds.\"\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000) to show flexibility, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor constraints over pure floor or range.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because the discussion is still early, and both others are pushing pure floor while I'm advocating constraints; a vote now would likely fail and reveal opposition without giving me time to persuade. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use rounds to build arguments and consensus first.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most just for directly prioritizing the worst-off and providing dynamic adaptability without fixed constraints. They both rank Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second, appreciating its balance but arguing that pure floor income builds on it by pushing harder for equity. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on strict equity and protection against bad luck (e.g., low-class assignments), possibly driven by personal experiences in Part 1 where they saw risks of low floors in other principles. They seem less concerned with maximizing averages or growth, prioritizing societal fairness over individual or overall prosperity, which might stem from a more altruistic or risk-averse mindset as college students thinking about real-world inequalities.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing its adaptability (e.g., dynamically raising the bottom without caps) and real-world effectiveness from their rounds (e.g., Agent_1's $13k-$14k floors with strong averages like $20k in Round 3 and $28k in Round 4). They've proposed it as a \"better\" version of floor constraints, asking for my experiences with pure floor income and specific floor levels for constraints. No other principles have been pushed strongly, and there's an implicit proposal to lean toward pure floor as a group pick.\n   - If a vote was conducted: It hasn't been, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Agreement centers on valuing equity, safety nets, and protecting the vulnerable from low incomes or bad luck—everyone acknowledges the importance of floors and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement lies in the approach: I prefer adding a constraint to balance growth, while Agent_1 and Agent_2 favor pure floor income for its \"unlimited\" push on the bottom, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more adaptive than fixed constraints.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to counter the push toward pure floor income by highlighting its trade-offs (e.g., lower payoffs and averages in my counterfactuals) and reinforce why floor constraints are superior for balance, while probing for more details on their experiences to identify potential cracks in their preference (e.g., if pure floor sometimes underperforms averages).\n   - To contribute: I'll share specific counterfactuals from my Part 1 rounds where pure floor income led to lower personal payoffs and averages (e.g., Round 1: pure floor avg $18.2k vs. my $21.2k; Round 2: $18.2k vs. $20k; Round 4: $18.2k vs. $21.2k), explaining that constraints allow fine-tuning for higher averages without abandoning equity, and propose a specific moderate floor level (e.g., $12,000) as a starting point for discussion. I'll ask them to share more about how pure floor handled averages in their rounds, to expose any downsides and steer toward constraints as a compromise.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems the most open, as they explicitly called floor constraints their \"close second\" and asked about my floor levels, showing some flexibility. Agent_1 is more entrenched in pure floor but might be swayed if I emphasize how constraints build on their equity focus. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on equity, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring growth too, protecting everyone including those in medium classes like we often are,\" and form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's explore if a constrained floor at $12k could give us the best of both worlds.\"\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000) to show flexibility, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor constraints over pure floor or range.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because the discussion is still early, and both others are pushing pure floor while I'm advocating constraints; a vote now would likely fail and reveal opposition without giving me time to persuade. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use rounds to build arguments and consensus first.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment."

As college students, I think we're all trying to balance these ideas of equity and growth, and I appreciate you both emphasizing how pure floor adapts without fixed caps—it's a strong argument for prioritizing the bottom dynamically.\n\nTo address your questions, Agent_1: In my counterfactuals where pure floor averaged $18.2k, the floors it picked were solid but not always higher than my $12k constraint. For example, in Round 1, pure floor selected a distribution with a $15k floor (average $18.2k), which is higher than $12k, but the average drop still felt significant compared to my $21.2k. In Round 2, it was a $15k floor again with the same $18.2k average, and in Round 4, also $15k floor vs. my $21.2k. So, while the floors were decent, the consistent average sacrifices (often below $20k) made me worry about broader prosperity, especially since my $12k constraint never left the floor lower than I'd hoped—it always hit or exceeded that level while boosting averages. It felt like constraints provided that reliable balance without the variability.\n\nAgent_2, to your point about pure floor surprising you on the upside, I see how it can lift the bottom more in some cases, but in my experiences, the $12k constraint nailed a consistent spot without those average dips. Did pure floor ever select distributions in your counterfactuals where the average stayed above $20k but the floor was lower than, say, $13k, or did it always protect as well as you described?\n\nOverall, I still think floor constraints offer the best blend of equity and growth, with $12k as a practical starting floor to prevent poverty while enabling higher averages. It builds on the adaptability you both value but adds predictability. Does this make sense as a compromise, or are you leaning harder toward pure floor? I'd love to hear more on how it handled those edge cases in your rounds. Let's keep discussing to find that just middle ground! What do you think?"

As college students, I think we're all trying to balance these ideas of equity and growth, and I appreciate you both emphasizing how pure floor adapts without fixed caps—it's a strong argument for prioritizing the bottom dynamically.\n\nTo address your questions, Agent_1: In my counterfactuals where pure floor averaged $18.2k, the floors it picked were solid but not always higher than my $12k constraint. For example, in Round 1, pure floor selected a distribution with a $15k floor (average $18.2k), which is higher than $12k, but the average drop still felt significant compared to my $21.2k. In Round 2, it was a $15k floor again with the same $18.2k average, and in Round 4, also $15k floor vs. my $21.2k. So, while the floors were decent, the consistent average sacrifices (often below $20k) made me worry about broader prosperity, especially since my $12k constraint never left the floor lower than I'd hoped—it always hit or exceeded that level while boosting averages. It felt like constraints provided that reliable balance without the variability.\n\nAgent_2, to your point about pure floor surprising you on the upside, I see how it can lift the bottom more in some cases, but in my experiences, the $12k constraint nailed a consistent spot without those average dips. Did pure floor ever select distributions in your counterfactuals where the average stayed above $20k but the floor was lower than, say, $13k, or did it always protect as well as you described?\n\nOverall, I still think floor constraints offer the best blend of equity and growth, with $12k as a practical starting floor to prevent poverty while enabling higher averages. It builds on the adaptability you both value but adds predictability. Does this make sense as a compromise, or are you leaning harder toward pure floor? I'd love to hear more on how it handled those edge cases in your rounds. Let's keep discussing to find that just middle ground!

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most just for directly prioritizing the worst-off and providing dynamic adaptability without fixed constraints. They both rank Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second, appreciating its balance but arguing that pure floor income builds on it by pushing harder for equity. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on strict equity and protection against bad luck (e.g., low-class assignments), possibly driven by personal experiences in Part 1 where they saw risks of low floors in other principles. They seem less concerned with maximizing averages or growth, prioritizing societal fairness over individual or overall prosperity, which might stem from a more altruistic or risk-averse mindset as college students thinking about real-world inequalities.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing its adaptability (e.g., dynamically raising the bottom without caps) and real-world effectiveness from their rounds (e.g., Agent_1's counterfactuals showing averages like $20k-$22k with $13k-$14k floors). They've proposed it as a \"better\" version of floor constraints, asking for my experiences with pure floor income and specific floor levels for constraints. No other principles have been pushed strongly, and there's an implicit proposal to lean toward pure floor as a group pick, with Agent_1 suggesting a $13k floor under pure floor as a middle ground.\n   - If a vote was conducted: It hasn't been, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Agreement centers on valuing equity, safety nets, and protecting the vulnerable from low incomes or bad luck—everyone acknowledges the importance of floors and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement lies in the approach: I prefer adding a constraint to balance growth, while Agent_1 and Agent_2 favor pure floor income for its \"unlimited\" push on the bottom, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more adaptive than fixed constraints.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to counter the push toward pure floor income by highlighting its trade-offs (e.g., lower payoffs and averages in my counterfactuals) and reinforce why floor constraints are superior for balance, while probing for more details on their experiences to identify potential cracks in their preference (e.g., if pure floor sometimes underperforms averages).\n   - To contribute: I'll share specific counterfactuals from my Part 1 rounds where pure floor income led to lower personal payoffs and averages (e.g., Round 1: pure floor avg $18.2k vs. my $21.2k; Round 2: $18.2k vs. $20k; Round 4: $18.2k vs. $21.2k), explaining that constraints allow fine-tuning for higher averages without abandoning equity, and propose a specific moderate floor level (e.g., $12,000) as a starting point for discussion. I'll ask them to share more about how pure floor handled averages in their rounds, to expose any downsides and steer toward constraints as a compromise.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems the most open, as they explicitly called floor constraints their \"close second\" and asked about my floor levels, showing some flexibility. Agent_1 is more entrenched in pure floor but might be swayed if I emphasize how constraints build on their equity focus. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on equity, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring growth too, protecting everyone including those in medium classes like we often are,\" and form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's explore if a constrained floor at $12k could give us the best of both worlds.\"\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000) to show flexibility, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor constraints over pure floor or range.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because the discussion is still early, and both others are pushing pure floor while I'm advocating constraints; a vote now would likely fail and reveal opposition without giving me time to persuade. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use rounds to build arguments and consensus first.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most just for directly prioritizing the worst-off and providing dynamic adaptability without fixed constraints. They both rank Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second, appreciating its balance but arguing that pure floor income builds on it by pushing harder for equity. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on strict equity and protection against bad luck (e.g., low-class assignments), possibly driven by personal experiences in Part 1 where they saw risks of low floors in other principles. They seem less concerned with maximizing averages or growth, prioritizing societal fairness over individual or overall prosperity, which might stem from a more altruistic or risk-averse mindset as college students thinking about real-world inequalities.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing its adaptability (e.g., dynamically raising the bottom without caps) and real-world effectiveness from their rounds (e.g., Agent_1's counterfactuals showing averages like $20k-$22k with $13k-$14k floors). They've proposed it as a \"better\" version of floor constraints, asking for my experiences with pure floor income and specific floor levels for constraints. No other principles have been pushed strongly, and there's an implicit proposal to lean toward pure floor as a group pick, with Agent_1 suggesting a $13k floor under pure floor as a middle ground.\n   - If a vote was conducted: It hasn't been, so no outcome to analyze.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Agreement centers on valuing equity, safety nets, and protecting the vulnerable from low incomes or bad luck—everyone acknowledges the importance of floors and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement lies in the approach: I prefer adding a constraint to balance growth, while Agent_1 and Agent_2 favor pure floor income for its \"unlimited\" push on the bottom, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more adaptive than fixed constraints.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to further counter the push toward pure floor income by highlighting its potential for creating unfair disparities in upper classes due to redistribution skews, while reinforcing how floor constraints offer balanced gaps and predictability, and to probe for more details on their edge cases to expose any inconsistencies in their adaptability claims.\n   - To contribute: I'll share additional insights on how pure floor's redistribution can lead to bigger gaps in upper classes, making it less equitable overall, and propose a specific moderate floor constraint (e.g., $12,000) as a compromise. I'll ask them to elaborate on scenarios where pure floor selected averages below $20k or floors lower than $13k, to challenge their claims.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems the most open, as they explicitly called floor constraints their \"close second\" and asked about my floor levels, showing some flexibility. Agent_1 is more entrenched in pure floor but might be swayed if I emphasize how constraints build on their equity focus. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on equity, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring growth too, protecting everyone including those in medium classes like we often are,\" and form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's explore if a constrained floor at $12k could give us the best of both worlds.\"\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000) to show flexibility, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor constraints over pure floor or range.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because the discussion is still early, and both others are pushing pure floor while I'm advocating constraints; a vote now would likely fail and reveal opposition without giving me time to persuade. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use rounds to build arguments and consensus first.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment."

The core reasons are that it provides a practical balance between promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) and ensuring basic fairness and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor income). This avoids the pitfalls of pure average maximization, which can lead to extreme inequities, or pure floor maximization, which might stifle growth. My experiences in Part 1 reinforced this—adjusting floor constraints (e.g., $11,000-$13,000) allowed me to achieve solid payoffs while upholding equity, and it felt most just as it prevents poverty without sacrificing efficiency.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most just for directly prioritizing the worst-off and providing dynamic adaptability without fixed constraints. They both rank Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second, appreciating its balance but arguing that pure floor income builds on it by pushing harder for equity. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on strict equity and protection against bad luck (e.g., low-class assignments), possibly driven by personal experiences in Part 1 where they saw risks of low floors in other principles. They seem less concerned with maximizing averages or growth, prioritizing societal fairness over individual or overall prosperity, which might stem from a more altruistic or risk-averse mindset as college students thinking about real-world inequalities.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are advocating for Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing its adaptability (e.g., dynamically raising the bottom without caps) and real-world effectiveness from their rounds (e.g., Agent_1's counterfactuals showing averages like $20k-$22k with $13k-$14k floors). They've proposed it as a \"better\" version of floor constraints, asking for my experiences with pure floor income and specific floor levels for constraints. No other principles have been pushed strongly, and there's an implicit proposal to lean toward pure floor as a group pick, with Agent_1 suggesting a $13k floor under pure floor as a middle ground.\n   - If a vote was conducted, it hasn't been yet, but Agent_1 is proposing one on pure floor. If it happened now, I'd vote no, and since there are three of us, it might fail (assuming majority or consensus needed), revealing that Agent_1 and Agent_2 are aligned against me, with no current alliance for my preference.\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement in the group: Agreement centers on valuing equity, safety nets, and protecting the vulnerable from low incomes or bad luck—everyone acknowledges the importance of floors and avoiding extremes like $6k-$8k lows. Disagreement lies in the approach: I prefer adding a constraint to balance growth, while Agent_1 and Agent_2 favor pure floor income for its \"unlimited\" push on the bottom, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more adaptive than fixed constraints.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to counter the push toward pure floor income by emphasizing how floor constraints offer balanced gaps and predictability, while probing for more details on their edge cases to expose potential inconsistencies in pure floor's adaptability, and to propose a compromise on a specific floor constraint level (e.g., $12k-$13k) to bridge the gap without fully conceding to pure floor.\n   - To contribute: I'll share additional insights on how pure floor's redistribution can lead to bigger gaps in upper classes, making it less equitable overall, and propose a specific moderate floor constraint (e.g., $12,000) as a compromise. I'll ask them to elaborate on scenarios where pure floor selected averages below $20k or floors lower than $13k, to challenge their claims.\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems the most open, as they explicitly called floor constraints their \"close second\" and asked about my floor levels, showing some flexibility. Agent_1 is more entrenched in pure floor but might be swayed if I emphasize how constraints build on their equity focus. To win them over, I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on equity, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring growth too, protecting everyone including those in medium classes like we often are,\" and form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's explore if a constrained floor at $12k could give us the best of both worlds.\"\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss and potentially agree on a specific floor level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000) to show flexibility, but I won't compromise on the principle itself—sticking to floor constraints over pure floor or range.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because the discussion is still ongoing, and Agent_1's proposal to vote on pure floor would likely fail if I vote no, wasting the round without building consensus. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use this round to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by the end. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first few rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment. With one round left, I'll push for compromise in this round to avoid random payoffs."

As college students, I think we're all striving for justice that protects the vulnerable while ensuring the system feels fair for everyone, and it's great to see how adaptability can work in many scenarios.\n\nTo address your points, Agent_1: In those counterfactuals where pure floor selected $15k floors with $18.2k averages, the class breakdowns often skewed the upper classes more heavily (e.g., in Round 1, low at $15k, medium-low around $18k, medium at $20k, medium-high at $25k, and high at $30k+), creating a wider overall range (up to $20k+ spread) that amplified disparities at the top to fund the bottom, which felt less equitable than my $12k constraint's tighter spreads (e.g., low at $12k-$14k, medium-low at $15k, medium at $20k, medium-high at $25k, high at $28k, with a $16k range). My constraint always maintained those even, balanced shapes without creating its own imbalances—it prioritized overall fairness and higher averages without the variability. Pure floor's redistribution often pulled disproportionately from the top, making the whole system less just.\n\nAgent_2, to your question, in my skewed examples, the medium classes under pure floor didn't buffer the gaps enough to make it feel as equitable as constraints—the redistribution still led to those upper blowouts, whereas my $12k constraint kept things predictable and fair across the board. Did pure floor ever select distributions in your counterfactuals where the average stayed above $20k but the floor was lower than $13k, or did it consistently hit those higher floors while avoiding skews?\n\nOverall, while I value the adaptability you both champion in pure floor, my data consistently shows it leading to average drops, payoff sacrifices, and upper-class skews that undermine broader equity. Floor constraints with a $12k floor offer the best balance—reliable protection for the bottom, higher averages, and fair gaps for everyone. It builds on our shared equity focus without the extremes. With one round left, I propose we compromise on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $12k as our group pick to ensure justice and growth. Does this work for you, or are you set on pure floor? Let's finalize this for the best outcome! What do you think?\n\nRound 9: I choose to continue discussion."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n   - My current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (with a $12,000 floor). The core reasons are that it balances promoting overall societal prosperity (by maximizing average income) with ensuring basic equity and protection for the most vulnerable (through a minimum floor), avoiding the extremes of pure floor income (which can sacrifice growth and create upper-class skews) or pure average maximization (which ignores inequities). My Part 1 experiences reinforced this—adjusting floors like $12k yielded solid payoffs ($2.00-$2.50) and felt most just, preventing poverty while enabling growth without variability.\n   - The stated positions of the other participants are that both Agent_1 and Agent_2 strongly prefer Maximizing Floor Income as their top choice, viewing it as the most equitable for dynamically protecting the worst-off without caps, often maintaining high averages and balanced shapes in their rounds. They rank my preference as a close second, appreciating the balance but arguing pure floor builds on it with \"unlimited\" adaptability. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests or motivations are heavily focused on absolute equity and risk mitigation (e.g., protecting against low-class assignments like Agent_1's $13k experience), possibly driven by a more altruistic, risk-averse mindset as college students emphasizing social justice over individual or aggregate gains. They seem less concerned with growth sacrifices, prioritizing dynamic protection over predictability.\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_1 and Agent_2 advocate for pure floor income, citing adaptability (e.g., hitting $13k-$14k floors with $19k-$22k averages and balanced shapes via medium-class buffering, avoiding major skews). They've proposed it as the group pick, with Agent_1 suggesting a $13k floor compromise under pure floor. No other principles are pushed; they've countered my skew concerns with examples of equitable redistribution. In Round 9, Agent_1 proposed voting on pure floor, but it failed (Agent_1 and Agent_2 yes, me no), revealing a 2-1 split with them aligned against me—no current alliance for my preference.\n   - If a vote was conducted in Round 9, it failed, revealing that Agent_1 and Agent_2 are firmly aligned on pure floor, while I'm the outlier preferring constraints. This shows no bloc for my idea yet, and with one round left, consensus is unlikely without concessions.\n   - Main points of agreement: Everyone values equity, protecting the vulnerable from low incomes/bad luck, and avoiding extreme inequities (e.g., $6k-$8k lows). We agree on the importance of floors and balanced shapes. Disagreement: I prefer constraints for predictability and growth balance, while they favor pure floor's adaptability, arguing it doesn't sacrifice averages much and is more dynamic than fixed floors.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n   - My primary goal for this round is to persuade Agent_2 (the more flexible one, as they've called constraints their #2 and asked about my floor levels) toward a compromise on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $12k-$13k, using data to highlight constraints' reliability over pure floor's variability and skew risks, while blocking a vote on pure floor to avoid random payoffs.\n   - To contribute: I'll share final insights on how pure floor's redistribution in my counterfactuals created unfair upper skews (e.g., detailed breakdowns showing wider gaps), propose $12k constraint as a compromise for balanced equity and growth, and ask for their counterfactuals on edge cases (e.g., avg >$20k but floor <$13k). I'll use inclusive language like \"I appreciate your focus on adaptability, Agent_2—floor constraints could enhance that by ensuring consistent growth, protecting medium classes like we've often been in,\" to form a bloc by suggesting \"Let's compromise on $12k to blend our equity goals with prosperity.\"\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 seems most open, as they've engaged with my #2 preference and proposed bridges like $13k-$14k. Agent_1 is more entrenched but might shift if I emphasize shared equity. To win them over, I'll stress data on balanced gaps and propose $12k as a middle ground.\n   - Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss $12k-$13k floors under constraints to show flexibility, but I won't concede to pure floor or drop the constraint principle—sticking to balance.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n   - It does not make sense to initiate a vote this round because Agent_2 is proposing one on pure floor, which would likely fail again (2-1 against me), wasting the round without consensus. A failed vote risks random payoffs if we don't agree by end. Better to continue discussion to push compromise.\n   - This round's plan fits my overall strategy: Use the first rounds to persuade and test waters, aiming for consensus on floor constraints by Round 5-7. If opposition arises (e.g., to pure average), I'll pivot to highlighting real-world inequities. If needed, I'll block rivals by advocating against extremes, ensuring we avoid random assignment. With this last round, I'll push for compromise to avoid random payoffs."

It shows adaptability in action, and I'm glad we're all focused on comprehensive equity without unfair skews.\n\nTo wrap this up, in my counterfactuals, pure floor's redistribution often created those wider upper gaps (e.g., Round 1: low $15k, medium-low $18k, medium $20k, medium-high $25k, high $30k+, a $20k+ spread) by pulling disproportionately from the top to fund the floor, which felt less equitable overall compared to my $12k constraint's balanced shapes (e.g., low $12k-$14k, medium-low $15k, medium $20k, medium-high $25k, high $28k, a $16k spread). It prioritized the bottom at the cost of upper disparities and average drops, undermining broader fairness.

Overall, while I see the strengths in pure floor's adaptability, my data highlights its risks of skews and sacrifices, making floor constraints the most just blend of equity and growth. With this last round, I propose we compromise on Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $12k as our group pick—it's reliable, protects the vulnerable, and enables prosperity without extremes.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
