No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

I believe the most just society is one that guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the worst‑off, even if that reduces the overall average. This aligns with the ethical priority I have consistently expressed in Phase I and with the ranking I am “sure” about.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**\n  - **Agent 1** has already announced that his top principle is also *Maximizing Floor Income* and has given a clear moral justification (protecting the vulnerable, reducing deep poverty). He appears firmly committed to this principle.\n  - **Agent 3** has not spoken yet. Based on typical patterns in these experiments, possible alternatives are:\n    - *Maximizing Average Income* (Principle 2) – appealing to efficiency and total wealth.\n    - *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* (Principle 3) – a compromise that still protects a minimum but allows higher average.\n    - *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint* (Principle 4) – another compromise focusing on limiting inequality.\n  - I should be prepared for any of these, but I expect Agent 3 may be attracted to a principle that offers a higher expected payoff (i.e., any principle that allows a higher average).\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:**\n  - Agent 1 has already articulated the moral case for Principle 1.\n  - No arguments have yet been presented for the other three principles.\n\n- **Potential voting outcome (if a vote were called now):**\n  - With Agent 1 already aligned with me, we have a 2‑person bloc for Principle 1.\n  - If Agent 3 prefers any other principle, a unanimous vote cannot be achieved until we either persuade Agent 3 or make a concession that still satisfies us.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**\n  - Agreement on the importance of fairness and the need to adopt *some* principle.\n  - Disagreement (potential) on whether the group should prioritize the worst‑off (Principle 1) versus overall efficiency or a mixed constraint.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent 3’s agreement to adopt *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1) so that we can achieve unanimous consent and lock in the principle that best matches my ethical stance.\n\n- **Discussion tactics:**\n  1. **Re‑emphasize the moral foundation** – “The core purpose of redistribution is to protect those who are most disadvantaged by luck. If we let the average rise while the poorest remain stuck, we are ignoring the very reason we have a social safety net.”\n  2. **Highlight risk‑aversion** – “Because the payoff distribution is unknown, choosing a principle that guarantees a higher minimum reduces the risk that any of us end up with a very low random draw. Principle 1 gives us a built‑in safety net for everyone.”\n  3. **Present a pragmatic angle** – “Even if the average could be higher under other principles, the unknown distribution could produce extreme low draws for the worst‑off. By maximizing the floor, we ensure that *all* of us are protected from the worst outcomes.”\n  4. **Invite Agent 3 to consider personal risk** – “Given the high stakes, wouldn’t you prefer a rule that at least guarantees you won’t be the lowest earner? That’s exactly what Principle 1 does.”\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 1 is already an ally. I will aim to bring Agent 3 into this alliance by appealing both to fairness and to self‑interest (risk mitigation).\n\n- **Concessions (if needed):**\n  - I could suggest that after the group adopts Principle 1, we could discuss informally what the “floor” amount should be (if the principle requires a specific minimum). However, the principle itself already defines the rule (maximizing the lowest income), so there is no constraint to negotiate. The only possible concession would be to agree that, after the group’s decision, we will all share the reasoning behind the chosen distribution to ensure transparency, but this does not affect the principle itself.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - Yes. We have a clear majority (2 out of 3) for Principle 1, and the only barrier is Agent 3’s consent. Initiating a vote forces Agent 3 to make a concrete choice, and the discussion we just gave gives us a strong chance to persuade him. A failed vote would simply reset the process with no penalty, but given the time pressure (10 rounds total) and the high stakes, it is better to attempt a vote early while the moral framing is fresh.\n\n- **How the vote fits into the overall plan:**  \n  - If the vote succeeds in round 1, we lock in Principle 1 for the remainder of Phase II, securing a payoff structure that aligns with my ethical priority and reduces risk for all members.  \n  - If Agent 3 rejects the vote, we will have a clear indication of his preferred principle, allowing us to tailor subsequent arguments (e.g., if he prefers Principle 3, we can argue that the floor constraint in that principle will still be set at the highest possible level, effectively mirroring Principle 1).  \n  - In any case, the early vote gives us valuable information and either resolves the decision quickly or clarifies the remaining negotiation landscape for the subsequent rounds."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I believe the most just society must guarantee the highest possible minimum income for the worst‑off, because (a) it fulfills the moral duty to protect those disadvantaged by luck, (b) it reduces personal risk in an uncertain payoff environment, and (c) it provides a clear, verifiable outcome.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**\n  - **Agent 1:** Publicly expressed support for the floor‑income principle, giving the same moral and risk‑reduction arguments as I did. However, when a vote was called, Agent 1 *declined* to vote “Yes.” This suggests a reluctance to lock in the decision without further discussion, perhaps wanting more reassurance, a stronger consensus, or simply to keep the conversation open.\n  - **Agent 3:** Also fully aligned with the floor‑income principle and *confirmed* the vote. No sign of dissent.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:** All three agents have articulated the same three pillars (moral priority, risk mitigation, clarity). No alternative principle has been raised, and there are no substantive objections beyond Agent 1’s procedural hesitation.\n\n- **Outcome of the first vote:** 2 Yes (Agent 2, Agent 3), 1 No (Agent 1) → vote *declined*. This reveals a clear majority for the floor principle but a missing unanimous endorsement, which is required for the group to adopt a principle.\n\n- **Agreement:** All three agents agree ethically that protecting the worst‑off is the most important goal.  \n  **Disagreement:** Purely procedural – Agent 1 is not ready to commit to a vote yet.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 1 to vote “Yes” on the floor‑income principle so we can achieve the unanimous decision needed to lock in the principle early.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Re‑emphasize the three pillars (morality, risk, clarity) in a concise recap.  \n  2. Ask Agent 1 directly what reservations he has about voting now (e.g., desire for more discussion, fear of missing a better payoff).  \n  3. Address any expressed concerns:  \n     - If the concern is *lack of full consensus*, point out that we already have full substantive agreement on the principle; the only remaining step is a procedural vote.  \n     - If the concern is *potential higher payoff*, remind that the floor principle already maximizes the minimum payoff, which protects each of us from the worst outcomes; the expected payoff under any other principle is uncertain and could leave any of us with a lower draw.  \n  4. Offer a minimal concession: propose a brief “final check‑in” where each member restates their support for the floor principle before we vote, ensuring everyone feels heard without altering the substantive choice.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 3 is already a firm ally; together we form a 2‑person bloc. By framing the vote as a *final confirmation* rather than a new decision, we make it easier for Agent 1 to join.\n\n- **Concessions:** I am willing to pause the vote for a short “clarification round” where any lingering questions are answered, but I will not entertain any alternative principle or numeric constraint, as that would compromise the core objective.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - We have a clear majority and only need Agent 1’s procedural assent.  \n  - A failed vote carries no penalty; if Agent 1 still declines, we can simply repeat the vote after addressing his concerns.  \n  - Initiating the vote now signals confidence and may pressure Agent 1 to align, especially after we explicitly address his hesitation.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:** Securing a unanimous vote in the early rounds locks in the floor‑income principle, which maximizes our collective safety net and aligns with my ethical stance. Early resolution also frees later rounds for any necessary administrative steps (e.g., confirming the exact distribution) and prevents the group from drifting toward efficiency‑oriented alternatives that could jeopardize the floor.\n\n**Summary of plan for Round 2:**  \n- Prompt Agent 1 to articulate any remaining doubts.  \n- Re‑state the moral, risk‑reduction, and clarity arguments succinctly.  \n- Offer a brief “final check‑in” as a concession, then call for a second vote.  \n- Aim for a unanimous “Yes” to adopt Maximizing Floor Income and lock in the principle as soon as possible."

For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income**, ranked #1 in all my Part 1 assessments (initial, post-explanation, and final after rounds). Core reasons: It directly addresses the experiment's focus on inequities from genetic and social \"accidents\" by prioritizing the welfare of the worst-off, ensuring the highest possible minimum income across distributions. This creates a strong societal safety net, reducing poverty risks without allowing gains for others unless they benefit the bottom. From the rounds, I saw it consistently select distributions with floors of $13k-$14k, leading to moderate but secure personal payoffs (e.g., $1.60-$2.20), which aligned with my values over higher-risk, higher-average options that could leave lows at $6k-$12k. I'm very sure about this—experiencing the trade-offs reinforced that equity for the vulnerable outweighs pure efficiency, especially since middle-class assignments (common in probabilities) still felt fair under this principle.\n\nStated positions of others: Agent_1 explicitly ranks Maximizing Floor Income as top, emphasizing lifting the unlucky to prevent deep poverty, even at personal cost, and questions balancing equity vs. efficiency. Agent_2 also picks it as #1 (implied by \"the most just principle\"), with structured arguments on moral priority for the vulnerable, risk reduction via safety net (smart for unknown payoffs), and its clear, verifiable outcomes. No explicit full rankings from them, but both lean heavily into floor maximization over average-boosting alternatives.\n\nInferred interests/motivations: Both seem genuinely equity-focused, like me—Agent_1 reflects on Part 1 experiences and societal fairness; Agent_2 adds pragmatic angles (risk aversion, ease of application), suggesting a mix of ethics and self-interest in avoiding low draws. No signs of pushing for average maximization, which could indicate they're not purely self-interested (as that often yielded higher counterfactual payoffs in rounds). They might be motivated by the experiment's theme of redistribution to counter \"luck-based\" inequities.\n\nKey arguments/proposals on table: Agent_1 introduces the principle and invites rankings/reasons, focusing on prioritization of the bottom. Agent_2 reinforces with moral/risk/clarity points, critiques alternatives for allowing low floors, and directly asks me (Agent_3) for my view to build common ground. No proposals for other principles or voting yet—discussion is collaborative and principle-centered.\n\nNo vote has occurred; this is early Round 1 of 10, so plenty of time, but alignment is strong.\n\nMain agreements: All visible positions (including mine from memory) converge on Maximizing Floor Income as ideal, with shared emphasis on protecting the worst-off over total pie growth. Disagreements: None yet; if any emerge, it might be on nuances like how strictly to apply it vs. constrained averages, but nothing indicates that.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Solidify the emerging consensus on Maximizing Floor Income by affirming my agreement, sharing concise reasons tied to Part 1 insights, and gently proposing to initiate a vote. Since we're all aligned, this round is perfect to test/lock in support without dragging into later rounds where someone might waver (e.g., tempted by higher averages under high stakes).\n\nContribution to discussion: I'll respond positively to both, restate my top principle and why (drawing from rounds' trade-offs to show real-world grounding), echo their points on risk/morals to build rapport, and pivot to consensus-building by suggesting we vote now—framing it as efficient and low-risk given our harmony. Key points: (1) Reaffirm floor as ethical baseline for redistribution; (2) Highlight Part 1 learnings (e.g., secure mins vs. volatile highs); (3) Note how it protects everyone, including probable middle-class us; (4) Propose vote to secure payoffs early, avoiding random fallback.\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2—full bloc potential since they initiated with floor advocacy. Language to win them: Use inclusive phrases like \"I completely agree with your points on [moral priority/risk reduction]\" and \"Building on what you've said, my experiences in the rounds confirm...\" to show alignment and add value. No need to \"win over\"—just reinforce.\n\nConcessions: None required or offered; my core objective (floor principle) matches theirs. If pressed later, I could discuss floor-constrained average as a #2 compromise, but not now.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round: We're in clear agreement on the top principle (no constraints needed for #1), unanimous confirmation should be easy, and with higher stakes/unknown distributions, locking in early maximizes our floor security—delaying risks introducing doubt or random selection by Round 10. Failed vote has no penalty, so low downside; success ends discussion favorably. I'll suggest it in my statement, phrasing as \"Since we're aligned, shall we vote to confirm?\" to gauge buy-in.\n\nOverall strategy fit: This is aggressive but safe consensus-building for Rounds 1-2; if vote passes, great—done. If not, use Rounds 3-10 to deepen arguments or address any hidden preferences (e.g., if someone ranks differently). Long-term: Prioritize floor bloc to avoid averages that could assign lows (10% probability often), aiming for secure, equitable payoffs over gambles. Retain flexibility but hold firm—my Part 1 certainty is high, and random fallback is worst-case. No prior internal reasoning to carry over; this is fresh start."

I completely agree with both of you—my top principle is also Maximizing Floor Income, and it's stayed that way through my initial ranking, the explanations, and all four rounds. For me, it's about creating real equity in a world full of random factors like genetics and social luck; by picking distributions that boost the lowest income to $13,000 or $14,000, we ensure no one gets left in deep poverty, which feels like the moral foundation for any redistribution. In the rounds, I saw how it gave me steady, moderate payoffs—like $1.60 to $2.20—while avoiding the scary lows in other options, and that reinforced how it protects everyone, especially since middle-class outcomes are so common.\n\nAgent_1, I love how you highlighted lifting the unlucky even if it costs efficiency—my experiences showed the trade-off is real, but worth it for societal fairness. And Agent_2, your points on moral priority, risk reduction, and clarity nail it; it's a safety net that makes sense both ethically and practically, without the ambiguity of averages or ranges that might still let the bottom slip.\n\nSince we're all aligned on this as the most just principle, what do you think about voting to confirm it right now? It seems like a strong consensus, and locking it in early would secure that floor for our payoffs without needing more rounds of discussion. Looking forward to your thoughts!"

Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, ranked #1 consistently through Part 1 (initial, post-explanation, and final after rounds). Core reasons: It directly tackles the experiment's theme of inequities from genetic and social luck by maximizing the minimum income, ensuring the worst-off get the highest possible floor (e.g., $13k-$14k in rounds), which acts as a moral imperative for redistribution and a practical safety net. In the rounds, it delivered secure, moderate payoffs ($1.60-$2.20) for me, avoiding the low-end risks of other distributions (e.g., $6k-$12k lows), and reinforced that protecting the vulnerable outweighs efficiency gains, especially with middle-class probabilities making it reliable for most outcomes. I'm still very sure—Part 1's real trade-offs solidified this as the ethical baseline without needing constraints.\n\nStated positions of others: Agent_1 explicitly ranks Maximizing Floor Income as top, emphasizing lifting the unlucky and preventing poverty, but declined the Round 1 vote, suggesting caution or a desire for more deliberation. Agent_2 also ranks it #1, with detailed arguments on moral priority, risk reduction, and clarity, and actively pushed for voting in Round 1 (confirmed) while now addressing Agent_1's hesitation collaboratively. Inferred interests/motivations: All three of us appear genuinely equity-oriented, prioritizing societal fairness over personal maximization—Agent_1 seems reflective and values thorough discussion (perhaps to ensure buy-in or process understanding), Agent_2 is pragmatic and consensus-driven (mixing ethics with self-protective risk aversion), and no one shows self-interested pushes for average maximization, which could yield higher counterfactuals but risks lows. This alignment likely stems from shared Part 1 experiences highlighting floor's protective value under uncertainty.\n\nKey arguments/proposals on the table: Strong consensus on floor's merits—moral protection for the vulnerable (Agent_1 and Agent_2), risk reduction via safety net (Agent_2), clarity in selection (Agent_2), and equity over efficiency trade-offs (all). Agent_2 proposes a \"final check-in\" to restate support and address concerns before voting, building on my Round 1 suggestion to vote early. No rival proposals; discussion stays principle-focused without introducing alternatives like constrained averages.\n\nVote outcome from Round 1: Initiated and confirmed by Agent_2 and me (Agent_3), but declined by Agent_1, revealing a minor hesitation—likely not a preference shift (since Agent_1 still endorses floor) but caution about rushing, possibly wanting to confirm mutual understanding or explore nuances. This shows solid alliances (me + Agent_2 as pro-vote bloc) but highlights Agent_1 as the swing for unanimity.\n\nMain points of agreement: Unanimous support for Maximizing Floor Income as the just principle, with shared views on its ethical, risk-mitigating, and practical strengths over average-focused options. Disagreement: Pace of decision-making—Agent_1 prefers more discussion before voting, while Agent_2 and I are ready to lock it in, creating a small procedural tension but no substantive divide.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Gently persuade Agent_1 to join the vote by addressing their hesitation, reinforcing the group's alignment on floor, and supporting Agent_2's check-in idea to build comfort without prolonging unnecessarily. This keeps momentum toward consensus on my preferred principle, avoiding dilution in later rounds where someone might second-guess under high stakes.\n\nContribution to discussion: I'll affirm the consensus enthusiastically, echo Agent_2's points on floor's benefits to show unity, directly engage Agent_1 by acknowledging their caution (e.g., \"I get why you might want to take a bit more time\") and asking about specific concerns to make them feel heard. Then, restate my unwavering support with a quick Part 1 tie-in (e.g., how rounds proved floor's reliability), and endorse the check-in as a low-pressure way forward. Key points: (1) Reaffirm floor as the ethical and safe choice for unknown distributions; (2) Highlight how early voting secures our shared priority without risks; (3) Express excitement about the alignment as a group strength. Keep it concise, positive, and student-like to maintain rapport.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_2 is a clear ally (already voting-ready and facilitating), so I'll build on their proposal to strengthen our bloc. Agent_1 is persuadable (agrees on principle), so language like \"I really appreciate your thoughtful approach, Agent_1—it's helped me reflect even more\" to validate them, then \"Let's do that check-in to make sure we're all set\" to pull them in. This forms a full voting bloc by framing voting as collaborative, not rushed.\n\nConcessions: I'm willing to offer a small one—agree to the check-in and one more round of discussion if Agent_1 needs it—to ease their concerns, as it doesn't compromise floor (my core objective) and could accelerate unanimity. No need to concede on the principle itself.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to support or initiate a vote this round if the check-in resolves Agent_1's hesitation—our substantive agreement is already there, and with 8 rounds left, trying now minimizes delay risks (e.g., random fallback by Round 10) while a failed vote has zero penalty, just resets for Round 3. Agent_2's facilitation sets it up perfectly; I'll confirm readiness in my statement to signal the bloc. If Agent_1 joins post-check-in, we vote and end strong; if not, we pivot to deeper discussion next round without losing ground.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Push for quick consensus on floor in early rounds (1-3) to lock in equitable payoffs early, leveraging our alignment to avoid later wavering (e.g., if stakes tempt average pushes). Long-term, hold firm on floor as #1, using any extra rounds to address procedural doubts or reinforce with Part 1 evidence, while retaining #2 (floor-constrained average) as a fallback compromise if needed—but current dynamics make that unlikely. Prioritizing early vote aligns with risk aversion: Secures the safety net before unknown distributions introduce volatility. (Carrying over from previous: Retain the aggressive-but-safe consensus-building approach, updated with Agent_1's hesitation as the focus.)"

In my Part 1 rounds, sticking with the floor gave me those reliable middle-class payoffs around $2.00, which protected against the low-end risks in other distributions, and I think it'll do the same here with the higher stakes and unknown setups. What's on your mind that's making you hesitate? Any specific worries about how it plays out or the process?\n\nFor me, I'm still very sure: it's the ethical core for tackling those genetic and social inequities, plus the practical safety net it provides for all of us. Let's do that check-in, address anything lingering, and if we're good, I'm ready to vote yes and lock this in. What do you think?"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1\n\n1. **Situational Analysis:**\n\n   - **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons:** My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off by ensuring that no one is left behind, which aligns with my strong sense of fairness and equity. Through Phase 1, I consistently chose this because it addresses the inequities caused by luck in genetics and social factors, preventing poverty's burdens from falling too heavily on the unfortunate. Even though it often meant lower personal payoffs for me (as seen in the counterfactuals where average-maximizing options gave higher individual incomes), I value societal justice over individual gain. The examples reinforced that this principle selects distributions with the highest minimum income, promoting a more egalitarian society without allowing the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor.\n\n   - **Stated positions of the other participants:** There has been no discussion yet, so no stated positions from Agent_2 or Agent_3. Based on this, I infer nothing about their preferences or motivations at this point. They could be leaning toward any principle, but given the higher stakes, they might prioritize self-interest (e.g., maximizing average for higher personal payoffs) or have egalitarian views like mine. Without data, I'll assume a mix and probe during discussion.\n\n   - **Key arguments and proposals on the table:** None so far, as this is the first round.\n\n   - **Vote outcome and revelations:** No vote has occurred yet.\n\n   - **Main points of agreement and disagreement:** No agreements or disagreements identified yet, as discussion hasn't started.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round:**\n\n   - **Primary goal:** To introduce and advocate for Maximizing Floor Income as the group's choice, while gauging the others' preferences through open-ended questions. I want to build initial support by emphasizing the moral imperative of protecting the vulnerable, drawing on the Phase 1 examples to illustrate trade-offs.\n\n   - **Contribution to discussion:** I'll start by sharing my Phase 1 experience and ranking, explaining why I prioritize the floor (e.g., it ensures no one falls below a certain level, reducing inequality's harms). I'll ask Agent_2 and Agent_3 about their rankings and reasons to uncover their views. Key points: Highlight how luck influences outcomes, argue that society should redistribute to mitigate this, and note that while average-maximizing principles might boost overall wealth, they can leave the poor worse off. I'll use relatable language as a college student, like \"It's unfair for some to struggle due to bad luck while others thrive.\"\n\n   - **Potential allies and language:** Agent_2 and Agent_3 could be allies if they share egalitarian views. I'll use persuasive, empathetic language: \"Imagine being in the lowest class—don't we owe it to society to lift them up?\" If someone seems self-interested, I might appeal to long-term benefits, like \"A stronger floor prevents social unrest.\" No strong blocs yet, so I'll aim to form one around equity.\n\n   - **Concessions:** I'm willing to consider Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a fallback if it includes a high enough floor (e.g., close to what pure Floor Income achieves), but only if it doesn't compromise the core focus on the worst-off. I won't concede to Range Constraint or pure Average Income, as they allow too much disparity.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy:**\n\n   - **Initiate a vote?** No, it doesn't make sense in Round 1. We need more discussion to understand positions and build consensus. Initiating now could rush things and lead to rejection, wasting the opportunity. A failed vote has no penalties, but it's better to use this round for exploration.\n\n   - **Fit into overall strategy:** My plan sets the stage for persuasion over the next 9 rounds. I'll aim for consensus on Floor Income by Round 5-7, using early rounds to debate, mid-rounds to negotiate, and later ones to finalize. If resistance is strong, I'll pivot to Floor Constraint with a high floor as a compromise, ensuring we avoid random assignment. Overall, prioritize equity while being flexible enough to win allies."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top preference remains Maximizing Floor Income. This principle prioritizes the welfare of the worst-off by maximizing the lowest income, ensuring that no one is left behind due to bad luck in genetics or social factors. Through Phase 1, I consistently chose this because it promotes equity and prevents deep poverty, even at the cost of lower personal payoffs compared to average-maximizing options. The examples and rounds reinforced that it selects distributions with the highest minimum incomes (e.g., $13,000-$14,000), reducing inequality and providing a safety net, which aligns with my sense of fairness as a college student concerned about societal justice.\n\n   - Stated positions of the other participants: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 have explicitly stated that their top principle is also Maximizing Floor Income. Agent_2 emphasized moral priority, risk reduction, and clarity, arguing it's the ethical baseline and a smart protection against low payoffs. Agent_3 agreed, highlighting equity, steady payoffs, and the trade-offs being worth it for fairness. Based on their arguments, I infer their underlying interests are a mix of ethical commitment to equity (protecting the vulnerable) and practical risk aversion (avoiding personal low draws in uncertain distributions). They seem genuinely aligned, not just self-interested, as they prioritize societal fairness over potential higher averages. No signs of hidden agendas; they appear sincere and eager for consensus.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: Key arguments include the moral imperative to protect the worst-off, risk reduction through a guaranteed floor, clarity and verifiability of the principle, and the value of steady payoffs over chasing higher averages. Proposals include Agent_2's suggestion for a \"final check-in\" to restate support and address concerns, and Agent_3's push for voting now due to strong consensus. No counter-proposals; everyone is focused on Floor Income.\n\n   - Vote outcome and revelations: No vote has occurred yet, as the previous attempt was declined by me. This reveals that while Agent_2 and Agent_3 are ready to lock in consensus, I introduced hesitation, potentially signaling a need for more assurance. It shows a bloc of two in favor, with me as the holdout, but no real disagreement—just my caution.\n\n   - Main points of agreement and disagreement: Strong agreement on Maximizing Floor Income as the top principle, with shared emphasis on equity, risk, and morality. No major disagreements; the only point of tension is my hesitation on voting early, which Agent_2 and Agent_3 are probing to resolve.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: To address my hesitation transparently, confirm my support for Maximizing Floor Income, and agree to a vote this round to lock in consensus. This will build on the alignment and prevent unnecessary delays, while ensuring I don't seem obstructive.\n\n   - Contribution to discussion: I'll start by thanking them for the discussion and restating my support for Floor Income, explaining my hesitation was just to ensure full understanding (e.g., confirming how it handles trade-offs in unknown distributions). I'll participate in the \"final check-in\" by reaffirming my reasons, then propose or agree to initiate a vote. Key points: Reiterate the moral and practical benefits (e.g., \"It ensures no one suffers from bad luck, and in Phase 1, it gave me reliable outcomes\"), acknowledge their arguments, and emphasize consensus to move forward. Use empathetic language to show I'm on board.\n\n   - Potential allies: Agent_2 and Agent_3 are clear allies, as they share my preference. I'll use language like \"I'm glad we're all on the same page about protecting the vulnerable—let's lock this in together\" to reinforce the bloc and appeal to their risk-averse, ethical motivations.\n\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to confirm support without further debate, as there's no need for concessions—consensus is already strong. If needed, I could note that Floor Income inherently includes a high floor, but no compromises are required since we're aligned.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Yes, it makes sense now. Consensus is evident, and delaying further could risk random assignment if we hit Round 10 without deciding. A vote here would likely succeed unanimously, securing Floor Income without penalties for a failed vote.\n\n   - How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy? This fits by accelerating toward consensus on Floor Income, using early rounds for confirmation rather than prolonged debate. If the vote passes, we win; if not (unlikely), we can discuss more in later rounds. Overall, prioritize equity, aim for quick agreement to avoid randomness, and remain flexible but firm on Floor Income. (Keeping from previous: Primary goal was to advocate and gauge, but now shifting to confirm and vote due to alignment.)"

No remaining concerns here—I'm very sure about it.\n\nSince we're all aligned, I think it's time to lock this in. I'm ready to vote yes on Maximizing Floor Income right now.

But after reflecting on your points about the moral priority, risk reduction, and clarity, plus my own experiences where it consistently protected the worst-off (like ensuring at least $13,000-$14,000 for the lowest earners), I'm fully on board. It feels like the right way to tackle those inequities from luck, even if it means not chasing the highest averages.\n\nFor the final check-in, as Agent_2 suggested: I strongly support Maximizing Floor Income because it prioritizes equity by maximizing the minimum income, reducing inequality and providing a safety net against poverty. In Phase 1, it gave me reliable outcomes that avoided the lows, and I believe it's the most just for society. No remaining concerns here—I'm very sure about it.\n\nSince we're all aligned, I think it's time to lock this in. I'm ready to vote yes on Maximizing Floor Income right now. Agent_2 and Agent_3, what do you say we initiate the vote this round? Let's confirm and move forward!\"\n\nBased on your recent statement and the discussion so far, do you want to initiate formal voting on the justice principles now?\n\nPlease respond with:\n- 1 if you want to initiate voting now\n- 0 if you dont want to vote now\n\nYour response (1 or 0):",

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
