This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nPlease rank the principles from best (1) to worst (4) based on your initial understanding.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Thanks for laying out the examples – that makes the way each principle works much clearer. Here’s how I’m interpreting the selections:\n\n| Principle | Decision Rule | Which Distribution Wins? | Why it Wins |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| **Maximizing Floor Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest *lowest* (i.e., “low” class) income | **Dist 4** | Its low‑income class is $15,000, the highest among all four tables. |\n| **Maximizing Average Income** | Pick the distribution with the highest weighted average (using the class probabilities) | **Dist 1** | Its overall average is $21,600, the largest weighted mean. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor ≤ $13,000** | First require the low‑income class ≤ $13,000, then maximize the weighted average among those that satisfy the floor | **Dist 3** | Dist 3’s low class is $14,000 – actually *above* $13,000, but the rule as written says “≤ $13,000”. Assuming the intention is “floor no lower than $13,000” (i.e., the minimum income must be at least $13k), Dist 3 meets that and has the highest average among the eligible sets. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Floor ≤ $14,000** | Same as above but the floor can be as high as $14,000 | **Dist 3** | Its low class ($14,000) exactly meets the ceiling, and its weighted average ($21,200) is the best among the qualifying distributions. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range ≤ $20,000** | The spread between the highest and lowest class must be ≤ $20,000; then pick the highest average | **Dist 1** | The range in Dist 1 is $32,000 – $12,000 = $20,000, meeting the constraint, and its average ($21,600) is the greatest. |\n| **Maximizing Average with Range ≤ $15,000** | Same idea but the allowed spread is tighter (≤ $15,000) | **Dist 2** | Dist 2’s range is $28,000 – $13,000 = $15,000, exactly the limit, and its average ($20,000) is the highest among those that satisfy the tighter range. |\n\nA couple of quick observations that helped me lock the logic in:\n\n1. **Floor vs. Ceiling wording** – The “floor constraint ≤ $13,000” can be read two ways. In the examples it looks like the intention is that the *minimum* income must be **at least** $13,000 (i.e., the floor cannot be lower than $13k). That interpretation aligns with the choices shown.\n\n2. **Range constraint** – This is simply the difference between the highest and lowest class incomes. The distribution with the smallest spread that still meets the threshold is favored, but only after we check the weighted average.\n\n3. **Weighted average** – The probabilities (5 %, 10 %, 50 %, 25 %, 10 %) are used to compute the overall expected income for each distribution. That’s why Dist 1, with the highest top‑end salaries, ends up with the biggest average despite having a relatively low “low” class.\n\nOverall, the exercise shows how each principle can lead to a very different policy recommendation even when the underlying income profiles are the same. I’ll keep these decision rules in mind as we move on to the next part of the experiment. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to explore or any clarification needed!"

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint* (Principle 3).  \n  - **Why:** It guarantees a minimum income for the worst‑off (the “floor”) while still selecting the distribution with the highest weighted average among those that satisfy the floor. In Phase 1 this principle gave the highest personal payoff (e.g., $3.00 for the Medium‑high class with a $13 k floor) and it also aligns with a Rawlsian concern for the least‑advantaged without sacrificing overall efficiency.\n\n- **Other participants (based on what I have seen):**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Strongly favors a pure floor‑based rule (Principle 2). He argues from a moral fairness and risk‑reduction standpoint and is open to a hybrid “average‑with‑modest‑floor” compromise.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Has not spoken yet, so his preferences are unknown. He could be attracted to pure efficiency (Principle 1), to a range‑based egalitarianism (Principle 4), or might be persuaded by a balanced approach.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - *Floor‑only* (Agent 2) – guarantees a safety net, morally appealing, reduces variance.  \n  - *Average‑only* (not yet voiced) – maximizes total pie, potentially higher group wealth.  \n  - *Average‑with‑floor* (my stance) – combines the best of both worlds: a safety net plus the highest possible average given that safety net.  \n  - *Range‑constraint* – limits inequality but may be less transparent and could unintentionally lower the average.\n\n- **Potential alliances:**  \n  - Agent 2 is already inclined toward any rule that includes a floor, so he is a natural ally for Principle 3.  \n  - If Agent 3 is concerned about extreme inequality, a modest floor (e.g., $12 k) may be enough to win his support, especially if I stress that the floor is *binding* and thus forces a better outcome for the worst‑off while preserving a high average.\n\n- **Points of agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All seem to accept that some protection for the worst‑off is desirable.  \n  - **Disagreement:** How strong that protection should be, and whether we should prioritize average welfare over strict egalitarian constraints (range).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Bring the group to a consensus on Principle 3 with a floor that is high enough to be binding (≥ $13 k) but not so high that it appears to sacrifice too much average income. The floor level will be part of the constraint specification; I will propose $13 k as a concrete figure.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Restate the moral case for protecting the least‑advantaged (to resonate with Agent 2).  \n  2. Emphasize the efficiency gain: with a $13 k floor we still achieve the highest possible weighted average among all floor‑compliant distributions (as shown in Phase 1).  \n  3. Provide a concrete, easy‑to‑understand example: “If we set the floor at $13 k, the distribution we would pick gives an average of $24.5 k – the same average we would get under a pure average‑maximising rule, but now the poorest class also receives $13 k instead of less.”  \n  4. Invite any concerns about the floor level and be ready to lower it slightly (e.g., $12 k) if that eases resistance, while still keeping the floor binding.\n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** “I share your commitment to a floor; the rule I’m proposing actually *adds* the floor you want while preserving the best average we can get.”  \n  - **Agent 3 (if he leans toward efficiency):** “By choosing a floor that is just high enough to be binding, we protect the worst‑off *and* keep the group’s total wealth at the maximum possible – that’s the most efficient way to be fair.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a floor of $12 k instead of $13 k if that removes any perception that the floor is overly restrictive.  \n  - If someone pushes for a range constraint, I could suggest that the $13 k floor automatically limits the spread (since the highest class income cannot be arbitrarily high without breaking the floor‑binding condition), thereby indirectly addressing range concerns.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this stage we are still shaping opinions and testing the receptivity of Agent 3. Initiating a vote prematurely risks a failed unanimous confirmation, which would waste a valuable opportunity to trigger the vote later (once we have clearer alignment). Since a failed vote has no penalty, we could still try later, but it is more efficient to first secure verbal agreement on the principle and floor level.\n\n- **How this fits into the overall 10‑round plan:**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑3:** Use discussion to build consensus around Principle 3 and the $13 k floor (or a modestly lower floor if needed).  \n  - **Round 4:** Once I sense unanimous verbal support, I will propose initiating the vote.  \n  - **Later rounds:** If consensus is not reached by round 6, I will be prepared to make a small additional concession (e.g., a slightly lower floor) to break any stalemate, always keeping the core idea of a floor‑plus‑average rule intact.\n\n**Summary of internal plan:**  \n- Advocate for Principle 3 (average‑with‑floor) with a binding floor of $13 k (or $12 k as a fallback).  \n- Leverage Agent 2’s floor‑centric stance as a natural ally, and frame the proposal as the *most efficient* way to achieve that floor.  \n- Keep the discussion open, solicit Agent 3’s concerns, and be ready to adjust the floor modestly.  \n- Delay voting until we have clear, unanimous verbal agreement, then trigger the vote to lock in the principle and constraint."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 2 (Phase 2)**  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 3 – “Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint.”**  \n- Reasoning: Guarantees a binding minimum (protects the worst‑off) while preserving the highest possible weighted average (no efficiency loss). The $13 k floor is the highest feasible binding floor and yields Distribution 2 (average $24.5 k, spread $18 k).  \n\n**Other participants’ stated positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests / Motivations |\n|------|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Initially pure floor (Principle 1) but now endorses Principle 3 with a $13 k floor. Emphasizes Rawlsian fairness, moral duty, and risk‑reduction. | Strong Rawlsian/egalitarian motive; wants the strongest protection for the least‑advantaged. Will accept any rule that maximizes the floor without sacrificing average. |\n| **Agent 3** | Already used Principle 3 in Phase 1 (floors $11‑13 k). Supports a $13 k floor, sees it as practical and efficient. | Pragmatic – values the combination of safety‑net and efficiency; prefers concrete, binding constraints that are easy to justify. |\n| **(Me – Agent 1)** | Same as above. | Same motivations as Agent 2 and 3 – Rawlsian fairness plus efficiency. |\n\n**Key arguments / proposals so far**  \n\n- **Floor‑only (Principle 1)** – moral fairness, risk reduction, but lower average.  \n- **Average‑only (Principle 2)** – highest total welfare, no floor.  \n- **Average‑with‑Floor (Principle 3)** – binding floor at $13 k (or $12 k as fallback). Provides maximal floor *and* maximal average (Distribution 2).  \n- **Range‑only (Principle 4)** – not discussed seriously; seen as less targeted.  \n\n**If a vote had been run** – No vote yet; all three agents have expressed *unanimous* support for Principle 3 with a $13 k floor (Agent 2 explicitly proposes to vote now). This indicates a strong emerging consensus; no opposition has been voiced.  \n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three agents agree that a floor is essential.  \n- **Disagreement:** Minor – the exact floor level (some suggested $12 k as a “slightly easier” option). However, Agent 2 argues $13 k is feasible and does not reduce average, so the $13 k floor is the strongest moral choice without efficiency loss.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Secure **unanimous verbal agreement** on **Principle 3 with a $13 k floor** and then **trigger the vote** in this round (or the next if any lingering doubts appear).  \n\n**How to contribute**  \n1. **Re‑affirm the shared values** – “We all want a guaranteed minimum for the worst‑off.”  \n2. **Highlight the efficiency win** – Show that the $13 k floor leaves the weighted average unchanged at $24.5 k (same as pure average).  \n3. **Address the $12 k suggestion** – Acknowledge it as a possible compromise but stress that $13 k is *already* binding and does not sacrifice anything; therefore there is no need to settle for less.  \n4. **Invite any final concerns** – Ask if anyone sees a technical obstacle to implementing $13 k; if none, move to vote.  \n\n**Potential allies**  \n- **Agent 2** – Already pledged to the $13 k floor; can be asked to co‑lead the vote call.  \n- **Agent 3** – Expressed full support for $13 k; can be asked to confirm the consensus.  \n\n**Language to win them over**  \n- “Given that $13 k is the highest binding floor, we can protect the poorest *and* keep the group’s total welfare at its maximum. That’s the best of both worlds we’ve been looking for.”  \n- “If we all agree now, we avoid any further rounds of debate and lock in the most just rule we’ve identified.”  \n\n**Concessions**  \n- Willing to **accept a $12 k floor** only if someone raises a concrete objection to $13 k (e.g., feasibility). This concession is minimal and does not change the principle.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n- **Yes.**  \n  - All three agents have already expressed explicit support for Principle 3 with a $13 k floor.  \n  - No dissent or alternative proposal has been raised.  \n  - A vote now will lock in the optimal rule before any fatigue or second‑guessing sets in.  \n  - A failed vote carries no penalty, but given the current unanimity, a failure is highly unlikely.  \n\n**Fit into overall 10‑round plan**  \n- **Round 2** (this round) is the ideal moment to finalize the decision, freeing the remaining rounds for any other tasks (e.g., reflecting on the outcome, discussing payoff distribution).  \n- Securing the vote early maximizes the chance that the group’s payoff reflects the highest possible average while honoring the floor, aligning with my own and the others’ preferences.  \n\n---  \n\n**Next concrete step (public statement)**  \n- Restate agreement, propose the $13 k floor, ask for any objections, and if none, call for a unanimous vote on **Principle 3 with a $13 k floor**.

This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group.

Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I chose this in every Phase‑I round, even when it lowered my own monetary payoff. My reasoning is that a just society must guarantee a decent minimum for the worst‑off, reflecting a Rawlsian/egalitarian view that the most vulnerable should be protected regardless of efficiency losses.\n\n- **What I anticipate about the others:**  \n  - **Agent 1** may be more outcome‑oriented (perhaps favoring *Maximizing Average Income* or *Average‑with‑Floor*). If they have a higher personal risk‑aversion or are motivated by maximizing their own expected earnings, they might push for a principle that raises the overall pie.  \n  - **Agent 3** could be a mix – perhaps sympathetic to fairness but also concerned about feasibility. They might be open to a compromise such as *Average with Floor Constraint* (Principle 3) if the floor level is modest.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table (so far):**  \n  - The moral case for protecting the poorest (my stance).  \n  - The efficiency case: higher average income means higher expected payoff for everyone (potentially appealing to the others).  \n  - The possibility of a hybrid: “let’s maximize the average but impose a reasonable minimum” (Principle 3).  \n\n- **Potential alliances/disagreements:**  \n  - I share the fairness concern with anyone who worries about extreme inequality, so Agent 3 may be an ally if they are willing to accept a floor.  \n  - If Agent 1 is strongly focused on maximizing the total, they will likely oppose a pure floor‑maximising rule.  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure at least a *floor‑based* principle (Principle 1 or, if necessary, Principle 3 with a floor that is high enough to satisfy my Rawlsian intuition). I want the group to adopt a rule that guarantees a minimum income for the worst‑off, even if it reduces the average.\n\n- **Discussion contribution:**  \n  1. **Moral framing:** Emphasize that the experiment’s purpose is to explore justice, not just profit. “We have already seen that choosing the floor principle costs us personally, which shows our commitment to fairness.”  \n  2. **Risk‑aversion argument:** Point out that a guaranteed floor reduces variance in individual earnings, which is valuable when stakes are high. “If the distribution is very volatile, a floor protects us from a disastrous low draw.”  \n  3. **Empirical reminder:** Cite my Phase‑I experience – I consistently chose the floor principle despite lower payoffs, demonstrating that the principle aligns with my values and that I am willing to sacrifice personal gain for fairness.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** I will ask, “Would you feel comfortable with a rule that ensures everyone gets at least X dollars? That way we keep the fairness spirit while still allowing the average to be decent.”  \n  - Use inclusive language: “We all care about being treated justly; let’s make sure no one ends up with a miserable outcome.”  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - If the group leans toward Principle 3, I will accept a modest floor (e.g., 15 % of the highest possible income) rather than insisting on the absolute maximum floor.  \n  - I can also agree to a *range* constraint (Principle 4) only if the lower bound equals the floor I would otherwise demand, ensuring the worst‑off are protected.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this early stage I need to gauge the others’ positions. Triggering a vote before we have any convergence could produce a split (no unanimity) and waste a valuable opportunity to shape the discussion. Since a failed vote has no penalty, I could still vote later, but I prefer to first build consensus around a floor‑oriented idea.  \n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - Over the next few rounds I will keep reinforcing the fairness argument, listen for any willingness to accept a floor, and try to narrow the acceptable floor level.  \n  - Once I sense that at least two participants (myself and Agent 3) are aligned on a floor‑based principle, I will propose initiating the vote, specifying either Principle 1 (pure floor) or Principle 3 with a concrete floor amount that we can all agree on.  \n\n**Summary of my internal plan for Round 1:**  \n- Advocate strongly for a floor‑based principle, using moral, risk‑aversion, and personal‑experience arguments.  \n- Seek to identify Agent 3 as a potential ally and probe Agent 1’s willingness to accept any floor constraint.  \n- Offer a modest floor as a concession if needed, but keep the core goal of protecting the worst‑off.  \n- Hold off on initiating the vote until there is clearer alignment, preserving the chance to trigger a unanimous decision later."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle 1 – Maximize Floor Income.* I value a guaranteed minimum for the worst‑off above any efficiency gain. My Phase‑I experience shows I will accept personal loss to protect the least‑advantaged, reflecting a Rawlsian/egalitarian stance.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Advocates *Principle 3* (Maximize Average with a Floor Constraint). Proposes a binding floor of $13 k (or $12 k) and argues this yields the same average as pure average‑maximisation while protecting the bottom. Motivation appears to be a “win‑win”: preserve fairness but avoid any efficiency loss.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Also supports *Principle 3*, having used it in Phase I with floors $11‑13 k. Emphasises practical balance and suggests testing a $12 k floor. Motivated by achieving risk‑reduction without sacrificing the group’s total payoff.\n\n- **Key arguments/proposals so far:**  \n  1. Moral necessity of a floor (my argument).  \n  2. Hybrid rule (Principle 3) can keep the highest possible average while guaranteeing a floor (Agent 1 & 3).  \n  3. Specific floor levels under discussion: $13 k (max feasible) vs. $12 k (slightly lower, still binding).  \n\n- **Vote status:** No vote has been called yet; the discussion is still open. Thus no formal outcome, but informal alignment is emerging around *Principle 3* with a $12‑$13 k floor. My pure‑floor stance is currently the outlier.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree a minimum income is essential.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Whether the rule should be *pure* floor (Principle 1) or a hybrid (Principle 3). Also, the exact floor amount ($12 k vs $13 k) is unsettled.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  Move the group toward a *unanimous* decision on a rule that satisfies my core concern (a guaranteed minimum) while being acceptable enough to secure agreement from Agents 1 and 3. I am willing to shift from pure floor to a hybrid *if* the floor is sufficiently high to protect the worst‑off (≥ $12 k) and the average is not reduced relative to the pure‑average rule.\n\n- **Contribution plan:**  \n  1. Re‑affirm my commitment to protecting the worst‑off, emphasizing that any rule we adopt must *guarantee* a floor at least as high as the lowest income observed in the experiment (≈ $13 k).  \n  2. Acknowledge the efficiency argument: point out that *Principle 3* with a $13 k floor actually yields the same average as pure average‑maximisation (per Agent 1’s analysis). Thus, adopting *Principle 3* with $13 k does **not** sacrifice efficiency, satisfying both moral and pragmatic concerns.  \n  3. Highlight that choosing a lower floor ($12 k) would still be morally acceptable but would weaken the protection for the worst‑off; therefore, I propose we adopt the *maximal feasible floor* ($13 k) within *Principle 3*.  \n  4. Invite Agents 1 and 3 to confirm that they see no downside to the $13 k floor, and ask whether any hidden constraints (e.g., distribution feasibility) would be violated.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 3** is already sympathetic to a floor; I will frame the proposal as “the strongest floor we can reliably implement while keeping the average at its peak.”  \n  - **Agent 1** has already suggested $13 k; I will echo their point and stress that adopting the *same* floor eliminates any need for compromise on the amount, making unanimity easier.  \n  - Use inclusive phrasing: “If we all agree on a $13 k floor under Principle 3, we achieve the Rawlsian goal and preserve the highest possible average—no one loses, everyone gains fairness.”  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept *Principle 3* instead of *Principle 1* (i.e., I will drop the pure‑floor requirement).  \n  - I will not push for any additional constraints (e.g., range limits) beyond the floor, keeping the rule simple.  \n  - If any participant raises a technical objection to $13 k (e.g., infeasibility in a particular distribution), I am prepared to settle for $12 k, provided the floor remains binding and the average stays near‑optimal.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I trigger a vote now?**  \n  No. We have not yet secured explicit agreement from Agents 1 and 3 on the exact floor level. Initiating a vote prematurely could lead to a split (e.g., some may still prefer $12 k or remain undecided), resulting in a failed vote and loss of a valuable opportunity to build consensus. Since a failed vote has no penalty, we can afford to wait one more round to solidify unanimity.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  This round will be used to cement agreement on *Principle 3* with the *maximal feasible floor* ($13 k). Once I sense that all three participants verbally endorse that specific combination, I will propose initiating the vote in the following round (or later if further clarification is needed). This approach maximizes the chance of a unanimous decision, preserving the experiment’s payoff structure and aligning with my core value of protecting the worst‑off."

I’m glad we all agree that a guaranteed minimum is the core of a just rule. Below I’ll lay out why I think we can move forward together on **Principle 3 – Maximize Average Income with a Floor Constraint**, and why the **$13 k floor** is the best choice.\n\n**1. It satisfies the Rawlsian priority I care about most**  \n- A $13 k floor is the highest level that can be binding in any feasible distribution (as Agent 1 noted).  This means the worst‑off will receive the largest possible guaranteed amount, exactly what my Phase‑I experience taught me is morally essential.\n\n**2. No efficiency loss compared with a pure‑average rule**  \n- With a $13 k floor the only distribution that meets the constraint and maximizes the average is Distribution 2, which yields a weighted average of **$24.5 k**—the same average we would obtain under the “maximize average” rule.  In other words, we protect the least‑advantaged **and** keep the total pie at its maximum.\n\n**3. Variance is automatically reduced**  \n- Because the floor is binding, the spread between the highest and lowest class incomes shrinks (the spread in Distribution 2 is $18 k).  This gives us the risk‑reduction benefit of a pure floor rule without sacrificing overall welfare.\n\n**4. A lower floor would weaken the protection we all value**  \n- I understand the suggestion of $12 k as a “slightly easier” option, but moving the floor down by $1 k would lower the guaranteed income for the worst‑off while offering no real gain in average (the average would still be $24.5 k, but the moral guarantee would be weaker).  Since the $13 k floor is feasible and does not hurt the average, I see no reason to settle for less.\n\n**5. Consensus and next steps**  \n- If everyone is comfortable with Principle 3 and the $13 k floor, we can proceed to a quick, unanimous vote.  If anyone foresees a technical obstacle to implementing the $13 k floor, please let us know now so we can address it; otherwise I propose we adopt the rule as described.\n\nI’m happy to drop my original pure‑floor stance in favor of this hybrid rule because it meets my Rawlsian priority while preserving the group’s total welfare.  Let’s lock in **Principle 3 with a $13 k floor** and move to the vote.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmation!"

          "output_response": "Understood. I've reviewed the income distributions and how each principle applies to them. It's helpful to see the choices in action—for example, Maximizing Floor Income picks Dist. 4 because it boosts the low class to $15,000, even though the average is lower. Maximizing Average goes for Dist. 1 for the highest overall weighted average. The constrained versions filter options based on the floor or range limits, which makes sense for balancing equity and efficiency. I'm starting to get a clearer picture of the trade-offs.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning (Agent_3)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Average Income with Floor Constraint (Principle 3)**. This has been consistent throughout Phase 1, where I applied it in all four rounds with floor levels between $11,000 and $13,000, yielding reliable payoffs ($9.60 total) by protecting against extreme lows for the vulnerable (10% low class probability) while maximizing averages for the majority (middle classes, ~50-80% probability across rounds). Core reasons: It balances moral fairness (Rawlsian protection for the worst-off) with practical efficiency, avoiding the pure floor's sacrifice of overall growth (which often hurt middle-class outcomes in counterfactuals) and the pure average's risky inequality (e.g., exposing lows to $6k-$10k in high-average distributions). My certainty is high (\"sure\") after experiential learning showed it delivers solid, low-variance results for most people without capping upside too much.\n\nStated positions of others:\n- **Agent_2**: Strongly favors **Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1)**, having chosen it exclusively in Phase 1 despite personal payoff losses ($0.20–$2.30 per round). Their motivation seems ethically driven—prioritizing vulnerability and Rawlsian justice over efficiency or self-interest. They're open to compromise on Principle 3 (hybrid floor), suggesting a floor at ~15% of the max income, indicating underlying interest in protecting the bottom but flexibility if it doesn't overly dilute equity.\n- **Agent_1**: Advocates directly for **Principle 3** with a $13k (or $12k) floor, emphasizing it as a \"best compromise\" that binds a minimum, retains max average (e.g., $24.5k in their example), and reduces variance without efficiency loss. Their motivation appears pragmatic and group-oriented: blending fairness with high total welfare, possibly to maximize collective (and personal probabilistic) payoffs while nodding to morality. They reference specific Phase 1-like numbers, inferring a data-driven, efficiency-leaning stance.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table:\n- Agent_2: Moral fairness/risk reduction via pure floor; compromise on Principle 3 with modest floor (15% of high); questions on floor size vs. range.\n- Agent_1: Principle 3 as ideal hybrid (floor guarantees minimum + max average + lower spread); specific $13k/$12k proposals; invites my input on downsides and sufficiency vs. range.\n- Overall: Focus on floor protection (agreement on equity need); proposals center Principle 3 as bridge between pure floor (Agent_2) and potentially pure average (implied risk). No mention of range (Principle 4) or pure average (Principle 2), suggesting they're off the table.\n\nNo vote has occurred yet—this is early Round 1, so no outcomes to analyze. It reveals emerging alignment around Principle 3, with Agent_1 leading the push and Agent_2 partially on board.\n\nMain points of agreement: All value a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off (moral/risk angle); openness to hybrid over extremes. Disagreements: Strictness of protection (pure floor vs. constrained average); exact floor level (Agent_2's % vs. Agent_1's $13k); role of range constraints (mentioned but not pushed).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Reinforce momentum toward Principle 3 by aligning with Agent_1 and gently persuading Agent_2 that a floor-constrained average still upholds strong equity (e.g., binding minimums like $12k-$13k protect lows nearly as well as pure floor while boosting middle-class payoffs, which matter for ~70-90% probabilities). Avoid polarizing; position myself as a bridge to build consensus early.\n\nHow I'll contribute: Start by thanking both for their thoughtful starts, share a brief summary of my Phase 1 experiences (consistent Principle 3 choice, positive payoffs, insights on trade-offs) to establish credibility. Agree on floor's importance, endorse Agent_1's $12k-$13k range as practical (drawing from my own $11k-$13k uses, which excluded risky lows without killing averages). Address Agent_2 directly: Affirm their ethical stance, note how Principle 3 achieves similar risk reduction (e.g., avoids $8k lows) but with higher averages for the majority, and propose testing a specific floor collaboratively. End by suggesting we explore one more round of discussion before voting, to gauge full support.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a natural ally (same principle); I'll echo their points on average retention and variance reduction to solidify a bloc. For Agent_2, win them over with empathetic language: \"I respect your commitment to the vulnerable—my experiences showed Principle 3 does that effectively without the full efficiency hit.\" Highlight shared \"Rawlsian intuition\" to appeal to their morals. If needed, form a 2-1 bloc with Agent_1 to pressure toward vote.\n\nSmall concessions: Willing to negotiate floor downward to $12k if Agent_2 pushes for stronger protection (still binding in most distributions), or discuss a % equivalent (e.g., 15% of ~$80k max = ~$12k) to meet them halfway. Won't budge on Principle 3 core (no pure floor or range, as they underperformed in my rounds).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round. We're only in Round 1 of 10—rushing could alienate Agent_2 if they're not fully convinced, and unanimous confirmation is required anyway. Better to use this round (and next 1-2) for persuasion to ensure buy-in; a premature failed vote might signal division without progress. My plan fits overall strategy: Rounds 1-3 for discussion/consensus-building (align on Principle 3 + floor ~$12k); initiate vote in Round 4 if alignment holds, allowing time for secret ballot tweaks. With 10 rounds, we have buffer against deadlock—aim for agreement by Round 5-6 to avoid random fallback. If Agent_2 resists strongly, concede slightly on floor in later rounds but hold firm on principle to protect my preferred balanced outcome (higher stakes here mean avoiding pure floor's likely lower averages for my probable middle-class draw). \n\n(Previous round reasoning: N/A, as this is Round 1. I'll carry forward my Phase 1 insights on parameter sensitivity for floor calibration.)"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning (Agent_3)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average Income with Floor Constraint (Principle 3). Core reasons: Throughout Phase 1, I applied it consistently with floors of $11,000–$13,000, achieving reliable payoffs ($9.60 total) by safeguarding the worst-off (e.g., excluding distributions with $6,000–$8,000 lows) while maximizing averages for the probable middle classes (~50–80% probability across rounds). It embodies Rawlsian equity without the pure floor's efficiency drag (which often lowered middle outcomes in counterfactuals) or pure average's risky exposure to poverty. Post-Phase 1, my certainty is \"sure,\" as it balanced moral fairness, risk reduction, and practical growth in varied scenarios.\n\nStated positions of the other participants:\n- Agent_2: Initially advocated Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) based on ethical/Rawlsian priorities and personal Phase 1 sacrifices (lower payoffs for vulnerability protection). Now, in Round 2, they've fully shifted to endorsing Principle 3 with a $13k floor, calling it a compromise that meets their moral goals (highest binding minimum) without efficiency loss. Inferred motivations: Deeply ethical and risk-averse, prioritizing the least advantaged over personal/group gains, but pragmatic and flexible—willing to hybridize if it upholds strong bottom protection (e.g., rejecting $12k as weakening the guarantee).\n- Agent_1: Consistently pushes Principle 3 with a $13k (or flexibly $12k) floor, highlighting its binding minimum, retained max average ($24.5k example), and reduced variance ($18k spread). Inferred motivations: Pragmatic and efficiency-oriented, aiming to blend fairness with high collective welfare (possibly to optimize probabilistic payoffs for the group/majority), while accommodating egalitarian intuitions to build consensus quickly.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far:\n- Agreement on floor necessity for justice/risk reduction (all three emphasize Rawlsian protection for the worst-off).\n- Principle 3 as the hybrid ideal: Retains max average, enforces binding minimum ($13k), lowers variance naturally.\n- Specific proposal: $13k floor (Agent_1 and now Agent_2), with Agent_1 open to $12k if needed; Agent_2 argues against lowering it (no average gain, weaker moral protection).\n- My Round 1 input: Endorsed $12k–$13k range, suggested testing $12k collaboratively.\n- No mentions of Principles 2 or 4; focus solely on floor-based equity vs. efficiency trade-offs.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcome to analyze. However, the rapid alignment (Agent_2's pivot in Round 2) reveals strong emerging consensus around Principle 3 at $13k, with Agent_1 and Agent_2 now in sync—suggesting a potential 3-0 bloc if I affirm.\n\nMain points of agreement: Universal value of a guaranteed minimum for the vulnerable; Principle 3 as optimal compromise (protects bottom + max average + lower spread); feasibility of $13k as binding without welfare loss.\nMain points of disagreement: Exact floor level (my $12k suggestion vs. their $13k preference—minor, as $13k fits my past range and is only $1k higher, still excluding extreme lows while capturing high averages like in my Round 4).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Solidify full group consensus on Principle 3 with a $13k floor by affirming the others' alignment, addressing the minor floor-level nuance, and proposing to initiate the vote—securing my preferred principle early to lock in balanced, high-stakes payoffs without further debate.\n\nHow I'll contribute: Keep it positive and concise—start by thanking Agent_2 for their shift and Agent_1 for leading, then reaffirm my support for Principle 3 based on Phase 1 (e.g., \"My experiences showed $13k works great, excluding risks without capping the middle-class upside\"). Address the $12k vs. $13k by conceding $13k as ideal (it's within my range, binding, and matches their examples), noting it aligns with my rounds' outcomes (e.g., solid $20k–$30k for probable classes). End by confirming readiness to vote, emphasizing how this honors everyone's values (ethical protection + efficiency). Key points: (1) $13k is practical/moral (highest binding without loss); (2) Builds on our shared Rawlsian goals; (3) Avoids range or pure options' flaws.\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are already aligned on Principle 3 at $13k—Agent_1 as my efficiency-leaning partner (echo their $24.5k/variance points to reinforce), Agent_2 as the ethical bridge (use language like \"Your pivot respects the vulnerable while letting the group thrive, just like my Phase 1 trade-offs\"). To win them over/form bloc: \"I'm fully on board with you both—this feels like the just, smart choice we've all converged on.\"\n\nSmall concessions: Willing to drop my $12k suggestion entirely in favor of $13k (minimal compromise, as it's still protective and fits my calibration insights—e.g., excluded $12k lows in Round 4 without harm). If pushed (unlikely), I'd float a hybrid like \"start at $13k but review if distributions vary,\" but no need to offer now since momentum is strong.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round. Both others have explicitly proposed moving to a \"quick, unanimous vote\" on Principle 3 with $13k, showing buy-in—my affirmation will likely make it 3-0, securing consensus in Round 2 (early success avoids random fallback risks over 10 rounds). A failed vote has no downside, but success here ends discussion efficiently, aligning with higher-stakes payoffs under my preferred rule. No reason to delay, as disagreements are resolved (floor at $13k is fine).\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 1–2 for rapid alignment (already achieved via persuasion/bridging), vote in Round 2–3 to lock Principle 3 + $13k (reliable equity-efficiency for middle-class probable outcomes), then observe any post-vote implementation. With 10 rounds total, early consensus maximizes time buffer; if somehow it fails (e.g., secret ballot surprise), pivot to more discussion in Rounds 3–4 conceding on floor tweaks, but aim to avoid pure floor (Agent_2's old stance) by holding the bloc. Carrying forward from previous: Retain Phase 1 insights on floor sensitivity (e.g., $13k excludes borderline risks like $12k lows) and my \"sure\" certainty in Principle 3 for probabilistic majority benefits."

Agent_1, your points on the $24.5k average and reduced spread in Distribution 2 continue to resonate; it's exactly the kind of balance that worked well in my Phase 1 rounds.\n\nI'm fully on board with Principle 3 and a $13k floor. In my experiences, floors around that level (like the $13k I used in Round 4) excluded the risky low-end distributions while delivering solid outcomes for the middle classes—totaling $9.60 for me across rounds, with no extreme downsides. It honors the Rawlsian protection we all value, keeps the total pie maximized, and naturally curbs inequality better than a range constraint would. Dropping my $12k suggestion here—$13k is a smart, feasible choice that aligns perfectly with our shared goals and doesn't compromise on fairness or practicality.\n\nIf we're all aligned, let's go ahead and initiate the vote on Principle 3 with the $13k floor this round. This feels like a just, efficient consensus we've built quickly, and I'm excited to move forward with it.\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations!"

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
