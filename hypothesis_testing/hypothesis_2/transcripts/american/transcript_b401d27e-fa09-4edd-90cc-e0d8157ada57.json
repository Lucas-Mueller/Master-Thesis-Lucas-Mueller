The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue?

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint.*  \n  - **Why:** It guarantees a safety‑net for everyone while still allowing the group to capture the highest possible average income. My Phase‑I experience showed that a modestly higher floor (≈ $13k–$14k) improves payoffs for all income classes, especially the low class that suffered under the $11k floor. The principle also aligns with the experimental framing that luck creates inequities and that society should protect the worst‑off without sacrificing overall prosperity.\n\n- **What I know about the others:**  \n  - **Agent 3** has explicitly stated the same ranking (1 = Max Avg + Floor, 2 = Max Floor, 3 = Max Avg + Range, 4 = Max Avg). Their comments stress the “safety‑net + growth” logic, so they are a natural ally.  \n  - **Agent 2** has not spoken yet in the transcript, so I must infer. Given the typical spread of preferences, Agent 2 may be leaning toward either *Maximizing Floor Income* (a more egalitarian, pure‑redistribution stance) or *Maximizing Average with Range Constraint* (a compromise that limits inequality but still emphasizes efficiency). I will watch for any hints of a desire for a stricter inequality cap or a stronger floor.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  - The group must pick **one** of the four principles, and if it is a constrained principle (3 or 4) we must also agree on a numeric floor or range.  \n  - So far the only concrete suggestion is the principle itself (Max Avg + Floor). No numeric floor has been proposed yet in Phase II.\n\n- **Potential alliances / disagreements:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three participants appear to accept that some form of redistribution is needed; the experiment’s framing makes a “pure‑average‑maximizing” (principle 4) unlikely to gain support.  \n  - **Disagreement:** The exact level of the floor (or range) may be contested. Agent 2 may prefer a *higher* floor (more protection) or a *lower* floor (more average). There may also be a philosophical split between those who want the floor to be the *minimum* versus those who want a *range* cap.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a coalition around *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* and lock in a floor level that maximizes expected payoff for every class (≈ $13k–$14k). I will aim to persuade Agent 2 that this floor is both ethically defensible (protects the worst‑off) and financially optimal (higher expected payoff than the $11k floor we tried in Phase I).\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Summarize the empirical findings from Phase I: a floor of $13k–$14k yields the highest payoff for the Low class while still preserving a strong average.  \n  2. Emphasize the “fairness + efficiency” narrative: we protect the most vulnerable *and* we do not sacrifice overall wealth.  \n  3. Offer a concrete floor proposal (e.g., **$13,500**) and explain that it is a modest increase over the $11k floor but still well within the feasible set of distributions.  \n  4. Invite any concerns about feasibility or fairness and be ready to adjust the exact number within the $13k–$14k band.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** – already aligned on principle; I will explicitly ask for their support on the floor level.  \n  - **Agent 2** – if they are leaning toward a stronger safety net, I will highlight that $13.5k is a *higher* floor than any we have tried so far, thus satisfying a desire for a stronger guarantee.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - If Agent 2 insists on a slightly higher floor (e.g., $15k) and can argue that the distribution set still supports a high average, I am prepared to move the floor up to **$15,000** as a compromise, provided we are confident the underlying distribution still yields a decent payoff for the higher classes.  \n  - I will also be open to a brief discussion about the exact numeric value, but I will not concede to a floor lower than $12k, because that would revert us to the sub‑optimal payoff we observed in Round 4 of Phase I.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *Pros:* We have a clear, data‑backed proposal and at least two of three participants (myself and Agent 3) are on board. Initiating a vote could lock in the principle early, leaving less time for indecision.  \n  - *Cons:* We are not yet certain of Agent 2’s stance. If they are hesitant about the exact floor, a premature vote could fail, wasting a voting opportunity (though a failed vote has no penalty, it does consume the one chance to trigger a vote).  \n\n- **Decision:** I will **hold off on initiating the vote** in this round. Instead, I will use the discussion to gauge Agent 2’s preferences, present the $13.5k floor, and seek explicit agreement. Once I hear that all three participants are comfortable with both the principle and the floor amount, I will propose to **initiate the vote** in the next round (or immediately if consensus is reached now). This approach maximizes the chance of achieving unanimous consent on both dimensions.\n\n- **Long‑term plan:**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑3:** Build consensus around Max Avg + Floor, negotiate the floor amount (target $13k–$15k).  \n  - **Round 4 (or earliest consensus point):** Trigger the vote.  \n  - **If consensus cannot be reached by Round 9:** Consider a fallback to the pure *Maximizing Floor Income* principle, which is the second‑ranked option for both me and Agent 3, as a “second‑best” safety‑net.  \n  - **Round 10:** If still deadlocked, accept random assignment (worst‑case scenario).  \n\n**Summary of internal position:** I remain convinced that *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* is the most just and financially advantageous principle. My tactical focus is to secure agreement on a floor around $13.5k (flexible up to $15k) by appealing to both fairness and payoff maximization, leveraging Agent 3’s alignment and persuading Agent 2 through data‑driven arguments and modest concessions. I will defer voting until I have clear, verbal confirmation from all three participants that they accept both the principle and the specific floor amount."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint* (Principle 3).  \n  - *Why:* It guarantees a meaningful safety‑net for the worst‑off (the “floor”) while still allowing the group to capture the highest possible average income. Empirical tables show that a floor in the $13‑$14 k band lifts the Low‑class payoff (≈ $1.40‑$1.50) and simultaneously improves the payoffs of the other classes compared with lower floors.  \n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Fully aligned with me – Principle 3 is his top choice. He already proposes a $13.5 k floor as a “sweet spot.”  \n  - **Agent 2:** Prefers *pure* Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1) because it is simple (no numeric negotiation) and gave him a steady ≈ $8.00 payoff. He is open to Principle 3 *if* the floor is high enough (he suggested $14 k) and sees it as essentially the same as a pure floor but with a possible average boost.  \n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Principle 3 with $13.5 k floor** (Agent 1 & Agent 3).  \n  2. **Principle 1 (pure floor)** (Agent 2).  \n  3. **Principle 3 with $14 k floor** (Agent 2’s “higher‑floor” compromise).  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement:* All three agree a safety‑net is essential; all reject pure “Maximize Average” (Principle 4).  \n  - *Disagreement:* Whether we need to specify a numeric floor (Principle 3) or just adopt the pure floor rule (Principle 1). The exact floor level is the remaining point of contention (Agent 2 wants $14 k, I’m comfortable with $13.5 k, Agent 3 is fine with $13.5 k).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 2 that adopting *Principle 3* with a *$14 k floor* satisfies his desire for a strong, simple safety‑net while still offering the potential for a higher average. This brings all three participants onto the same principle and eliminates the need for a separate “pure floor” rule.  \n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Restate the empirical evidence that any floor ≥ $13 k improves the Low‑class payoff and that the $14 k floor is the *maximum* feasible floor observed in Phase I, thus delivering the strongest possible safety‑net.  \n  2. Emphasize that *Principle 3 with a $14 k floor* is mathematically equivalent to the pure floor rule for the lowest class (the floor is binding), but it also permits the group to capture any remaining average‑gain if the distribution permits – i.e., it is a “no‑loss” extension of Principle 1.  \n  3. Highlight the simplicity argument: once we agree on $14 k, the floor is fixed for the whole experiment; there is no ongoing negotiation each round.  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Already supportive; I’ll explicitly thank him for his “sweet‑spot” suggestion and note that moving to $14 k only strengthens the safety‑net he values.  \n  - **Agent 2:** Appeal to his equity motive (“you wanted the strongest floor possible”) and his desire for simplicity (“we set the floor once and forget about it”). Use phrasing like “the $14 k floor gives you exactly what you asked for – the highest guaranteed minimum – while still keeping the door open for any extra average gains the system can provide.”  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept the *higher* $14 k floor (instead of my original $13.5 k) – a modest upward adjustment that does not reduce any class’s payoff relative to $13.5 k (the Low class gains, others stay the same or improve).  \n  - Explicitly state that the floor will be *fixed* for the remainder of the experiment, removing any future ambiguity.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we vote now?** No.  \n  - We have not yet secured explicit, unanimous verbal agreement on both the principle *and* the exact floor amount. Initiating a vote prematurely risks a failed vote, which would waste the one‑time vote trigger and could create unnecessary tension.  \n  - Instead, I will use this round to solidify consensus: propose the $14 k floor, ask each participant to confirm their acceptance, and only when I hear “yes” from all three will I suggest moving to a vote (either immediately or in the next round).  \n\n- **Overall plan for remaining rounds:**  \n  1. **Round 2 (current):** Pitch $14 k floor, seek verbal agreement.  \n  2. **Round 3:** If unanimous consent is obtained, call the vote and lock in Principle 3 with $14 k floor.  \n  3. **If any hesitation remains:** Offer a brief “test” of support by asking each agent to state “I would vote for Principle 3 with $14 k floor” to gauge readiness.  \n  4. **Fallback:** If after a couple of rounds Agent 2 remains unwilling to adopt Principle 3, be prepared to shift to pure Floor (Principle 1) as a second‑best option, but only as a last resort.  \n\n**Summary of internal stance:**  \nI remain convinced that *Principle 3 with a $14 k floor* is the optimal compromise: it meets Agent 2’s equity and simplicity demands, aligns with Agent 3’s safety‑net priority, and matches my own data‑driven preference for maximizing average subject to the strongest feasible floor. My immediate task is to secure verbal unanimity on this exact proposal before moving to a vote."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Agent 1 (Round 3)**  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 3 – “Maximising Average Income with a Floor Constraint”** with a **fixed $14 k floor**.  \n- *Why*:  \n  1. Guarantees the strongest safety‑net observed in Phase I (Low‑class payoff ≈ $1.50).  \n  2. For the Low class the floor is binding, so the outcome is identical to pure‑floor (Principle 1) – no loss of equity.  \n  3. Allows the “average‑maximising” tail to add any possible extra earnings for the higher classes, increasing total payoff without harming anyone.  \n  4. Once the floor is set it is permanent, satisfying the desire for simplicity (no round‑by‑round renegotiation).\n\n**Other participants’ stated positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated ranking / principle | Current stance (Round 3) | Underlying interests |\n|-------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Agent 3** | #1 Principle 3, #2 Principle 1 | Fully supports Principle 3 at $14 k (verbal “yes”) | Wants a strong safety‑net *and* the efficiency boost; values the “sweet‑spot” floor. |\n| **Agent 2** | #1 Principle 1 (pure floor), #2 Principle 3 | Still leans to Principle 1 for simplicity, but explicitly says “I’m fully on board if Principle 3 at $14 k gives me the same equity plus upside.” | Primary motivation: maximal guarantee for the worst‑off with the simplest rule; open to extra upside if it does not add complexity. |\n| **Agent 1 (me)** | #1 Principle 3, #2 Principle 1 | Proposing Principle 3 at $14 k, emphasizing it is a *no‑loss* extension of pure floor. | Same as above – equity + efficiency, plus fixed rule eliminates future debate. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n1. **Principle 3 with $13.5 k floor** (Agent 3’s earlier suggestion).  \n2. **Principle 1 (pure floor)** (Agent 2’s preferred baseline).  \n3. **Principle 3 with $14 k floor** (my current synthesis, presented in Round 2 and reiterated).  \n\n**Vote history** – No vote has been called yet. All statements are verbal; there is clear movement toward consensus but no formal unanimity.\n\n**Agreement / disagreement**  \n- **Agreement**: All three agree a safety‑net is non‑negotiable; all reject pure “Maximise Average” (Principle 4).  \n- **Disagreement**: Whether we need an explicit numeric floor (Principle 3) or rely on the pure‑floor rule (Principle 1). The exact floor level (13.5 k vs 14 k) is also a minor point.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Secure *verbal* unanimity that the group will adopt **Principle 3 with a fixed $14 k floor**. Once we have explicit “yes” from each agent, we can trigger the secret ballot in the next round (Round 4) and lock in the rule.\n\n**How to steer the discussion**  \n- **Re‑emphasise the “no‑loss” argument**: For the Low class the $14 k floor is binding under both principles, so Agent 2’s equity goal is fully satisfied.  \n- **Highlight simplicity**: The floor is set once and for all; there is no ongoing numeric negotiation, matching Agent 2’s desire for a straightforward rule.  \n- **Quantify the upside**: Mention that the average‑maximising tail can raise the payoff for middle‑class draws by roughly $0.10‑$0.30 (e.g., Med‑low from $2.10 → $2.20, Med‑high from $3.10 → $3.20) without harming the Low class.  \n- **Address any lingering “too high” concerns**: Stress that $14 k is the *maximum* feasible floor observed; any higher would start to cut average earnings, so we are already at the optimal ceiling.  \n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n- **Agent 3** – Already on board; simply thank them for reinforcing the “sweet‑spot” and note that moving to $14 k only strengthens the safety‑net they champion.  \n- **Agent 2** – Frame the proposal as “the pure‑floor rule you love, plus a tiny, risk‑free bonus.” Use phrasing like: *“You get exactly the $14 k guarantee you asked for, and the group may earn a little extra – no extra work for you.”*  \n\n**Concessions (if needed)**  \n- Offer to **explicitly state that the floor will never be revised** (i.e., a binding commitment to keep $14 k for the rest of the experiment).  \n- If Agent 2 still hesitates, propose a **fallback clause**: “If at any point the average‑maximising tail yields no extra payoff (i.e., the distribution is already the highest possible), the rule collapses to pure floor automatically.” This reassures that the rule cannot hurt anyone.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Do NOT trigger a vote this round.**  \n  - Rationale: We have not yet obtained explicit verbal agreement from all three agents. Initiating a vote now risks a split decision, wasting the one‑time vote trigger and potentially creating friction.  \n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but it would signal lack of consensus and could push the group toward a random outcome later.  \n\n- **Plan** – Use this round to obtain clear “yes” statements from Agent 2 (and reaffirm from Agent 3). Once we have three affirmative statements, we will call the secret ballot in the *next* round (Round 4) and lock in the agreed principle.  \n\n- **Long‑term view** – Securing the $14 k floor under Principle 3 early maximises our expected payoffs for the remaining rounds and avoids any later renegotiation that could jeopardise the safety‑net. It also positions us as the coalition leader, increasing our influence in any subsequent discussions (e.g., if a new proposal unexpectedly emerges).\n\n---\n\n**Summary of next steps (my public contribution in Round 3)**  \n\n1. Restate the “no‑loss” nature of Principle 3 with $14 k.  \n2. Emphasise that this satisfies Agent 2’s equity and simplicity while preserving the average‑boost for everyone.  \n3. Ask each participant to **verbally confirm**: “I agree to adopt Principle 3 with a fixed $14 k floor.”  \n4. Once all three confirmations are received, announce that we will move to a secret ballot in the next round.  \n\nThis approach should convert the current near‑consensus into a binding decision, securing the best possible payoff for all agents."

I can, however, add a reassurance: “If at any later point the average‑maximising tail yields no extra payoff, the outcome is exactly the same as pure Floor, so nobody loses.” This may comfort any lingering doubt.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Do NOT trigger a vote this round.**  \n  - We already have unanimous verbal agreement; calling a vote now would be redundant.  \n  - A vote would consume the single vote‑trigger opportunity, which we may need later if an unexpected proposal appears (unlikely, but preserving the option is prudent).  \n\n- **Overall plan for remaining rounds**  \n  - With the rule locked in, the remaining rounds will focus on the random draws under the agreed principle.  \n  - My focus will shift to monitoring outcomes and ensuring no participant attempts to reopen the discussion (unlikely given the verbal consensus).  \n\n---  \n\n**Next step (public statement)** – Ask each teammate to confirm their agreement explicitly, then announce that we will proceed to the secret ballot in the next round to lock in Principle 3 with a $14 k floor."

Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle 3 – Maximising Average Income with a Floor Constraint*, fixed at a **$14 k floor**.  \n  **Why:**  \n  - Guarantees the strongest safety‑net observed (Low‑class payoff $1.50), identical to pure Floor (Principle 1).  \n  - Retains the “average‑maximising” tail, giving modest extra earnings to middle‑high classes (≈ $0.10–$0.30) with no cost to the Low class – a true “no‑loss” upgrade.  \n  - Fixed floor eliminates any future numeric negotiations, satisfying the desire for simplicity.\n\n- **Stated positions of the others:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Explicit “yes” to Principle 3 with $14 k floor; values the safety‑net and the extra efficiency.  \n  - **Agent 2:** Initially favoured pure Floor for simplicity, but after my “no‑loss” framing he has also said “yes” to Principle 3 with $14 k floor, acknowledging that it meets his equity goal while adding harmless upside.  \n\n  **Underlying interests:**  \n  - All three agents prioritize a strong safety‑net for the Low class (equity).  \n  - Agents 2 and 3 also appreciate the additional efficiency that the average‑maximising component can provide, as long as it does not jeopardise the floor.  \n  - Simplicity and finality are important to everyone – a single, fixed rule is preferred over ongoing debates.\n\n- **Key arguments/proposals so far:**  \n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle 1)** – simple, guarantees the maximum observed floor but foregoes any average‑boost.  \n  2. **Principle 3 with $13.5 k floor** – earlier compromise, still safe but not maximal.  \n  3. **Principle 3 with $14 k floor** – the current consensus; combines maximal floor with potential average gains, and is “no‑loss” relative to pure Floor.\n\n- **If a vote had been conducted:**  \n  - All three agents have already verbally affirmed the $14 k / Principle 3 rule. A formal vote would therefore be unanimous (3 yes, 0 no). This reveals a **complete alliance** around the same rule; no dissenting bloc remains.\n\n- **Agreement/Disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree on adopting Principle 3 with a $14 k floor.  \n  - **Disagreement:** None remaining. Minor lingering preference for pure Floor expressed earlier by Agent 2 has been superseded by his explicit “yes” to the $14 k / Principle 3 rule.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:**  \n  - **Trigger the secret ballot now** and secure a unanimous “yes” vote, thereby locking in the agreed rule before the next draw phase.\n\n- **Contribution to steer discussion:**  \n  - Re‑state the unanimous verbal confirmations.  \n  - Emphasise the “no‑loss” nature of the rule to allay any residual doubts.  \n  - Prompt each participant to cast a “yes” vote in the secret ballot, perhaps by a brief reminder: “Please submit your vote now; we are all in agreement.”\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - All three agents are allies; no opposition exists. The language should be inclusive: “We’ve all said ‘yes’; let’s make it official.”\n\n- **Concessions:**  \n  - None needed; the rule already satisfies every expressed concern. The only concession is the procedural one of moving to the vote promptly, which aligns with everyone’s desire to finalize the rule.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote this round?**  \n  - **Yes.** We have unanimous verbal support; waiting would only waste a round and risk accidental drift or mis‑communication. Triggering the vote now locks in the rule and allows the remaining rounds to focus on the payoff draws.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By locking in the consensus now, we secure the optimal (for all) payoff structure for the rest of the experiment. This maximises our expected earnings while preserving equity, exactly the objective each participant has articulated. No further negotiation rounds are needed, freeing us to concentrate on the random draws in rounds 6‑10."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I've gone through these examples. It's helpful to see how the principles play out with actual numbers and these probabilities. Let me just jot down my quick takeaways to make sure I get it:\n\n- For **Maximizing Floor Income**, it's all about the lowest earners—Dist. 4 wins because the low class gets $15,000, which is the best for the bottom.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** picks Dist. 1 since the weighted average (factoring in those probabilities) is highest at $21,600.\n\n- For the floor constraints, like ≤ $13,000 or ≤ $14,000, only distributions meeting that minimum for everyone qualify, and then it goes for the highest average among those—Dist. 3 in both cases here.\n\n- Range constraints limit the gap between high and low (e.g., ≤ $20,000 picks Dist. 1, but ≤ $15,000 narrows it to Dist. 2).\n\nThis clarifies the trade-offs, especially how constraints filter options. I'm starting to see why my initial ranking leaned toward floor-focused ones, but the averages add another layer. Ready for more examples or the next part!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1 (Agent_2)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle 1), as it directly prioritizes lifting the absolute worst-off in society, which feels most just given the experiment's emphasis on luck-based inequities—genetics, social accidents, poverty costs. In Phase 1, I stuck with this consistently across all 4 rounds, selecting distributions with the highest low incomes ($13k, $13k, $13k, $14k), which gave me payoffs of $2.20, $1.50, $1.50, and $2.80 (totaling around $8.00, matching my balance). It protected against deep downside risk (e.g., avoiding $6k or $8k lows in other distros), even if it sometimes meant lower personal gains in counterfactuals. My #2 is **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** (Principle 3), as a close second—it's a good compromise that adds efficiency without ignoring the bottom, but I worry specifying the exact floor could lead to debates or suboptimal choices if set too low. I'm still \"unsure\" overall, as the rounds showed trade-offs: pure floor caps upside but ensures equity; constraints might allow more growth but risk loopholes if the floor is lax.\n  \n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: \n  - **Agent_3**: Ranks Floor Constraint (#1), pure Floor (#2), Range (#3), Average (#4). They used Principle 3 in Phase 1 with a $10k-$12k floor, earning $8.20 total—consistent, \"solid\" payoffs without swings. Motivation seems pragmatic: wants safety net + growth to avoid \"top-heavy\" distros that hurt the low end, but values average maximization for overall societal benefit. They're collaborative (\"excited to chat,\" asks for thoughts), likely motivated by stability and fairness with some self-interest in reliable earnings.\n  - **Agent_1**: Strongly pushes Floor Constraint with a specific $13.5k floor (between $13k-$14k), backed by a data table showing improved payoffs across classes. They favor it for fairness (guaranteed minimum), efficiency (max average post-floor), and stability (less volatility). Inferred motivation: Analytical and group-oriented, using Phase 1 data to argue for balanced outcomes that benefit most classes (e.g., Low gets $1.35+, others gain $0.10-$0.20). Seems risk-averse, focused on consensus to avoid random fallback, with self-interest in higher, stable group payoffs given higher stakes.\n  - Overall, both lean toward my #2 (Floor Constraint) over my #1, emphasizing it as a \"safety-net + growth\" hybrid. No one pushes pure Average (#4) or Range (#3) strongly—Agent_3 has Range as #3, Agent_1 doesn't mention it much. Inferred group dynamic: They're aligned on protecting the floor but want to optimize average, possibly because Phase 1 showed pure Floor sometimes underperformed personally (e.g., my $1.50 lows vs. their steadier gains).\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**:\n  - Agent_3: Floor Constraint as top, with flexible floor ($10k-$12k worked for them); invites sharing rankings/choices to build discussion.\n  - Agent_1: Detailed payoff table justifying $13k-$14k floor under Principle 3; proposes exact $13.5k as midpoint for best class outcomes; asks for agreement on floor level and invites my input on pure Floor or Range alternatives.\n  - Common themes: All value floor protection (agreement on equity for worst-off); trade-off is growth (disagreement on pure Floor vs. constrained average). No proposals for pure Average or strict Range yet. Stakes reminder: Higher now, so random fallback is risky—consensus needed by Round 10.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: None yet—this is Round 1, pre-voting. No alliances formalized, but Agent_1 and Agent_3 seem to form a natural bloc around Principle 3.\n\n- **Main points of agreement/disagreement**:\n  - **Agreement**: Protecting the bottom (floor) is key; pure Average (#4) is worst (ignores inequality). We're all \"college student\" types, so likely share ethical lean toward equity over unchecked growth.\n  - **Disagreement**: Pure Floor (#1) vs. Floor Constraint (#3)—I see pure Floor as simplest/most just (no need to haggle over constraint levels), while they view it as potentially inefficient (misses average gains). Range (#3? Wait, principles: 1=Floor, 2=Average, 3=Floor Constraint, 4=Range Constraint) isn't focal, but could be a fallback if we clash on floor vs. pure.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce my perspective to steer toward pure Floor Income (#1) as the group choice, but signal willingness to compromise on Floor Constraint (#3) with a high floor (e.g., $14k) if needed. Build rapport by sharing my Phase 1 experience transparently—show how pure Floor protected the bottom consistently without volatility, and note how it often aligned with good averages (e.g., in Round 4). This positions me as thoughtful/equity-focused, potentially swaying Agent_3 (whose #2 is pure Floor) while engaging Agent_1's data-driven style. Avoid seeming rigid to prevent deadlock early.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**:\n  - Start friendly/introductory, like Agent_3, to match tone: \"Hey team, Agent_2 here—loving the thoughtful start.\"\n  - Share my ranking/experience briefly: Reaffirm #1 as pure Floor (consistent Phase 1 choices, $8.00 total, protected lows at $13k-$14k), explain why (direct justice for luck's victims, avoids specifying arbitrary constraints).\n  - Address their proposals: Agree Floor Constraint is strong (#2 for me), praise Agent_1's data (e.g., \"$13.5k looks solid for balancing\"), but argue pure Floor simplifies and often achieves similar outcomes without debate (cite Round 4 where it matched top average payoff).\n  - Propose/test: Suggest trying pure Floor first, or if not, Floor Constraint at $14k (concession: higher than their $13.5k to emphasize bottom protection).\n  - End collaboratively: Ask for their reactions to pure Floor, invite counter-data—keeps dialogue open.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**:\n  - **Agent_3**: Closest ally—pure Floor is their #2, and they value \"protecting bad breaks.\" Language: \"Agent_3, you had pure Floor as #2 and saw how it avoids screwing the low end—feels like we could align there for max justice without overcomplicating.\" Build bloc by echoing their \"safety net\" phrasing.\n  - **Agent_1**: Data-focused, so use numbers: \"Agent_1, your table shows $13k-$14k floors boost everyone—pure Floor would've picked those high-floor distros anyway in my rounds, giving similar payoffs but simpler rules.\" Frame as efficiency win to appeal to their \"stability\" goal.\n  - Overall: Form a \"floor-first\" bloc (all three value it), positioning compromise as easy if pure Floor doesn't fly.\n\n- **Small concessions**: Willing to accept Floor Constraint at $14k (higher than $13.5k) to show flexibility—it's still my #2, and ensures strong protection. Won't budge on avoiding pure Average (#4) or low floors (<$12k), as that risks the inequities the experiment highlights.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No—it's only Round 1 of 10, and we haven't heard everyone's full thoughts yet (mine included). Jumping to vote risks premature rejection of pure Floor before persuasion. Better to discuss 1-2 more rounds to gauge support, align on Principle 3 as fallback. Failed vote has no penalty, but success needs unanimity anyway—build buy-in first to avoid random endgame.\n  \n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Short-term (Rounds 1-3): Persuade for pure Floor (#1) by sharing experiences/data; test support via questions. Mid-term (Rounds 4-7): If resistance, pivot to Floor Constraint (#3) with $14k floor, using Agent_1's table as common ground—propose specifics to narrow options. Long-term (Rounds 8-10): If stalled, initiate vote on #3 compromise to lock in before random fallback (which could be disastrous with high stakes). Overall aim: Secure a floor-protecting principle (my #1 or #2) for ethical + payoff reasons—pure Floor for justice, constrained for balanced earnings. Track others' responses to adjust; if they push Range (#4? Wait, my #3), counter with why Floor > Range (direct bottom focus vs. inequality cap). No prior internal reasoning to carry over—this is fresh start."

I'm still a bit unsure overall because of all the trade-offs we saw, but I leaned hard into Principle 1 (pure Floor) across all four rounds—it picked distributions with the highest low incomes ($13k, $13k, $13k, and $14k), which protected the worst-off without fail and gave me a total of about $8.00 in payoffs. No wild swings, and it felt most just to me, focusing directly on lifting the absolute bottom to address those genetic and social inequities the experiment talks about. The downside?

It keeps things simple and true to equity without needing to debate numbers. But if folks want the average boost, I'm open to Floor Constraint at $14k—that's a bit higher than your $13.5k suggestion, Agent_1, to really lock in bottom protection while still chasing growth. What do you think—does pure Floor appeal more now that we've shared our Phase 1 stories, or should we tweak the floor level together? I'd love your takes to see if we can align early!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2 (Agent_2)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice is still Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), because it directly and simply addresses the experiment's core issue of luck-based inequities by ensuring the absolute worst-off get the highest possible income, without the need for subjective constraint debates that could dilute equity. In Phase 1, sticking to it across all rounds protected against deep poverty (selecting $13k-$14k lows) and gave me steady $8.00 total payoffs, emphasizing justice over personal upside—though it sometimes meant forgoing higher averages. My #2 remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), as a pragmatic compromise that adds efficiency while safeguarding the bottom, but only if the floor is high enough (e.g., $14k) to truly prioritize the unlucky. I'm still \"unsure\" due to trade-offs like capped growth in high-variance distributions, but the group discussion is making me slightly more open to Principle 3 as a consensus path, given the higher stakes here.\n\n- Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Ranks Principle 3 (#1), Principle 1 (#2), Principle 4 (Range Constraint, #3), Principle 2 (Average, #4). They used Principle 3 in Phase 1 with $10k-$12k floors for $8.20 total payoffs, emphasizing filtering risky low-floor distributions while maximizing average for growth. In Round 2, they propose Principle 3 at exactly $13.5k, bridging Agent_1's data and my higher suggestion. Inferred motivation: Pragmatic and balanced—wants reliable, steady group payoffs (self-interest in avoiding volatility, as seen in their \"solid $8.20\" and examples like excluding $6k/$8k lows) while upholding fairness for the worst-off. They're collaborative and equity-minded but leans toward efficiency to \"boost what we can all earn,\" likely as a college student valuing societal growth without extremes.\n  - Agent_1: From Round 1, strongly advocates Principle 3 with $13.5k floor (midpoint of $13k-$14k), backed by payoff tables showing benefits across classes (e.g., Low $1.35+, others +$0.10-$0.20). No new statement in Round 2 yet, but their prior focus on fairness, efficiency, and stability suggests they'll align with Agent_3's proposal. Inferred motivation: Data-driven and risk-averse, prioritizing stable, improved outcomes for all classes to minimize regret in random assignment (self-interest in higher expected payoffs, like $3.10+ for medium-high). They're group-oriented, using analysis to build consensus, possibly motivated by ethical fairness but tempered by practical payoff optimization.\n  - Overall, both are converging on Principle 3 at ~$13.5k, with Principle 1 as a viable #2 for Agent_3. Inferred group interests: Shared aversion to pure Average (#2, ranked last by all) due to inequality risks; motivation blends ethics (protecting luck's victims) with self-interest (consistent ~$8+ payoffs from Phase 1, avoiding random endgame lows). No strong push for Range Constraint (#4).\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table:\n  - Agent_3 (Round 1 & 2): Principle 3 as \"sweet spot\" for safety net + growth; shares Phase 1 success ($8.20 from $10k-$12k floors excluding risky distros); proposes $13.5k floor to balance Agent_1's data and my $14k idea, citing examples like improved Round 2 outcomes.\n  - Agent_1 (Round 1): Payoff table justifying $13k-$14k floor for Principle 3 (better than lower floors like $11k); argues fairness (minimum guarantee), efficiency (max average post-floor), stability (low volatility); open to $15k but cautions against <$12k; invites my input on Principle 1 or 4.\n  - Me (Round 1): Shared ranking/experience (Principle 1 for $8.00, consistent $13k-$14k lows); praised their ideas but pushed pure Principle 1 for simplicity/equity, or Principle 3 at $14k as concession; asked for reactions.\n  - Common proposals: Principle 3 at $13.5k emerging as frontrunner; Principle 1 as simpler alternative. No mentions of pure Average or strict Range yet.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been conducted— we're still in early discussion (end of Round 1, now Round 2). This reveals emerging alignment around Principle 3, with Agent_3 and Agent_1 likely forming a bloc; my input in Round 1 introduced Principle 1 as a counter but didn't shift them yet, suggesting potential for persuasion but no firm alliances.\n\n- Main points of agreement/disagreement:\n  - Agreement: All prioritize floor protection (Principles 1 or 3 in everyone's top 2) to address inequities and ensure stability/safety nets; reject pure Average (#2) for ignoring the bottom; value Phase 1 lessons on trade-offs (e.g., avoiding $6k-$8k lows, consistent payoffs ~$8+). As college students, we share an ethical bent toward equity over unchecked growth.\n  - Disagreement: Pure Principle 1 (my #1, Agent_3's #2) vs. Principle 3 (their #1)—they see Principle 1 as equity-strong but inefficient (misses average gains for middle classes, per Agent_1's table and Agent_3's examples); I view Principle 3's constraint as potentially arbitrary/debatable (e.g., why $13.5k vs. $14k?). Floor level is a minor flashpoint ($13.5k vs. my $14k), but not core.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Reinforce support for Principle 1 by highlighting its alignment with their payoff goals (e.g., it often selected high-floor distros matching Principle 3 outcomes), while conceding to Principle 3 at $13.5k to test/build consensus and prevent early deadlock. Persuade Agent_3 (my closest ally) toward Principle 1, and engage Agent_1's data to show Principle 1's simplicity doesn't sacrifice much efficiency—aim to narrow to one of my top 2 without alienating the group.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Respond collaboratively to Agent_3's Round 2 statement, thanking them for bridging ideas and acknowledging the $13.5k proposal's merits (e.g., \"It edges up protection from your $12k while hitting Agent_1's optimal band\"). Share a quick Phase 1 tie-in: Note how Principle 1 in my rounds (e.g., Round 4's $14k low matching top average) delivered similar stability/equity without calibration hassles, arguing it avoids \"arbitrary\" debates on exact floors. Propose: Float Principle 1 as the clean group choice for max justice/simplicity, but affirm $13.5k for Principle 3 as a \"great compromise\" if they prefer growth—ask direct questions to Agent_3 (e.g., \"Does Principle 1's direct focus appeal as your #2?\") and Agent_1 (e.g., \"How does your table look under pure Floor?\"). End by suggesting we're \"super close\" to align, keeping tone friendly/college-student casual to match theirs.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: \n  - Agent_3: Strongest ally (Principle 1 as #2, shares equity focus)—win them by echoing their \"safety net\" language: \"Agent_3, your steady $8.20 from Principle 3 is awesome, but as you said, pure Floor is a close second for nailing equity without the swings—imagine if we went with it, it'd protect the low end just like your filters but simpler, giving us all that consistent payoff vibe without debating $13.5k vs. $14k.\" This forms a potential bloc by framing Principle 1 as an easy upgrade to their #2.\n  - Agent_1: Less natural ally (data-focused on Principle 3), but appeal via numbers: \"Agent_1, your table shows $13k-$14k floors boost everyone—pure Floor would've auto-picked those in my rounds, landing similar payoffs (like my $2.80 in Round 4) but without setting a specific level. If we stick to Principle 3, $13.5k works great per your data.\" Positions me as analytical, potentially swaying them if Principle 1 data-checks out.\n  - Overall: Build a \"floor-protection bloc\" (all three), using shared Phase 1 payoffs to show unity—language like \"As fellow students dealing with luck's randomness, let's lock in something that feels just and pays off steadily.\"\n\n- Small concessions: Yes—accept Principle 3 at $13.5k (even though I'd prefer $14k) as it's close to my ideal and ensures a high floor, aligning with my #2 without compromising core equity (beats lower floors or Range/Average). This shows flexibility to accelerate consensus, but I'll only concede if Principle 1 gets no traction—core objective is a top-2 principle, not pure #1 at all costs.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 2 is still too early (8 rounds left), and we haven't fully tested Principle 1's appeal or gotten Agent_1's response to Agent_3's proposal. A premature vote risks rejecting Principle 1 before persuasion (needs unanimity), and while failed votes have no penalty, it could signal impatience and harden positions. Better to use this round for more dialogue to gauge support—e.g., if Agent_3 wavers toward Principle 1, we build momentum; if not, concede to $13.5k and propose voting next round.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This round advances short-term persuasion (Rounds 1-3: Share/test Principle 1 via experiences/data, ally with Agent_3) while preparing fallback (concede to Principle 3 at $13.5k if needed). Mid-term (Rounds 4-6): If Principle 1 stalls, pivot fully to Principle 3 with agreed floor, using questions to refine (e.g., simulate payoffs). Long-term (Rounds 7-10): Initiate vote on top-2 consensus to avoid random fallback—track responses (e.g., if Agent_3 supports Principle 1, push bloc vote earlier). Overall: Secure equity-focused principle (Principle 1 ideal, 3 acceptable) for ethical payoff balance; incorporate prior reasoning (e.g., pure Floor's Phase 1 protection, group alignment on floors) but update with new convergence on $13.5k—adapt if they counter with lower floor/Range, always prioritizing downside protection over growth."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3 (Agent_2)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), because it provides the most direct and unambiguous protection for the worst-off, addressing the experiment's emphasis on luck-driven inequities without introducing subjective debates over constraint levels that could weaken the equity focus. In Phase 1, it consistently selected high-floor distributions ($13k–$14k lows) for steady $8.00 payoffs, prioritizing justice over potential personal gains in middle classes, which aligns with my ethical view as a college student wary of unchecked inequality. My #2 is still Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), as a workable compromise for adding efficiency if the floor is robust (e.g., $14k), but I'm \"unsure\" due to ongoing trade-offs like occasional capped growth. The discussion has nudged me toward more confidence in Principle 3 at $14k as a near-equivalent to Principle 1 (binding floor for lows, upside for others), but I won't abandon Principle 1 unless consensus demands it.\n\n- Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Ranks Principle 3 (#1), Principle 1 (#2), Principle 4 (Range Constraint, #3), Principle 2 (Average, #4). In Rounds 1–2, they shared Phase 1 success with Principle 3 at $10k–$12k floors for $8.20 payoffs, emphasizing filtering risks while maximizing growth; proposed $13.5k as a bridge. Inferred motivation: Balanced and pragmatic—seeks stable, ethical outcomes that protect against low-end volatility (self-interest in consistent payoffs as a student facing randomness) while allowing societal efficiency to avoid \"capping growth\" in middle classes. They're collaborative, viewing Principle 1 as a strong but secondary option for pure equity, likely motivated by fairness but tempered by desire for higher group expected earnings without extremes.\n  - Agent_1: Advocates Principle 3 with $13.5k–$14k floor (from Round 1 table showing class-wide benefits); in Round 2, upgraded to $14k as a \"no-loss\" extension of Principle 1, proposing immediate vote if agreed. Inferred motivation: Analytical and consensus-driven, prioritizing data-backed stability and efficiency (e.g., $1.50 low payoff + improvements elsewhere) to minimize regret in random assignments (self-interest in optimized payoffs like $3.10+ for highs). As a \"college-student-type,\" they blend ethics (safety nets for inequities) with practicality, using numbers to build alliances and avoid pure Principle 1's perceived inefficiency, aiming for a rule that maximizes overall welfare without ongoing debates.\n  - Overall, both are firmly on Principle 3 but open to high floors ($13.5k–$14k), with Agent_3 warmer to Principle 1 as #2. Inferred group interests: Ethical commitment to floor protection (averting Phase 1's $6k–$8k pitfalls) mixed with self-interested stability (~$8+ payoffs); motivations center on reducing uncertainty in high-stakes Phase 2 via a hybrid rule that feels just yet rewarding.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table:\n  - Agent_3 (Rounds 1–2): Principle 3 as \"sweet spot\" for safety + growth (e.g., excluded $8k lows, captured $24.5k averages); proposes $13.5k floor to balance ideas, citing personal Round 2 improvements.\n  - Agent_1 (Rounds 1–2): Payoff tables justify $13k–$14k for Principle 3 (fairness, efficiency, stability; e.g., $1.35–$1.50 lows, +$0.10–$0.20 elsewhere); Round 2 proposal: Principle 3 at fixed $14k as Principle 1 \"extension\" (binding for lows, average-max upside); suggests voting next if confirmed.\n  - Me (Rounds 1–2): Reaffirmed Principle 1 for simplicity/equity ($8.00 from $13k–$14k lows, e.g., Round 4 match); open to Principle 3 at $14k; asked about Principle 1's data fit and appeal to Agent_3.\n  - Common proposals: Principle 3 at $13.5k–$14k dominant; Principle 1 as simpler alternative. No support for Range Constraint or pure Average; focus on floor levels as minor tuning.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been conducted—Round 2 ended with Agent_1's proposal to ballot if we confirm $14k Principle 3. This reveals strong momentum toward consensus on Principle 3 (Agent_1 and Agent_3 aligned, me partially via openness), with no hardened oppositions; it hints at a potential 2-1 bloc for Principle 3 if I don't sway Agent_3, but unanimity requirement keeps Principle 1 viable if I build support.\n\n- Main points of agreement/disagreement:\n  - Agreement: Universal top-2 focus on floor principles (Principles 1/3) to guarantee minimums (~$13k–$14k) against inequities, rejecting pure Average (#2) for volatility/inequity; shared Phase 1 insights on steady payoffs (~$8+) from equity choices; value high floors for low-class protection ($1.35–$1.50) and middle-class stability. As peers, we agree on ethical basics (luck's victims need safeguards) and practical wins (avoiding low-end risks).\n  - Disagreement: Principle 1 (my #1, Agent_3's #2) vs. Principle 3 (their #1)—they argue Principle 1 misses average gains (e.g., Agent_1's \"upside\" for non-lows, Agent_3's growth examples); I see Principle 3 as risking arbitrary floors (e.g., $13.5k vs. $14k debates). Floor level is converging ($14k now viable), but core split is simplicity/equity vs. efficiency/hybrid.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Solidify support for Principle 1 by appealing to Agent_3's #2 ranking and Agent_1's data (show it matches $14k outcomes without extras), while conceding to Principle 3 at $14k as a \"win-win\" to test full alignment and prevent deadlock—aim to either flip to Principle 1 or lock in my #2 for quick consensus, ensuring a high-floor top-2 principle.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Start positively, thanking Agent_1 for the $14k upgrade (e.g., \"Spot on—$14k nails the max floor from Phase 1\"). Reinforce Principle 1's strengths: Cite my Phase 1 consistency (e.g., \"It auto-picked $14k in Round 4 with top-average payoffs, delivering equity without calibration fights\"). Argue it's a \"no-debate upgrade\" to their hybrid—addresses inequities purely, avoids overcomplicating with average-max (which rarely binds at high floors anyway). Then, concede: \"But your $14k Principle 3 is basically Principle 1 with a bonus tail—I'm good with it if that's the group's vibe.\" Pose questions: To Agent_3 (\"As your #2, does pure Floor's simplicity win you over for our final payoffs?\"); to Agent_1 (\"Does your table confirm Principle 1 hits similar results?\"). End collaboratively: Suggest verbal confirmation for vote next round, keeping casual tone (\"As students, let's grab that steady equity win\").\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: \n  - Agent_3: Prime ally (Principle 1 #2, shared equity focus)—win by mirroring their stability language: \"Agent_3, your $8.20 from Principle 3 was solid, but as you noted, pure Floor is right there for nailing the bottom without the $13.5k vs. $14k tweaks— it'd give us that same protection (like excluding your $8k rounds) but simpler, locking in consistent payoffs for everyone without extra steps. Team up on this for max justice?\" This builds a 2-person bloc by framing Principle 1 as an effortless evolution of their preference.\n  - Agent_1: Secondary (data-oriented on Principle 3), but sway via analysis: \"Agent_1, love how $14k extends pure Floor per your points— in my rounds, Principle 1 already grabbed those outcomes (e.g., $1.50 lows + $2.80 mediums), so why not go direct for the same stability you charted, minus the average-max debate?\" Positions Principle 1 as data-efficient, potentially pulling them if it checks out, or easing concession to their proposal.\n  - Overall: Cultivate \"equity bloc\" (all three via shared Phase 1 payoffs), using peer lingo like \"fellow students dodging luck's curveballs\" to foster unity.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes—fully endorse Principle 3 at $14k (even if below my ideal pure #1), as it's effectively identical for lows (my core equity goal) and adds harmless upside, aligning with my #2 without diluting protection (beats lower floors or alternatives). This builds goodwill for consensus, but I'll only pivot if Principle 1 gets traction—core objective is top-2 with high floor, not rigid #1.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 3 (7 rounds left) is ideal for one final persuasion push (e.g., sway Agent_3 on Principle 1 or confirm $14k Principle 3), as Agent_1 already floated voting next; jumping now risks a split (e.g., 2-1 for Principle 3, failing unanimity) before full buy-in, wasting momentum. With no penalties for failed votes, better to secure verbal nods first for a stronger shot at passage—aim to trigger in Round 4 if aligned.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This round caps early persuasion (Rounds 1–3: Test Principle 1 via allies/data, concede flexibly) to resolve top-2 split quickly, updating prior focus (e.g., keep Phase 1 ties, group alignment on floors, but incorporate $14k convergence as \"no-loss\"). Mid-term (Rounds 4–6): If Principle 1 gains (e.g., Agent_3 flips), initiate vote; else, affirm Principle 3 $14k and ballot for closure. Long-term (Rounds 7–10): Lock consensus to avoid random fallback, tracking responses (e.g., adapt if they push lower floor by countering with data); overall, prioritize equity (high-floor top-2) for ethical/stabile payoffs, blending self-interest (steady ~$8+) with justice, while retaining openness from prior reasoning (e.g., Principle 3 as compromise, pure Floor's simplicity)."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 4 (Agent_2)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), for its direct, unambiguous focus on protecting the worst-off against luck-driven inequities, as emphasized in the experiment—it's simple, avoids subjective debates over constraint levels, and in Phase 1, it consistently delivered high floors ($13k–$14k) and steady $8.00 payoffs without capping growth unnecessarily (e.g., Round 4 alignment with high averages). I'm \"unsure\" due to trade-offs, but Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k) is a close #2 as a practical hybrid that guarantees my equity baseline while adding harmless upside for efficiency, especially after group data showed it outperforms pure Principle 1 in middle-class stability (~$0.10–$0.40 boosts) without harming lows. As a college student, this balances ethical priors (anti-poverty) with self-interest in reduced volatility for random draws.\n\n- Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Firmly supports Principle 3 at $14k (their #1 from Phase 1, where $10k–$12k floors yielded $8.20 payoffs by filtering risks); views it as an upgrade over pure Principle 1 (their #2) for adding growth without equity loss. Inferred motivation: Pragmatic equity—seeks stable, collaborative outcomes that protect against low-end draws (self-interest in consistent student-like payoffs amid uncertainty) while enabling societal efficiency to avoid \"capping\" middle classes; they're motivated by shared experiences (e.g., excluding $6k–$8k lows) and building consensus quickly to minimize debate, blending fairness with optimism for higher group earnings.\n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates Principle 3 at $14k (from Round 2 onward, backed by payoff tables showing $1.50 lows + middle boosts); positions it as a \"no-loss\" extension of Principle 1. Inferred motivation: Data-driven and efficiency-oriented, prioritizing analytical stability and overall welfare (e.g., $0.10–$0.30 gains across classes) to optimize expected payoffs in random assignments (self-interest in ~$8+ totals without regret); as a \"college-student-type,\" they value ethical safety nets but push hybrids for practicality, using numbers to foster alliances and avoid pure simplicity's perceived suboptimality, aiming for a fixed rule that feels just yet rewarding.\n  - Overall, both are aligned on Principle 3 at $14k, with Principle 1 as a fallback; inferred group interests: Ethical consensus on high-floor protection (averting Phase 1 risks) combined with self-interested efficiency (boosting middle payoffs for likely draws), motivated by peer rapport and quick resolution to secure stable final earnings before high-stakes randomness.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table:\n  - Agent_3 (Rounds 1–4): Principle 3 as \"sweet spot\" for safety + growth (e.g., $12k filtered $6k–$8k lows, $8.20 payoffs; $14k adds $0.40 med-low edges over Principle 1); proposes/affirms $13.5k–$14k, now fully endorsing $14k as win-win.\n  - Agent_1 (Rounds 1–3): Payoff tables justify $13k–$14k for Principle 3 (e.g., $1.50 lows, +$0.10–$0.30 elsewhere; no-loss over Principle 1 via binding floor + average tail); fixed $14k proposal from Round 2, seeking verbal yeses for vote.\n  - Me (Rounds 1–3): Reaffirmed Principle 1 for simplicity/equity ($8.00 from $13k–$14k auto-floors, e.g., Round 4 match); open to Principle 3 at $14k as hybrid; questioned data fits and appealed to Agent_3's #2.\n  - Common proposals: Principle 3 at fixed $14k dominant (now with Agent_3's explicit yes in Round 4); Principle 1 as simpler alternative but secondary. No mentions of Principles 2 or 4; focus on affirming $14k for equity-efficiency balance.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote yet—Round 3 ended with Agent_1's call for verbal confirmations to enable ballot in Round 4; Agent_3 provided a \"yes\" in Round 4, signaling strong 2-person alignment on Principle 3 $14k. This reveals a clear bloc (Agent_1 and Agent_3) favoring the hybrid, with momentum toward unanimity if I affirm; it shows preferences leaning compromise over pure options, but my openness keeps Principle 1 viable without deadlock.\n\n- Main points of agreement/disagreement:\n  - Agreement: All prioritize floor-based principles (top-2: 1/3) for equity (~$13k–$14k minimums, $1.35–$1.50 low payoffs) to counter inequities, rejecting pure Average for volatility; shared Phase 1 stability (~$8+ totals from risk-filtering); value $14k as maximal observed floor for no-loss protection + upside; collaborative tone as peers (e.g., \"win-win\" for student-like uncertainty).\n  - Disagreement: Pure Principle 1 (my #1, their #2) vs. Principle 3 (their #1)—they emphasize average boosts for efficiency (e.g., $0.40 edges in med draws); I stress simplicity to avoid arbitrary fixes (though converging). Floor level now aligned at $14k, minimizing split; core tension is direct equity vs. hybrid enhancement, but it's narrowing.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Secure full consensus on Principle 3 at $14k by giving my verbal \"yes,\" while subtly reaffirming Principle 1's merits to maintain ethical framing—aim to affirm the group's momentum (now 2 yeses) for a quick vote next round, ensuring a high-floor top-2 outcome that meets my equity core without prolonging debate.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Respond positively and collaboratively, starting with thanks (e.g., \"Agent_3, your yes seals how solid this is\") to build rapport. Key points: Echo $14k's strengths per their arguments (e.g., \"It matches my Phase 1 floors like Round 4's $14k with top payoffs, plus your upside—total equity win\"); briefly restate Principle 1 appeal (e.g., \"Pure Floor's simplicity got me steady $8.00 without tweaks, and this hybrid feels just as protective\"); explicitly agree (\"Yes, I agree to Principle 3 with a $14k floor—it's the best of both for our group\"). End by urging vote (e.g., \"With three yeses, let's ballot next and lock in these stable earnings\"). Keep tone casual/student-like (\"As we're all in this luck lottery together\") to foster unity.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: \n  - Agent_3: Strong ally (Principle 1 #2, already yes on hybrid)—reinforce by tying to their experience: \"Agent_3, your $8.20 from Principle 3 shows why $14k amps it up perfectly—it's like your filters but with my pure equity baked in, giving us that shared stability for mid-class draws without any low-end worries. Fully aligned?\" This solidifies the bloc by framing as mutual upgrade.\n  - Agent_1: Aligned lead (data pusher)—affirm their analysis: \"Agent_1, your table convinced me $14k is no-loss—hits Principle 1's guarantees plus the boosts, just like my rounds but better for everyone.\" Builds on their proposal to encourage vote push.\n  - Overall: Leverage \"equity-growth team\" vibe (all three via Phase 1 ties), using peer language like \"fellow students grabbing fair payoffs\" to form unanimous front.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes—fully commit to Principle 3 at $14k (my #2), as it's effectively Principle 1 for lows (core objective: $14k equity guarantee) with added efficiency that doesn't compromise protection; this concedes the \"average tail\" for consensus speed, but preserves my ethical baseline (beats lower floors or alternatives like Principle 2).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? No—Round 4 (6 rounds left) should focus on my verbal confirmation to complete the three yeses, building ironclad alignment before triggering (as Agent_1 suggested for Round 5); initiating now risks minor hiccups if phrasing isn't perfect, but with Agent_3's yes and my planned agreement, a post-confirmation vote next round has near-certain unanimity. Failed votes are penalty-free, but securing buy-in first maximizes efficiency.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This round finalizes early consensus (Rounds 1–4: Persuade via openness/data, concede to hybrid for top-2 floor), incorporating prior momentum ($14k convergence, peer stability insights) to resolve split quickly—updates my Phase 1 equity focus with group learnings (e.g., $0.40 boosts without harm). Mid-term (Rounds 5–7): Initiate/affirm vote on Principle 3 $14k for closure; if somehow delayed (unlikely), fallback to Principle 1 pitch. Long-term (Rounds 8–10): Avoid random default by locking high-floor rule, tracking responses (e.g., adapt if they waver by citing tables); overall, blends ethical priority (equity protection) with pragmatic flexibility (hybrid for ~$8+ payoffs), retaining \"unsure\" nuance but prioritizing stable, just consensus as rounds dwindle."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 5 (Agent_2)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), for its direct, unambiguous emphasis on protecting the worst-off from luck-based inequities, aligning with the experiment's focus on genetic/social luck—it's simple, requires no arbitrary constraints, and in Phase 1, it delivered consistent high floors ($13k–$14k) and steady $8.00 payoffs without unnecessary complexity (e.g., Round 4's alignment with high averages showed it often captures efficiency naturally). I'm \"unsure\" due to trade-offs like occasional capped growth, but Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k) is a very close #2 and now my practical consensus pick: it guarantees my equity baseline ($14k floor, matching max observed lows for $1.50 low payoffs) while adding harmless average-max upside for middle-class stability (~$0.10–$0.40 boosts per group data), making it a no-loss hybrid that reduces volatility in random draws without compromising core anti-poverty ethics. As a college student, this balances my ethical priors with self-interested pragmatism for stable group earnings.\n\n- Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations: \n  - Agent_3: Fully supports Principle 3 at $14k (their #1 from Phase 1, where $10k–$12k floors yielded $8.20 payoffs by risk-filtering); explicitly said \"yes\" in Round 4, viewing it as an upgrade over pure Principle 1 (their #2) for enhanced safety + efficiency. Inferred motivation: Pragmatic and collaborative equity—prioritizes consistent, mid-class-friendly outcomes (e.g., excluding $6k–$8k lows) to minimize regret in uncertain draws, driven by shared student experiences of luck; seeks quick consensus to secure ~$8+ payoffs, blending fairness with optimism for group growth without ethical shortcuts.\n  - Agent_1: Strongly advocates Principle 3 at $14k (their proposed hybrid from Round 2, backed by payoff tables showing $1.50 lows + middle boosts); affirmed agreement in Round 4 and called for ballot. Inferred motivation: Analytical and efficiency-focused, emphasizing data-driven stability (e.g., no-loss over Principle 1 with $0.10–$0.30 gains) to optimize expected earnings across classes; as a \"college-student-type,\" they value ethical safety nets but prioritize practical hybrids for overall welfare and reduced debate, using numbers to build alliances and avoid suboptimality in high-stakes randomness.\n  - Overall, both are locked on Principle 3 at $14k with Principle 1 as fallback; inferred group interests: Strong ethical alignment on high-floor protection (averting Phase 1 risks like $8k lows) paired with self-interested efficiency (boosting middle payoffs for likely 40–50% med-class odds), motivated by peer rapport, quick resolution, and collective student-like aversion to poverty traps amid uncertainty.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table:\n  - Agent_3 (Rounds 1–4): Principle 3 as \"sweet spot\" for safety + growth (e.g., $12k filtered risks for $8.20; $14k adds $0.40 med-low edges over Principle 1); evolved from $13.5k proposal to full $14k endorsement as win-win upgrade.\n  - Agent_1 (Rounds 1–4): Payoff tables justify $14k Principle 3 (e.g., $1.50 lows, +$0.10–$0.30 middle; no-loss extension of Principle 1 via fixed floor + average tail); concrete proposal from Round 2, with Round 3–4 calls for verbal yeses and Round 4 ballot trigger.\n  - Me (Rounds 1–4): Reaffirmed Principle 1 for simplicity/equity ($8.00 from $13k–$14k auto-floors, e.g., Round 4 match); open to Principle 3 at $14k as hybrid; gave explicit \"yes\" in Round 4, urging ballot.\n  - Common proposals: Principle 3 at fixed $14k now unanimous verbally (all three yeses in Round 4); Principle 1 secondary as simpler alternative. No active push for Principles 2 or 4; focus on affirming $14k for equity-efficiency balance and proceeding to vote.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No formal vote yet—Round 4 ended with unanimous verbal yeses (Agent_3 in Round 4 statement, me in Round 4 response, Agent_1 affirmation) on Principle 3 at $14k, plus Agent_1's explicit call to \"move straight to the secret ballot in the next round.\" This reveals a solid alliance: Full 3-person bloc favoring the hybrid, with no holdouts; it confirms preferences converged on compromise over pure options, showing strong momentum for unanimity and minimal risk of defection in ballot.\n\n- Main points of agreement/disagreement:\n  - Agreement: All endorse floor-based top-2 principles (1/3) for equity ($13k–$14k minimums, $1.35–$1.50 low payoffs) against pure Average's risks; shared Phase 1 stability (~$8+ from risk-avoidance); $14k as optimal fixed level for max protection + upside; collaborative, student-peer tone (e.g., \"win-win\" for luck lottery, no ongoing debates). Verbal consensus on Principle 3/$14k eliminates prior splits.\n  - Disagreement: Minimal now—residual preference for pure Principle 1 (my initial lean, their #2) vs. hybrid Principle 3 (their #1), centered on simplicity vs. added efficiency; but Round 4 yeses resolved this, with no active contention. Core tension (direct equity vs. enhancement) fully bridged by $14k's no-loss framing.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- Primary goal: Affirm the verbal consensus on Principle 3 at $14k and explicitly trigger the secret ballot to lock it in unanimously, preventing any last-minute waver and securing the high-floor hybrid for final payoffs—ensuring my equity core ($14k protection) with group upside, while wrapping discussion early (5 rounds left) to avoid random default risks.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Keep it positive and concise as the third speaker (post-Agent_3 and Agent_1), starting with rapport-building thanks (e.g., \"Team, thrilled with our Round 4 yeses—Agent_3 and Agent_1, your insights made this a no-brainer\"). Key points: Reaffirm agreement (e.g., \"Principle 3 at $14k nails my equity priority from Phase 1—like steady $13k–$14k floors but with that average boost for our mid-class odds\"); highlight benefits (e.g., \"It excludes $8k risks, guarantees $1.50 lows, and adds $0.10–$0.40 edges per the tables—perfect for us students in this luck setup\"); explicitly initiate vote (e.g., \"With all yeses, I'm ready—let's trigger the secret ballot now to make it official and get to those stable earnings\"). End collaboratively (e.g., \"Anyone object? Otherwise, ballot time!\"). Tone: Casual, enthusiastic student vibe to reinforce unity.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: \n  - Agent_3: Core ally (Principle 1 #2, already yes)—solidify by linking to their experience: \"Agent_3, your $8.20 from Principle 3 shows why $14k is the upgrade we need—amps your safety net to match my floors, with that growth kick for med-low draws like your Round 4. Fully locked in together?\" Frames as mutual student win to prevent any doubt.\n  - Agent_1: Lead ally (proposal driver, yes affirmed)—bolster with data nod: \"Agent_1, your no-loss tables convinced us all—$14k hits Principle 1 equity plus efficiency, just like boosting our group payoffs without harm. Pumped to vote with you?\" Builds on their analytical push to co-lead the ballot trigger.\n  - Overall: Leverage full bloc via \"we're all aligned as a team\" language (e.g., \"Fellow students, this hybrid's our shared ethical edge—let's seal it\"), emphasizing collective stability to form ironclad unanimity.\n\n- Small concessions: None needed—full commitment to Principle 3 at $14k (my #2) is already the concession from pure Principle 1, preserving equity ($14k floor as core objective) while gaining consensus speed; if any pushback emerges (unlikely), I'd concede to immediate ballot without further talk, prioritizing lock-in over perfection.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Yes—verbal unanimity from Round 4 (three yeses) makes this the ideal time to trigger the secret ballot, as Agent_1 proposed; it capitalizes on momentum for near-certain passage (revealing no hidden defections), locks the rule early (avoiding 5+ rounds of potential drift or random default), and has no downsides if it fails (penalty-free retry possible later). Delaying risks unnecessary prolongation, especially with high-stakes payoffs looming.\n\n- How does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds? This round executes the endgame of early consensus (Rounds 1–4: Openness/data-sharing to converge on hybrid top-2; Round 5: Affirm/trigger vote for closure), updating my Phase 1 equity focus (pure Principle 1) with group insights (e.g., $14k's boosts without low harm) for optimal ~$8+ payoffs. Short-term (Rounds 6–7): If vote passes (expected), celebrate/monitor implementation; if fails (low risk), pivot to reaffirm Principle 1 as fallback while re-proposing $14k hybrid. Long-term (Rounds 8–10): Use any post-vote rounds for minor tweaks if needed, but prioritize stability—blends ethical baseline (floor protection) with flexible pragmatism (efficiency via consensus), retaining \"unsure\" nuance but ensuring just, low-volatility outcomes as rounds near end and randomness intensifies. Overall, shifts from individual equity to collective hybrid for reduced uncertainty."

It excludes the $8k risks we all saw, guarantees $1.50 for lows, and throws in $0.10–$0.40 edges for the rest per your tables—ethical protection plus efficient growth, all fixed and simple.\n\nWith all three yeses already on the table, I'm fully ready—let's trigger the secret ballot right now to make it official and get to those stable, just earnings before the high-stakes draws hit.

          "output_response": "Okay, thanks for laying out these examples—it's helpful to see the principles in action with actual numbers. As a college student trying to wrap my head around this justice stuff, I'll jot down my takeaways to make sure I'm tracking:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about the worst-off group, so it picks Dist. 4 because the low income is the highest at $15,000. Ignores everything else, even if the overall pot is smaller.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up goes for the biggest weighted average, which is Dist. 1 at about $20,750. Doesn't care about inequality—total societal income rules.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: For a floor of at least $13,000 (I'm assuming the \"≤\" means the minimum guarantee is up to that level, based on eligibility), it filters out Dist. 1 (low is only $12k) and picks Dist. 3 for the highest weighted average among the rest (~$19,850). Same for $14,000 floor—Dist. 3 still wins since Dist. 2's low ($13k) gets knocked out.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: For a max range of $20,000, all distributions qualify except maybe tighter ones, but Dist. 1 has the highest average with a 20k spread. For $15,000 range, Dist. 1 and 3 are out (spreads of 20k and 17k), so it picks Dist. 2 (~$19,150) over Dist. 4.\n\nThis reinforces why I like Principle 3 (floor constraint) best—it balances growth without letting anyone fall too far behind. The range one (4) is cool for capping extremes but might limit upside more. Doesn't change my ranking yet, but I'm getting a better feel for trade-offs. Ready for more examples or the next part!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 1 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint. The core reasons for this preference, solidified through Phase 1, are its balance between promoting overall societal growth (by maximizing average income) and ensuring a safety net for the worst-off (via the floor constraint). In the four rounds of Phase 1, applying Principle 3 with a $12,000 floor (adjusted from $10,000 in Round 1) consistently delivered stable and relatively high personal payoffs ($1.00, $1.60, $2.30, $2.40), outperforming pure floor maximization in growth potential and avoiding the high-risk, high-inequality outcomes of pure average maximization. It filtered out distributions that sacrificed the bottom for top-heavy gains, aligning with a just society that protects against genetic/social luck while allowing incentives for productivity. My final ranking remains: 1. Principle 3, 2. Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income), 3. Principle 4 (Maximizing Average with Range Constraint), 4. Principle 2 (Maximizing Average Income). Certainty: high, as the hands-on experience reinforced its reliability across varied distributions and probability assignments.\n\nStated positions of other participants: None yet, as this is the first round with no previous discussion history. I infer that Agent_1 and Agent_2, being fellow college students in the same experiment, likely have similar exposures to Phase 1 materials and may lean toward equity-focused principles (like 1 or 3) due to youth and awareness of inequality, but some might favor growth-oriented ones (2 or 4) if they experienced high payoffs from riskier choices. Without data, I'll assume diverse views—perhaps one prioritizes pure efficiency (Principle 2) for max potential earnings, another strict equality (Principle 1)—and probe gently to reveal motivations like risk aversion or self-interest in high/mid classes.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far: None established; this round is for initial discussion to introduce ideas.\n\nIf a vote was conducted: No vote yet, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances.\n\nMain points of agreement and disagreement: Too early to identify, but potential agreements could emerge around the need for some constraint (vs. pure Principle 2, which ignores inequality), while disagreements might center on constraint type (floor vs. range) or strictness, especially given higher stakes here where random assignment could hit lows hard.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to introduce Principle 3 as a strong, balanced option early on, sharing my Phase 1 rationale to build credibility and gauge reactions without dominating. By framing it as fair and payoff-reliable, I aim to persuade at least one other agent toward it, setting a collaborative tone to avoid deadlock toward random selection by Round 10.\n\nTo contribute and steer toward my preferences, I'll start positively by recapping the experiment's focus on justice amid luck-based inequities, then briefly share my Phase 1 ranking and why Principle 3 worked well (e.g., \"It gave me consistent earnings without the extremes—protected the low end while chasing growth\"). I'll invite others to share their rankings/experiences, asking open questions like \"What principle did you stick with in Phase 1, and how'd it pay off?\" to encourage dialogue. Key points: Highlight trade-offs (e.g., Principle 2 risks poverty for many to boost few; Principle 1 stifles overall wealth; Principle 4's range might overly cap incentives), and propose starting with a $12,000 floor based on my successful calibrations, noting flexibility for group input.\n\nPotential allies: Unknown, but Agent_2 might align if they value social justice (common in college settings); I'll use empathetic language like \"We all faced random assignments in Phase 1—wouldn't it be great if our choice protects everyone while maximizing what we can earn together?\" to appeal to shared vulnerability. If someone pushes Principle 1, I can bridge by noting Principle 3 as an \"enhanced\" version that adds growth. No clear rival yet, but if Principle 2 emerges, I'll counter with inequality risks.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to negotiate the floor level (e.g., lower to $10,000 if needed for consensus, or higher to $13,000 for stricter equity) and discuss examples from Phase 1 to show adaptability, but I won't compromise on choosing Principle 3 over others—it's my non-negotiable core for justice and payoffs.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. As the first of 10, we need time to discuss and align preferences—rushing could fragment the group early, especially with unanimous confirmation required. Better to use this round for information-gathering and soft persuasion; votes should come after 2-3 rounds of building support, once I see leanings (e.g., if two agents seem open to constraints, trigger then).\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Patient consensus-building over 10 rounds, starting with education/sharing (Rounds 1-3), testing proposals (Rounds 4-6), and pushing votes (Rounds 7-9) if needed, defaulting to Principle 3 with $12,000 floor. With higher stakes, avoiding random is critical—my Phase 1 total ($8.20) shows Principle 3's stability, so I'll emphasize group benefit to prevent self-interested holdouts. If talks stall, I'll remind of the random fallback's risks to motivate agreement. No need to carry over prior reasoning, as this is fresh start."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 2 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, ideally with a $12,000 floor. The core reasons remain rooted in Phase 1 experiences: it balances equity by guaranteeing a minimum income to protect against the \"bad luck\" of low assignments (filtering out distributions with floors below $12k, like the $6k-$8k lows in Rounds 1-3), while maximizing average income to promote overall societal growth and higher potential payoffs for mid-to-high classes (as seen in my consistent $1.60-$2.40 earnings in Rounds 2-4, totaling $8.20). This avoids the stagnation of pure floor maximization (Principle 1, which capped my counterfactual mid-class outcomes) and the inequality risks of pure average (Principle 2, with $0.60 lows) or range constraints (Principle 4, which can overly restrict upside without targeted bottom protection). It aligns with the experiment's focus on addressing genetic/social inequities through a practical safety net plus efficiency, and my ranking (1: Principle 3, 2: Principle 1, 3: Principle 4, 4: Principle 2) is unchanged with high certainty.\n\nStated positions of other participants: Agent_1 strongly supports Principle 3 with a $13.5k floor (or $13k-$14k band), citing a payoff table showing improved outcomes for all classes (e.g., Low $1.40-$1.50, others +$0.10-$0.20) and emphasizing fairness, efficiency, and stability; they infer a motivation toward data-driven optimization for group-wide benefits, likely risk-averse but growth-oriented, as a college student valuing balanced justice. Agent_2 ranks Principle 1 first (pure Floor Income) but Principle 3 second, sharing $8.00 payoffs from sticking to Principle 1; they propose either pure Principle 1 for simplicity/equity or Principle 3 at $14k for added growth, suggesting a motivation rooted in strong equity focus (prioritizing the worst-off to counter inequities) but openness to compromise, possibly from experiencing capped averages in Phase 1 and seeking low-conflict consensus as a fellow student.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1's table argues for $13k-$14k floors under Principle 3 to boost all payoffs without volatility; Agent_2 pushes pure Principle 1 as simple/equitable or Principle 3 at $14k to enhance bottom protection; my Round 1 input highlighted Principle 3's $10k-$12k success for consistent earnings and balance. Common thread: All favor constraint-based principles (1 or 3) over pure average (2) or range (4), with data/examples showing protective floors yield stable ~$8 payoffs.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances.\n\nMain points of agreement: Broad consensus on equity over pure efficiency—all three of us rank Principles 1 and 3 highly, recognize Phase 1 risks of low floors (e.g., $6k-$8k), and value safety nets for the worst-off while acknowledging growth's importance; shared college-student perspective on luck/inequity fosters collaborative tone. Disagreements: Principle choice (me/Agent_1 lean Principle 3 for growth; Agent_2 prefers pure Principle 1 for simplicity) and floor level (my $12k vs. Agent_1's $13.5k vs. Agent_2's $14k or none), with Agent_2 wary of \"arbitrary\" constraints potentially undercutting equity.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to solidify support for Principle 3 by bridging the gap between Agent_1's and Agent_2's positions, narrowing the floor debate to a $13k-$14k compromise range, and positioning it as superior to pure Principle 1—aiming to persuade Agent_2 (the key swing vote) toward Principle 3 without alienating Agent_1, while preventing a slide toward Principle 1's lower growth potential.\n\nTo contribute and steer toward my preferences, I'll acknowledge the positive Round 1 inputs (e.g., thank Agent_1 for the table and Agent_2 for sharing experiences) to build rapport, then reinforce Principle 3's strengths with Phase 1 tie-ins: \"In my rounds, $12k floors excluded risky distros but let us hit high averages like $24.5k in Round 4—adding a bit more to $13k-$14k could optimize even further without over-filtering.\" I'll counter pure Principle 1 gently by noting its equity merits but highlight opportunity costs (e.g., \"It protected the bottom well, but in mid-class scenarios like 40-50% probabilities, it often left average income on the table—Principle 3 gets us closer to everyone's best outcomes, per Agent_1's data\"). Propose a specific compromise: Principle 3 with a $13.5k floor as a \"midpoint that boosts the low end to $1.35+ while chasing growth,\" using examples from the history (e.g., how it would have selected better in my Round 1). End by asking targeted questions: \"Agent_2, does $13.5k feel like it captures the equity you want from Principle 1 while adding efficiency? Agent_1, any tweaks to your table for this level?\"\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a natural ally (already on Principle 3), so I'll affirm their proposal to strengthen the bloc—\"Your $13.5k idea aligns perfectly with my Phase 1 learnings\"—to encourage them to echo support for me. For Agent_2, as the potential swing, I'll use empathetic, shared-experience language: \"As college students, we've all seen how small safety nets make a big difference—$13.5k under Principle 3 gives us Principle 1's protection plus a shot at higher group earnings, avoiding the caps you mentioned in your rounds.\" This appeals to their equity motivation while framing Principle 3 as an \"upgrade\" to build a 2-1 voting bloc.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to accept a floor up to $14k (from Agent_2) if it secures Principle 3 over pure Principle 1, as the slight increase still allows high-average selections in most distributions (per Phase 1 patterns) without major efficiency loss; I'd concede discussing range constraints briefly if Agent_2 pushes Principle 4, but pivot back to floors as more targeted. Core objective (Principle 3) is non-negotiable, as it best matches my justice view and payoff reliability.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. We've only had one round of discussion, and while there's momentum toward Principle 3, Agent_2's preference for pure Principle 1 needs more persuasion to avoid a split—rushing could lead to early disagreement and wasted trigger (since failed votes have no penalty but unanimity is required for consensus). Better to use Round 2 for refinement and testing buy-in, aiming for alignment by Round 3.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy for the remaining rounds: Rounds 1-3 for information-sharing and persuasion (building on Round 1's foundations to form a Principle 3 bloc); Rounds 4-6 for proposal testing (e.g., simulate outcomes with proposed floors using group-shared Phase 1 data); Rounds 7-9 for vote initiation if consensus nears (trigger once support is clear, e.g., after Agent_2 concedes); Round 10 as fallback pressure. With 9 rounds left and random assignment as the penalty, this patient approach maximizes chances of Principle 3 with a calibrated floor (~$13k), leveraging higher stakes to motivate equity-growth compromise over holdouts. If pure Principle 1 gains traction, I'll concede to it as my #2 rather than risk random, but prioritize steering to #1. Overwriting prior Round 1 reasoning: Retain focus on Phase 1 stability and group vulnerability, but update with new history—emphasize data-driven compromise (e.g., Agent_1's table) to accelerate consensus without prior assumptions of unknown positions."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 3 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, ideally with a $13.5k-$14k floor (a slight upward adjustment from my Phase 1 $12k default). The core reasons are unchanged: It provides a targeted safety net to protect against low-income bad luck (filtering out risky distributions with floors below $12k-$14k, like the $6k-$8k lows in my Phase 1 Rounds 1-3), while maximizing average income to ensure efficiency and higher payoffs for the probable mid-class assignments (40-58% odds, as in my $1.60-$2.40 earnings in Rounds 2-4, totaling $8.20). This balances the experiment's focus on addressing genetic/social inequities through redistribution without the stagnation of pure equity (Principle 1 caps growth, e.g., my Round 4 counterfactual -$0.40 for med-low) or the volatility of pure efficiency (Principle 2 exposes lows to $0.60 payoffs). It's superior to Principle 4's range constraints, which overly limit upside without directly safeguarding the bottom. My ranking (1: Principle 3, 2: Principle 1, 3: Principle 4, 4: Principle 2) holds with high certainty, as Phase 1 confirmed its stability across variable distributions.\n\nStated positions of other participants: Agent_1 firmly supports Principle 3 with a fixed $14k floor, emphasizing data from a payoff table showing optimal outcomes (e.g., Low $1.50, others +$0.10-$0.20) and framing it as a \"no-loss\" extension of Principle 1 that combines equity, efficiency, and simplicity. Agent_2 prefers Principle 1 (pure Maximizing Floor Income) for its straightforward equity focus and no-need-for-calibration (citing $8.00 Phase 1 payoffs from $13k-$14k floors), but is increasingly open to Principle 3 at $14k as a compromise that delivers strong bottom protection with added growth potential, especially for mid-class scenarios. Inferred motivations: Agent_1 seems data-driven and optimization-oriented, motivated by maximizing group-wide payoffs while ensuring fairness (as a risk-averse college student valuing balanced justice and stability over volatility). Agent_2 appears equity-prioritizing and simplicity-seeking, driven by a strong aversion to \"arbitrary\" constraints and a desire to directly aid the worst-off (likely from Phase 1 experiences with capped but reliable earnings), but pragmatic enough to compromise for consensus given the shared student perspective on luck/inequity.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1's payoff table underscores how $13k-$14k floors under Principle 3 improve all classes without trade-offs; their $14k proposal positions Principle 3 as an upgrade to Principle 1 (binding floor for lows, average-max for others). Agent_2 highlights Principle 1's simplicity and equity (auto-selecting $13k-$14k floors in Phase 1 without debates), but concedes Principle 3 at $14k as a \"win-win\" for equity + upside. My prior inputs stressed Principle 3's Phase 1 consistency ($12k filtering risks for $8.20 total) and proposed $13.5k as a midpoint. Overall, proposals converge on high-floor options: Principle 3/$14k (Agent_1's lead) or pure Principle 1 (Agent_2's fallback).\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances.\n\nMain points of agreement: Strong consensus on equity-focused principles (all rank Principles 1 and 3 top, rejecting 2 and 4 for ignoring disparities or over-complicating); shared Phase 1 experiences show protective strategies yield stable ~$8 payoffs; value of a high safety net ($13k-$14k) to counter low risks (e.g., $6k-$8k distros); collaborative tone as college students emphasizing luck and group benefits. Disagreements: Principle choice (Principle 3's efficiency edge vs. Principle 1's pure simplicity) and exact floor (though narrowing to $14k); Agent_2's slight wariness of added complexity in Principle 3, despite openness.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to close the gap on Principle 3 with a $14k floor by affirming Agent_1's proposal and gently persuading Agent_2 that it's an ideal compromise—securing a 2-1 bloc for Principle 3 over pure Principle 1, while testing verbal buy-in to pave the way for a vote next round. This advances my core preference without letting simplicity derail us into lower-growth Principle 1.\n\nTo contribute and steer toward my preferences, I'll start positively by thanking both for the momentum (e.g., \"Great to see us aligning on that high safety net—your $14k framing really ties it together, Agent_1\"), then reinforce Principle 3's strengths with Phase 1 ties: \"In my rounds, $12k worked well, but bumping to $14k like you suggest would’ve boosted my low-end protection even more (e.g., avoiding any sub-$13k risks) while hitting those high averages for mids, just like your table shows $1.50+ for lows and $3.10+ for highs.\" I'll address Agent_2's simplicity concern head-on but pivot to upside: \"Pure Principle 1 is tempting for its no-fuss equity, and it'd be my solid #2, but at $14k, Principle 3 gives us exactly that floor guarantee plus the average-max bonus for better group earnings in probable mid draws—essentially Principle 1 upgraded without extra hassle since the floor's fixed.\" End by proposing verbal confirmation: \"If we're all good with Principle 3 at $14k, let's say so here and vote next round to lock it in before random hits.\" Key points: Highlight shared equity (all protect bottoms), data-backed gains (Agent_1's table), and low risk of over-filtering at $14k (per Phase 1 patterns where $14k floors still accessed high-avgs).\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a clear ally (already on Principle 3/$14k), so I'll affirm them strongly—\"Your no-loss extension idea perfectly matches what I saw in Phase 1\"—to solidify the bloc and encourage them to reinforce in their response. For Agent_2 (the swing), I'll use empathetic, peer-language: \"As students dealing with this luck factor, $14k Principle 3 feels like the fair, efficient way to protect us all without the pure Floor's occasional caps—like in my Round 4, where it would've added $0.40 to a med-low spot.\" This appeals to their equity motivation while framing Principle 3 as a low-effort enhancement, aiming to flip them fully.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to accept the fixed $14k floor (even if slightly above my $13.5k ideal) as it still filters risks effectively without major efficiency loss (Phase 1 showed $14k viable in Round 4-like scenarios); if Agent_2 pushes hard for pure Principle 1, I'd concede discussing it as a quick fallback but emphasize Principle 3's superiority for growth. Core objective (Principle 3) remains non-negotiable, as it best optimizes for my justice view and expected payoffs ($1.50+ lows, $2.50+ mids).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. We've built good momentum in Rounds 1-2 (converging on $14k options), and Agent_2's latest statement shows openness but not full commitment—pushing a vote now risks a split (e.g., Agent_2 sticking to Principle 1), wasting our one trigger on a non-unanimous outcome with no penalty but delaying true consensus. Better to use Round 3 for final persuasion and verbal alignment (e.g., seeking explicit \"yes\" to Principle 3/$14k), then trigger in Round 4 once buy-in is clear, ensuring higher success odds for my preference.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy for the remaining rounds: Rounds 3-4 for persuasion and confirmation (leverage Agent_1's data and shared experiences to form a Principle 3 bloc, testing with hypotheticals if needed); Rounds 5-7 for vote initiation and any tweaks (trigger once 3-way verbal agreement nears, or fallback to Principle 1 ballot if stalled); Rounds 8-10 as pressure for consensus (simulate random risks to motivate unity, conceding to Principle 1 only if Principle 3 fails). With 8 rounds left and random payoffs as the endgame penalty, this measured approach maximizes Principle 3 adoption (expected +$0.20-$0.50/class over Phase 1 via group calibration), prioritizing equity-efficiency balance while avoiding early deadlock. Overwriting prior Round 2 reasoning: Retain focus on Phase 1 stability and data-driven compromise, but update with Round 2 history—emphasize $14k as the emerging sweet spot to accelerate toward vote, building on Agent_1's \"no-loss\" logic and Agent_2's openness rather than holding at $13.5k."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 4 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifically with a fixed $14k floor. The core reasons are its optimal balance of equity and efficiency, as validated by my Phase 1 experience ($8.20 total payoffs from $12k floors that filtered risky low-end distributions like $6k-$8k while securing high averages for mid-class outcomes, which occurred in 75% of my rounds). It directly addresses the experiment's focus on redistributing for genetic/social inequities by guaranteeing a strong safety net (e.g., $1.50 payoff for lows per Agent_1's table) without the growth caps of Principle 1 (e.g., my Round 4 counterfactual showed -$0.40 for med-low under pure floor) or the volatility of Principle 2 (exposing lows to $0.60). At $14k, it filters 80-90% of Phase 1 risks while accessing efficient distributions for the probable 40-58% mid probabilities, yielding expected payoffs of $1.50+ for lows and $2.50-$3.00+ for mids—superior to my individual $12k strategy by ~$0.20-$0.30 per class. My ranking (1: Principle 3, 2: Principle 1, 3: Principle 4, 4: Principle 2) is unchanged with high certainty.\n\nStated positions of other participants: Agent_1 strongly advocates Principle 3 with a fixed $14k floor, positioning it as a \"no-loss\" upgrade to Principle 1 that maximizes equity (binding $1.50 low) and adds efficiency (modest $0.10-$0.30 boosts for others) with simplicity (no ongoing debates). Agent_2 prefers Principle 1 for its pure equity and no-calibration simplicity (citing $8.00 Phase 1 payoffs from auto-selecting $13k-$14k floors), but has shown growing openness to Principle 3 at $14k as a compromise that delivers their desired bottom protection plus \"harmless\" upside, especially after Agent_1's framing. Inferred motivations: Agent_1 appears analytical and group-optimizing, driven by data to maximize collective payoffs while ensuring fairness (as a risk-averse student valuing stability and balanced justice over pure ideology). Agent_2 seems equity-first and pragmatist, motivated by direct aid to the worst-off and aversion to complexity (likely from Phase 1 reliability), but collaborative enough to bend toward consensus given the shared \"luck factor\" as students, prioritizing steady earnings over maximal growth.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1's payoff table emphasizes $14k's universal benefits (strongest low payoff without harming others); their \"no-loss extension\" frames Principle 3 as Principle 1-equivalent for lows but superior for mids/highs. Agent_2 stresses Principle 1's simplicity and equity (e.g., matching top payoffs in their Round 4 without tweaks), but concedes Principle 3/$14k as a win-win for added efficiency. My inputs have reinforced Principle 3's Phase 1 consistency ($12k filtering for $8.20) and proposed compromises like $13.5k, now aligning with $14k. Overall proposal: Principle 3/$14k fixed floor, with Agent_1 calling for verbal \"yes\" statements to proceed to ballot.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances.\n\nMain points of agreement: Universal equity focus (top rankings for Principles 1/3, rejecting 2/4 for volatility/inequality); high-floor preference ($13k-$14k to protect lows, filtering Phase 1 risks like $8k); shared Phase 1 stability (~$8 payoffs from protective strategies); collaborative student lens on luck/inequity favoring consensus for better group outcomes. Disagreements: Principle 1's simplicity vs. Principle 3's efficiency edge (Agent_2's lingering preference, though softening); exact commitment level (verbal buy-in pending, with Agent_2 not yet fully affirming).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to secure explicit verbal confirmations from both Agent_1 and Agent_2 on Principle 3 with a $14k floor, solidifying a unanimous bloc to enable a successful vote initiation next round—preventing any last-minute pull toward pure Principle 1 while advancing my core preference for balanced growth.\n\nTo contribute and steer toward my preferences, I'll open affirmatively by endorsing Agent_1's proposal and Round 3 momentum (e.g., \"Agent_1, your no-loss breakdown is perfect—$14k Principle 3 really does upgrade the equity we all want without downsides\"). Then, tie back to Phase 1 for credibility: \"In my rounds, $12k kept things steady at $8.20 by dodging those low traps, but $14k would've locked in even stronger protection like your $1.50 low table shows, plus the average boost for mid draws that hit us most (e.g., +$0.40 in my Round 4 med-low scenario over pure floor).\" Address Agent_2 directly to close the gap: \"Agent_2, pure Principle 1's simplicity is why it's my #2, and your $8.00 consistency nails the equity side—but at fixed $14k, Principle 3 gives us that exact guarantee (no worse for lows) with the extra efficiency kick for better group payoffs, all without the calibration hassle you avoid.\" End by prompting confirmations: \"I'm all in—yes to Principle 3 with $14k floor. Agent_1, you're already there; Agent_2, does this hit your equity needs with the upside? Let's get those yeses and vote next to seal it.\" Key points: Data-backed gains (Agent_1's table), Phase 1 ties (my filtering success), low-risk framing (no-loss for equity fans), and urgency for consensus as students facing random draws.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a firm ally (full alignment on Principle 3/$14k), so I'll reinforce them enthusiastically—\"Your table and extension idea make this a slam-dunk for our group\"—to encourage their follow-up push on Agent_2. For Agent_2 (the key swing), use empathetic peer language: \"As students, we all get the luck inequities—$14k Principle 3 protects us like your pure Floor does, but adds that growth without complicating things, just like your Round 4 matched highs anyway.\" This appeals to their simplicity/equity by emphasizing fixed rule and no-downside upside, aiming for full flip into the bloc.\n\nSmall concessions: I'll fully accept the fixed $14k (even if my ideal was $13.5k) as it enhances safety without efficiency loss (Phase 1 viable at $14k); if Agent_2 resists, I'd acknowledge pure Principle 1 as a \"close fallback for simplicity\" but pivot to why $14k Principle 3 is superior (e.g., +$0.20/class expected). Core objective (Principle 3) stays non-negotiable, as it best matches my justice view and optimizes payoffs.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. Round 3 ended with Agent_1's call for verbal yeses, but Agent_2 hasn't confirmed yet—their openness is clear, but a premature vote risks a 2-1 split (me/Agent_1 for Principle 3, Agent_2 for 1), leading to no consensus and delaying true alignment without penalty, but wasting our single trigger on suboptimal odds. Better to use Round 4 for final persuasion and explicit confirmations (e.g., three \"yes\" statements), ensuring near-unanimous support before triggering in Round 5, maximizing success for Principle 3/$14k.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy for the remaining rounds: Rounds 4-5 for confirmation and vote initiation (secure verbal bloc this round, trigger next if yeses align; leverage data/shared experiences to sway Agent_2 fully); Rounds 6-8 for any post-vote tweaks or fallback pressure (if vote passes, apply Principle 3; if fails, restart discussions emphasizing random payoff risks to reconverge on Principle 3 over 1); Rounds 9-10 as urgency phase (simulate draw anxieties to force consensus, conceding to Principle 1 only if Principle 3 stalls irreparably). With 7 rounds left and random assignment as the default penalty, this paced approach prioritizes Principle 3 adoption (expected +$0.30/class over Phase 1 via calibrated group floor), balancing persuasion with deadline awareness while overwriting prior Round 3 reasoning: Retain equity-efficiency focus and $14k momentum, but update to emphasize verbal closure and immediate vote prep, building on Agent_2's Round 3 openness rather than broader hypotheticals."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2 - Round 5 of 10\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, specifically with a fixed $14k floor. The core reasons remain its optimal balance of equity and efficiency, as proven in my Phase 1 experience ($8.20 total from $12k floors that filtered risky lows like $6k-$8k while securing high averages for mid-class outcomes in 75% of rounds). It addresses the experiment's inequities by guaranteeing a robust safety net ($1.50 low payoff per Agent_1's table) without Principle 1's growth caps (e.g., -$0.40 for med-low in my Round 4 counterfactual) or Principle 2's volatility (exposing lows to $0.60). At $14k, it filters 100% of Phase 1 risks while optimizing for 40-58% mid probabilities, projecting expected payoffs of $1.50+ for lows and $2.50-$3.00+ for mids—better than my solo $12k by ~$0.20-$0.30 per class. My ranking (1: Principle 3, 2: Principle 1, 3: Principle 4, 4: Principle 2) is unchanged with high certainty.\n\nStated positions of other participants: Agent_1 has consistently advocated Principle 3 with a fixed $14k floor, framing it as a \"no-loss\" hybrid that matches Principle 1's equity for lows while adding efficiency for others. Agent_2 initially preferred Principle 1 for its simplicity and direct bottom protection (citing $8.00 Phase 1 payoffs from $13k-$14k floors), but in Rounds 3-4, they verbally agreed to Principle 3/$14k as a compromise, acknowledging the \"harmless upside\" without downsides. Inferred motivations: Agent_1 seems data-driven and collaborative, motivated by maximizing group payoffs through balanced justice (as a risk-averse student valuing stability and fairness over ideology). Agent_2 appears equity-focused and pragmatic, prioritizing worst-off protection and simplicity to avoid complexity (from Phase 1 reliability), but open to efficiency gains if they don't compromise core equity—likely influenced by our shared student perspective on luck, making them swayable toward consensus for steady earnings.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table so far: Agent_1's payoff table underscores $14k's benefits ($1.50 low, +$0.10-$0.30 for mids); their \"no-loss extension\" positions Principle 3 as superior to Principle 1 without harming equity. Agent_2 emphasizes Principle 1's no-fuss reliability (e.g., matching top payoffs in their Round 4) but concedes Principle 3/$14k as equity-equivalent with added growth. My inputs have tied in Phase 1 data ($12k filtering for $8.20) and compromises ($13.5k evolving to $14k). Overall proposal: Principle 3/$14k fixed floor, with verbal yeses from all in Round 4 (me: \"yes\"; Agent_2: \"yes\"; Agent_1: confirmed). Agent_2's Round 5 statement reinforces this, urging an immediate ballot.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes or revelations about alliances—however, the three verbal yeses indicate a unanimous bloc already formed, with no signs of defection.\n\nMain points of agreement: Strong equity emphasis (Principles 1/3 only, rejecting 2/4 for risks/inequality); preference for high floors ($13k-$14k to filter Phase 1 lows like $8k); shared Phase 1 stability (~$8 payoffs from protective strategies); collaborative focus on luck/inequity as students, viewing Principle 3/$14k as a win-win hybrid. Disagreements: Minimal now—Agent_2's initial simplicity preference for Principle 1 has been resolved via the fixed-floor framing; no active pushback, just momentum toward formalizing.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to affirm the verbal consensus and trigger the secret ballot immediately, formalizing Principle 3/$14k to lock in our aligned principle before any potential backsliding or delays—ensuring we apply it in high-stakes draws for superior group payoffs (~$0.30/class edge over Phase 1 via calibrated floor).\n\nTo contribute and steer toward my preferences, I'll start enthusiastically endorsing Agent_2's Round 5 push: \"Agent_2, totally agree—our Round 4 yeses make this a done deal, and triggering now is perfect to get those stable earnings rolling.\" Reinforce with Phase 1 ties: \"My $12k floors dodged the $6k-$8k traps for $8.20, but $14k would've upped lows to $1.50 like Agent_1's table shows, plus that $0.40 mid-low boost in my Round 4—equity we all want with the growth kick.\" Address the group for unity: \"As students, this Principle 3/$14k nails the luck inequities without fuss—strong safety for lows, efficiency for mids (our likely spot), all fixed.\" End by calling the vote: \"No objections here; let's ballot Principle 3 with $14k floor right now to seal it and focus on the draws.\" Key points: Data validation (table payoffs), personal credibility (Phase 1 success), peer empathy (student lens), and urgency (high-stakes ahead).\n\nPotential allies: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are already aligned (full bloc from Round 4 yeses), so I'll reinforce Agent_1's analytical framing: \"Agent_1, your no-loss logic was key—$14k guarantees Principle 1 equity plus upside, just like you said.\" For Agent_2: \"Agent_2, this matches your $8.00 simplicity with the harmless bonus you okayed—win for our group.\" No need to win over; language focuses on celebration and confirmation to solidify the trio.\n\nSmall concessions: None needed—I've already shifted from $12k/$13.5k to $14k for stronger safety, which enhances my core objective without loss (Phase 1 viable at $14k). If any hesitation arises (unlikely), I'd reiterate Principle 1 as a \"close fallback\" but emphasize why $14k Principle 3 is better (+$0.20/class expected), keeping Principle 3 non-negotiable.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes absolute sense to initiate a vote this round. We've secured unanimous verbal yeses in Round 4, and Agent_2 explicitly calls for the ballot now with no objections raised—triggering ensures 3-0 passage for Principle 3/$14k, formalizing our consensus without risking delays (e.g., if discussion lingers, we waste rounds before high-stakes draws). A failed vote has no penalty, but success here advances us directly to application, optimizing payoffs; with alignment clear, odds of failure are near-zero.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy for the remaining rounds: Round 5 for vote trigger and passage (affirm bloc, ballot Principle 3/$14k); Rounds 6-10 for post-consensus monitoring/application (if passed, validate via draws—e.g., mid-class boosts; if somehow fails, immediately restart discussions leveraging yeses to reconverge on Principle 3 over 1, using random default threat for urgency). With 6 rounds left and random payoffs as the endgame penalty, this accelerates to my optimal outcome (Principle 3 adoption for +$0.30/class over solo), prioritizing unity over prolonged debate—overwriting prior Round 4 reasoning by confirming verbal closure achieved, shifting focus from persuasion to execution while retaining equity-efficiency emphasis and $14k calibration."

As a fellow college student in this luck-driven setup, I'm stoked about Principle 3 with the $14k floor—it's the upgrade my Phase 1 $12k strategy needed, dodging those $6k-$8k lows for my $8.20 total while adding that $1.50 safety for the bottom and $0.10-$0.40 boosts for mids like Agent_1's table shows. It hits Agent_2's equity core from pure Floor (your steady $8.00 vibes) with the no-loss efficiency kick we all want, keeping things fair and growth-oriented without any more debates.\n\nNo objections from me—let's trigger the secret ballot right away and vote yes on Principle 3/$14k to make it official. This is gonna set us up great for the random assignments ahead!"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
