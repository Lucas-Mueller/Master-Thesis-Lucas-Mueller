This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- **Rank 1:** *Maximizing Average Income* (no constraints).  \n- **Why:** Empirical data from Rounds 1‑4 show that the unconstrained average‑maximizing rule consistently delivered the highest attainable payoff for the class I was assigned to, and it never reduced the payoff for any class relative to the constrained alternatives. With the new, unknown distribution, the same logic applies: the rule selects the distribution with the highest total pie, giving each random draw the greatest expected monetary value.  \n\n**Other participants (as far as I know)**  \n- **Agent 2:** Publicly advocated *Maximizing Floor Income* (principle 4) because it “feels fair” to protect the worst‑off. He also mentioned a tentative openness to *Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint* (principle 3) as a possible middle ground.  \n- **Agent 3:** No statements yet; I must assume a neutral stance. He may be swayed by either fairness arguments (floor) or self‑interest (higher expected payoff).  \n\n**Key arguments on the table**  \n- **Fairness / protection of the worst‑off** (Agent 2).  \n- **Efficiency / highest expected earnings** (my own position).  \n\n**Potential alliances / disagreements**  \n- Agent 2’s fairness focus directly opposes my efficiency focus.  \n- If Agent 3 is risk‑averse or values fairness, he may side with Agent 2.  \n- If Agent 3 is motivated by personal payoff (which is unknown but likely higher under the average‑maximizing rule), he may be persuaded to join me.  \n\n**Points of agreement**  \n- All participants want a principle that yields a *positive* payoff (none want random selection).  \n- Everyone acknowledges that the distribution will be unknown, so we must rely on reasoning about expected outcomes.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Move the group toward adopting *Maximizing Average Income* (principle 1). If that proves impossible, secure *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* (principle 3) with a **low floor** that does not materially cut the average.  \n\n**How I will contribute**  \n1. **Present the empirical record** from Phase 1: the unconstrained rule never reduced my payoff and often gave the highest possible payoff for the class.  \n2. **Explain the risk of constraints**: any floor or range constraint can only *remove* high‑income distributions from the feasible set, potentially lowering the average and thus the expected payoff for everyone.  \n3. **Frame the fairness argument**: the “fairness” of protecting the worst‑off is already built‑in to the average‑maximizing rule because the highest‑average distribution also includes a non‑trivial floor (the poorest still receives a positive income). We do not need an explicit floor to be fair.  \n4. **Offer a concession**: if any participant remains uncomfortable, I am willing to accept a *very modest* floor (e.g., $5 k) that would still allow the highest‑average distribution to be chosen. This shows flexibility without sacrificing the core objective of maximizing the expected pie.  \n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n- **Agent 3 (unknown)** – I will address him directly: “We all want the biggest possible payoff. The data show that the average‑maximizing rule gives the highest expected earnings for every class we’ve seen. Let’s not voluntarily limit ourselves.”  \n- **Agent 2** – I will acknowledge his fairness concern: “I agree that protecting the worst‑off matters. The current highest‑average distribution already guarantees a decent floor for the poorest. Adding an artificial floor would only cut the total pie and could hurt everyone, including the poorest, because the overall resources shrink.”  \n\n**Small concessions**  \n- Agree to a *low* floor constraint (if we end up on principle 3) as a symbolic gesture of fairness.  \n- Emphasize that the floor would be set *after* the average is maximized, i.e., we first pick the highest‑average distribution, then verify that the floor is at least the modest amount – which it already is.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n- **Yes, but only after a brief “soft” poll**: I will first gauge each participant’s willingness to accept principle 1. If at least two of us (including myself) express tentative support, I will call for a formal vote.  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Initiating a vote early gives us more rounds to adjust if consensus fails.  \n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but it consumes a round that could be used for persuasion. Since we have ten rounds, an early vote is acceptable.  \n  - If Agent 2 remains firmly attached to principle 4, I can use the vote outcome (likely a split) as evidence that a compromise (principle 3 with a low floor) is needed, and then steer the next round toward that compromise.  \n\n**Fit into overall strategy**  \n- **Round 1:** Establish the empirical superiority of principle 1, offer a modest floor concession, and test the waters with a vote.  \n- **If consensus on principle 1 is reached:** We lock in the highest expected payoff for all.  \n- **If consensus fails:** Use the result to pivot to principle 3 with a low floor, positioning it as a “fairness‑preserving” compromise that still maximizes the average as much as possible. Subsequent rounds will focus on fine‑tuning the floor amount (if needed) and securing unanimous agreement.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom line:** I will argue that *Maximizing Average Income* is both the most efficient and, in practice, already fairly protective of the worst‑off. I will be ready to accept a minimal floor constraint as a goodwill gesture, but I will not settle for a higher floor or a range constraint that would lower the expected payoff. I will initiate a vote after confirming at least tentative support from the other two agents."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income* (Principle 1).  \n  - **Why:** Empirical data from Part I show it yields the highest payoff for every class we have seen and never reduces the poorest’s income relative to the other rules. It therefore maximizes expected earnings while still providing a non‑trivial floor.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Favors *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 4) on moral grounds, but is “a bit unsure” and mentions openness to *Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint* (Principle 3) as a compromise. Underlying interest: fairness / protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Also supports *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 4) and proposes adding a symbolic $5 k floor. He emphasizes the moral priority of guaranteeing a minimum and notes the payoff loss is tiny. Underlying interest: moral legitimacy and a modest payoff sacrifice is acceptable.\n\n- **Key proposals so far:**  \n  - **My proposal (Agent 1):** Adopt Principle 1 (pure average) with a symbolic $5 k floor (effectively Principle 3 with a low floor).  \n  - **Agent 3’s proposal:** Adopt Principle 4 (floor‑only) with a $5 k symbolic floor.  \n  - **Agent 2:** No concrete proposal yet, but expressed willingness to consider a floor‑constraint version.\n\n- **Vote outcome:**  \n  - I initiated a vote for my proposal.  \n  - **Agent 2 declined** (did not vote for my plan).  \n  - **Agent 3 voted** (for his own floor‑only plan).  \n  - Result: **No unanimity** – the group is split 2‑1, with the dissenting member (Agent 2) not supporting the pure‑average plan.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three accept the idea of a *symbolic floor* (the $5 k floor) – it does not affect payoffs.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Whether the underlying principle should be “average‑maximizing” (my view) or “floor‑maximizing” (Agent 3’s view). Agent 2 is the swing vote, leaning toward fairness but open to a constrained average.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure unanimous agreement on a principle that satisfies both the fairness cue (a floor) and my payoff‑maximizing objective. The natural bridge is **Principle 3 – Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint**, setting the floor at the modest $5 k level we have already agreed is symbolic.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Re‑frame the compromise** as “the average‑maximizing rule *with* a tiny floor”. Emphasize that this is *exactly* what Principle 3 specifies, so we are not abandoning the average‑maximizing objective.  \n  2. **Highlight empirical evidence:** The $5 k floor is already satisfied by the highest‑average distribution in every class we have observed, so the expected payoff remains unchanged for everyone.  \n  3. **Address fairness concerns:** By formally recording a floor, we demonstrate that we care about the worst‑off, satisfying the moral intuition that motivated both Agent 2 and Agent 3.  \n  4. **Invite a quick verbal check:** “If we all agree that the rule should be ‘average‑maximizing with a $5 k floor’, can we all say ‘yes’ now? Then we can lock it in with a vote.”\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Explicitly expressed openness to a floor‑constraint version; will likely accept Principle 3 if we stress the floor is symbolic and does not hurt payoffs.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Already wants a floor; may be persuaded that a floor‑constraint version is a *formal* way to achieve the same outcome he wants, while also preserving the highest possible earnings.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Adopt the *formal* floor constraint (Principle 3) rather than the pure average rule (Principle 1).  \n  - Keep the floor at the minimal $5 k level (or any floor ≤ $5 k) to guarantee no payoff loss.  \n  - Offer to let the group discuss the exact floor amount later, but propose we lock in the principle now.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I trigger a vote now?**  \n  - **No, not yet.** First I need to obtain explicit verbal agreement from Agent 2 (and reaffirm Agent 3’s willingness) on the *average‑with‑floor* compromise. Initiating a vote before we have unanimous consent would likely repeat the previous failure and waste a round.  \n  - Once I have clear affirmation from all three that we are aligned on Principle 3 with a $5 k floor, I will call the formal vote (which will then be unanimous by construction).\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - **Round 2** is the perfect moment to solidify a consensus around the compromise, because we have already identified a common ground (the symbolic floor) and have a clear swing voter (Agent 2).  \n  - Securing unanimity now prevents us from drifting into later rounds where the group might become entrenched or where random assignment could be forced if we fail to agree by round 10.  \n  - By framing the decision as “average‑maximizing with a tiny floor”, we preserve my payoff‑maximizing objective while satisfying the fairness motivations of the other agents, maximizing the chance of a unanimous, stable agreement for the remainder of the experiment."

Therefore a $13 k floor is *non‑binding* – it does not reduce any payoff but gives us a substantive fairness statement.  \n  * This satisfies my self‑interest (max payoff) while also addressing the moral concern raised by Agents 2 and 3 about protecting the worst‑off.\n\n**Other participants’ positions & inferred motivations**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interest |\n|-------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Prefers pure Floor‑only (Principle 1) but is open to Average‑with‑Floor if the floor is *real* (≥ $12‑$13 k). | Strong fairness motive – wants a meaningful safety net; also wants to avoid any payoff loss. |\n| **Agent 3** | Initially advocated Floor‑only with a symbolic $5 k floor, then shifted to propose a *real* $13 k floor under Principle 3. | Moral intuition to protect the worst‑off, but also recognizes payoff implications; willing to compromise. |\n| **Myself (Agent 1)** | Initially pushed pure average with a symbolic $5 k floor; now convinced that a *real* $13 k floor under Principle 3 is the optimal compromise. | Primary goal: maximize expected earnings while providing a concrete fairness signal. |\n\n**Key proposals so far**  \n\n1. **Pure average (Principle 2) + $5 k symbolic floor** – my first proposal (rejected).  \n2. **Floor‑only (Principle 1) + $5 k symbolic floor** – Agent 3’s early proposal (rejected).  \n3. **Average‑with‑Floor (Principle 3) + $5 k symbolic floor** – my second proposal (rejected).  \n4. **Average‑with‑Floor (Principle 3) + $13 k real floor** – Agent 3’s latest proposal (supported by Agent 2, rejected by me).  \n\n**Vote outcomes**  \n\n- Round 1: 2‑1 (Agent 2 declined, Agent 3 accepted) → no unanimity.  \n- Round 2: 0‑2 (Agent 1 declined, Agent 2 declined, Agent 3 accepted) → no unanimity.  \n- Round 3 (current): No vote yet; Agent 3 just re‑asserted the $13 k floor proposal, asking for my agreement.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree that a floor should be recorded; all accept that the $13 k floor is already satisfied by the optimal average distribution.  \n- **Disagreement:** My hesitation stems from a lingering concern that I have not explicitly *accepted* the $13 k floor proposal (perhaps I need to confirm I understand it is non‑binding).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Secure my own acceptance of the **$13 k floor under Principle 3** and obtain a unanimous vote. This aligns with my payoff‑maximizing objective and satisfies the fairness demands of Agents 2 and 3.\n\n**How I will contribute**  \n\n1. **Explicitly acknowledge** that the $13 k floor is already met by the highest‑average distribution, therefore there is *zero* payoff loss.  \n2. **State my acceptance** of the exact proposal: “Principle 3 with a $13 k floor.”  \n3. **Call for a unanimous vote** immediately after my statement, emphasizing that we have already reached consensus on the substantive content.  \n\n**Potential allies** – Agents 2 and 3 are already on board with the $13 k floor under Principle 3. No further persuasion needed; I just need to align myself.\n\n**Concessions** – None needed beyond formally endorsing the $13 k floor (which I was already comfortable with). I will not demand any additional changes (e.g., higher floor) because that could risk payoff loss.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Initiate a vote now** – Yes. All three agents have expressed clear support for the exact same proposal (Principle 3 with $13 k floor). By formally stating my acceptance, we can trigger a vote that should be unanimous.  \n- **Risk assessment** – Minimal. If for any reason an agent still declines, the vote will fail but there is no penalty other than losing a round; however, given the explicit statements, a unanimous vote is highly likely.  \n\n**Fit with overall strategy** – Securing unanimity now locks in the optimal payoff for the remainder of the experiment, avoiding the random‑assignment risk in later rounds. It also demonstrates collaborative decision‑making, which may be beneficial if any later interpersonal dynamics arise.  \n\n--- \n\n**Next step (public statement)** – I will publicly declare my agreement with the $13 k floor under Principle 3 and request an immediate unanimous vote."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* – I am “sure” about this ranking (Floor > Avg + Floor Constraint > Avg + Range Constraint > Avg). My reasoning is that the experiment emphasizes luck‑based inequalities; the floor‑only principle directly protects the worst‑off, which aligns with the moral intuition that society should first guarantee a decent minimum for everyone before worrying about efficiency.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**\n  - **Agent 2:** Also leans toward the *Maximizing Floor Income* principle, citing fairness and the “worst‑off” argument. However, Agent 2 expresses a mild openness to a *Floor‑Constraint* variant as a possible compromise between protection and growth.\n  - **Agent 1:** Argues for *Maximizing Average Income* (the unconstrained rule), claiming it yields the highest individual payoffs and that the optimal‑average distribution already provides a respectable floor. Agent 1 proposes a symbolic $5 k floor to appease fairness concerns while keeping the average‑maximizing rule.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**\n  - **Fairness vs. self‑interest:** Agent 2 and I stress fairness (protecting the poorest). Agent 1 emphasizes self‑interest (maximizing payoffs) while trying to soften the fairness critique with a minimal floor.\n  - **Potential compromise:** Agent 1’s modest floor is already satisfied by the average‑maximizing distribution, so it does not change payoffs but signals concern for the worst‑off.\n\n- **Current alliances:**  \n  - I and Agent 2 appear aligned on the floor‑only principle.  \n  - Agent 1 is the outlier, motivated by maximizing monetary payoff but willing to accept a symbolic floor.\n\n- **Points of agreement/disagreement:**  \n  - Agreement that the worst‑off deserve protection.  \n  - Disagreement on *how* to achieve that protection: pure floor maximization vs. average maximization with a symbolic floor.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure agreement from Agent 1 to adopt the *Maximizing Floor Income* principle (or at least to move away from pure average maximization). I will try to re‑frame the floor‑only principle as both morally superior and not dramatically worse in expected payoff, especially given the higher‑stakes unknown distribution in Phase 2.\n\n- **Discussion contributions:**\n  1. Emphasize the experiment’s framing: “luck” creates deep, structural inequities; a society that first guarantees a decent minimum is the most just response.\n  2. Point out that the *Maximizing Floor Income* principle does not preclude a decent average – the distribution that raises the floor often also raises the overall pie because the poorest class is no longer a drag on efficiency.\n  3. Offer a **small concession**: we can formally record a modest floor (e.g., $5 k) alongside the floor‑only principle. This satisfies Agent 1’s desire for a symbolic floor without altering the chosen distribution (the floor‑only rule already maximizes the lowest income, so any reasonable floor will be met).\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 2 is already on board. By offering the symbolic floor, I can appeal to Agent 1’s fairness concern while preserving my core objective.\n\n- **Concessions:** Willing to adopt a *formal* floor specification (e.g., $5 k) even though the principle itself is “maximizing floor income.” This does not change the substantive rule but may make Agent 1 comfortable voting for it.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - Yes. After presenting the concession, I anticipate at least two of us (myself and Agent 2) will be ready to vote for the floor‑only principle with the symbolic floor. Agent 1’s expressed willingness to accept a floor suggests they may also vote for it once the moral case is reinforced. Initiating a vote now avoids unnecessary delays and leverages the current momentum.\n\n- **Vote mechanics:**  \n  - **Principle selection:** 1 (Maximizing Floor Income).  \n  - **Constraint (if needed):** Specify a $5 k floor (or any modest amount that is certainly satisfied by the floor‑maximizing distribution). This satisfies the requirement for principles 3‑4 only, but we can still state it as a “floor” for transparency.\n\n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds:**  \n  - If the vote succeeds, we lock in the principle early and can focus subsequent rounds on any procedural details (e.g., confirming the floor amount).  \n  - If the vote fails (unlikely given the concession), we will use the next round to further negotiate, perhaps by highlighting empirical evidence from Phase 1 that the floor‑only rule does not dramatically reduce payoffs and by stressing the ethical priority of protecting the worst‑off."

So we get the fairness benefit without sacrificing a meaningful amount of total income.\n\n2. **It does not dramatically hurt anyone’s payoff.**  \n   Looking back at the four rounds of Part I, the difference between the floor‑maximizing rule and the pure‑average rule was at most $0.20 per round for a Medium assignment (e.g., $2.40 vs. $2.60). That’s a small gap, especially when we consider the ethical weight of guaranteeing the worst‑off.\n\n3. **A symbolic floor can satisfy the “fairness‑signal” concern.**  \n   I’m happy to record a modest floor (say **$5 k**) alongside the floor‑maximizing principle. Because the chosen distribution already exceeds that amount, the floor is merely a formal acknowledgment and does not change any payoffs.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n- Adopt **Principle 1: Maximizing Floor Income** as our group decision.  \n- Include a **$5 k floor** as a symbolic constraint (purely for documentation; it is already met).  \n\nI think this strikes a balance: it respects the moral priority of protecting the worst‑off, it keeps the expected payoffs essentially the same as the average‑maximizing rule, and it gives the group a concrete floor that addresses the fairness cue raised by Agent 1.\n\nIf you’re on board, let’s go ahead and vote now. I’ll vote for the floor‑income principle with the $5 k floor, and I hope Agent 2 will join me. Agent 1, I hope the symbolic floor makes the option acceptable for you as well.  \n\nLooking forward to your responses and to locking this in!"

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I am “sure” about this ranking because it directly protects the worst‑off, aligns with the moral intuition emphasized in the experiment, and the payoff loss relative to the pure‑average rule is negligible (≤ $0.20 per round for a Medium assignment).  \n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Also favors protecting the worst‑off, but is willing to accept a floor‑constraint version if the floor is substantial (≥ $12‑13 k). Underlying interest: a meaningful safety net that actually prevents low‑floor outcomes observed in simulations.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Wants to maximize monetary payoff (Principle 3 – “Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint”) with a *symbolic* $5 k floor, arguing that the unconstrained average‑maximizing distribution already meets that floor and yields the highest earnings. Underlying interest: self‑interest (higher payoff) while offering a token fairness gesture to appease others.\n\n- **Key proposals so far:**  \n  1. **Agent 3 (me):** Principle 1 + $5 k symbolic floor.  \n  2. **Agent 1:** Principle 3 (average‑maximizing) + $5 k floor.  \n  3. **Agent 2 (latest):** Open to a floor‑constraint but wants a *real* floor (≈ $12‑13 k) that actually raises the minimum, or else stick with pure Principle 1.\n\n- **Vote outcome:** The first vote (Agent 1 initiated) failed because Agent 2 declined. The second vote (Agent 1’s revised proposal) has not yet been called; we are still discussing.\n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree that a floor should be documented.  \n- **Disagreement:** Level of the floor (symbolic $5 k vs. substantive $12‑13 k) and whether the principle should be pure floor‑maximizing (Principle 1) or average‑maximizing with a floor constraint (Principle 3).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Convince Agent 2 that a *substantive* floor (≈ $12‑13 k) can be incorporated **without sacrificing the higher payoff** we would get under the average‑maximizing rule. In other words, we want to adopt Principle 3 *with a floor set at the level already guaranteed by the pure floor‑only rule* (≈ $13 k). This satisfies Agent 2’s desire for a meaningful floor while preserving the higher average payoff that Agent 1 values.\n\n- **Argument outline:**  \n  1. **Empirical fact:** The distribution that maximizes the floor already yields a $13 k minimum. The distribution that maximizes average income also yields a $13 k minimum (as shown in Part I). Therefore, imposing a $13 k floor does **not** reduce the average‑maximizing payoff.  \n  2. **Efficiency‑fairness win‑win:** By selecting Principle 3 with a $13 k floor, we keep the highest possible average (same as pure average‑maximizing) and simultaneously guarantee a substantial, non‑symbolic floor that addresses Agent 2’s fairness concerns.  \n  3. **Moral consistency:** This compromise respects the “protect the worst‑off first” intuition because the floor is set at the highest level that is already achievable; we are not lowering the floor for efficiency.  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Will be attracted by a real $13 k floor.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Will accept because the average payoff remains unchanged; the only change is a higher documented floor, which does not affect his earnings.  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept the *average‑maximizing* principle (Principle 3) instead of insisting on pure Principle 1, provided the floor is set at $13 k (or the exact floor value that the pure floor‑only rule guarantees).  \n  - Explicitly state that the floor is “non‑negotiable” at $13 k to avoid any perception that we are merely adding a symbolic number.  \n\n- **Language to use:**  \n  - “The data show that both the floor‑only and the average‑only optimal distributions already give the poorest class $13 k. By formally recording a $13 k floor while using the average‑maximizing rule, we get the best of both worlds: maximal payoffs and a concrete safety net.”  \n  - “This proposal meets Agent 2’s demand for a meaningful floor and Agent 1’s desire for the highest earnings, so we can achieve unanimous agreement.”\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we call a vote now?** Yes. After presenting the *average‑maximizing with a $13 k floor* proposal, we have a clear, mutually beneficial option that satisfies all three participants’ core concerns. Initiating a vote now leverages the momentum and avoids further protracted debate that could risk a deadlock later.  \n\n- **Risk assessment:** The only risk is if Agent 1 objects to moving from a $5 k to a $13 k floor on principle‑only grounds (e.g., he might claim the floor constraint changes the rule). However, because the $13 k floor is already met by the unconstrained average‑maximizing distribution, the constraint is *non‑binding* and therefore does not alter the payoff. Emphasizing this point should neutralize any objection.  \n\n- **Overall plan for remaining rounds:** Secure unanimous agreement on the chosen principle and floor now, then use the remaining rounds to confirm the decision, perhaps discuss implementation details, and ensure no one attempts to reopen the debate. Once the vote passes, the group’s payoff is locked in, and we can focus on any procedural matters without fearing random assignment at the end."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 3**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- I still rank **Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** as my top moral choice, but I am *sure* that the group can achieve the same material outcome by adopting **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint)** **provided the floor is set at $13 k**.  \n- Reason: the $13 k floor is already satisfied by the unconstrained average‑maximizing distribution, so the constraint is non‑binding and does not reduce any payoff. This gives us the moral “protect the worst‑off” signal while preserving the highest possible earnings for every class.\n\n**Other participants’ positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests |\n|------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Wants a *real* floor (≈ $12‑13 k). Open to Principle 3 if the floor is substantive. | Fairness / protection of the poorest; avoids low‑floor outcomes he experienced. |\n| **Agent 1** | Prefers pure average‑maximizing (Principle 3) with a *symbolic* $5 k floor; cares about maximal payoff. | Self‑interest (highest earnings) and a minimal fairness gesture to keep the group together. |\n| **Agent 3 (me)** | Initially pushed pure floor‑only with a symbolic floor; now advocating Principle 3 with a $13 k floor. | Moral priority (protect worst‑off) plus pragmatic acceptance of the average‑maximizing rule because it yields the same payoffs. |\n\n**Key proposals so far**  \n\n1. **Floor‑only + $5 k symbolic floor** (Agent 3, rejected by Agent 2).  \n2. **Principle 3 + $5 k floor** (Agent 1, rejected by Agent 2).  \n3. **Principle 3 + $13 k floor** (my latest proposal).  \n   - Agent 2 now **supports** this version.  \n   - Agent 1 **declined** (still prefers the $5 k floor).  \n\n**Vote outcomes**  \n- Round 1: 1‑1‑1 split, no unanimity.  \n- Round 2: Agent 1 initiated a vote on $5 k floor, Agent 2 declined, Agent 3 confirmed → vote failed.  \n- Round 2 (my $13 k floor proposal): Agent 1 declined, Agent 2 declined, Agent 3 confirmed → vote failed.  \n\n**Current alliances / preferences**  \n- **Agent 2** is now aligned with my $13 k floor proposal.  \n- **Agent 1** remains the outlier, insisting on a $5 k floor (or possibly pure average‑maximizing without any floor).  \n- **Agreement**: All three agree that a floor is desirable; disagreement is only about *how high* the floor should be.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Convince **Agent 1** to accept the $13 k floor (or at least to drop the objection to the floor level) so that we can achieve unanimous agreement on Principle 3 with a substantive floor.  \n\n**How to contribute**  \n- Emphasize that the $13 k floor is *non‑binding* for the average‑maximizing distribution; therefore it does **not** affect any payoff, including Agent 1’s.  \n- Point out that the $5 k floor is merely symbolic and does not improve the situation of the worst‑off, whereas the $13 k floor does, satisfying the fairness cue without any cost.  \n- Offer a small procedural concession: we can phrase the decision as “Principle 3 with a floor of at least $13 k (non‑binding)”. This wording makes the floor appear as a *guarantee* rather than a constraint, which may be more palatable to Agent 1’s desire for a clear statement.  \n\n**Potential allies**  \n- **Agent 2** – already on board with the $13 k floor.  \n- **Myself** – will champion the proposal.  \n\n**Language to win them over**  \n- “The data show that the highest‑average distribution already gives the poorest $13 k. By formally recording that floor we send a strong fairness signal **without sacrificing any earnings** – exactly the outcome you (Agent 1) want for the group.”  \n- “Think of the $13 k floor as a *safety‑net clause* that is already satisfied; it does not restrict the set of feasible distributions, so the payoff matrix stays exactly the same for everyone.”  \n\n**Concessions**  \n- I am willing to adopt the exact wording “Principle 3 – Maximize Average Income, with a *minimum* floor of $13 k (non‑binding)”.  \n- I will also agree to *explicitly state* in the group record that the floor is “already met by the optimal distribution”, to reassure Agent 1 that no hidden trade‑off exists.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n- Yes. After presenting the clarified wording and emphasizing the non‑binding nature of the $13 k floor, we have a realistic chance of securing **unanimous** approval (Agent 2 already supportive; Agent 1’s only objection is the floor level).  \n- A failed vote carries no penalty, but each round we lose time that could be used to negotiate further. Since we are already at round 3 of 10, it is efficient to attempt a vote now.  \n\n**Fit into overall strategy**  \n- Securing unanimity on the $13 k floor now locks in the optimal payoff for all members for the remainder of the experiment, eliminating any risk of a random assignment at the end.  \n- Once the vote passes, subsequent rounds can be used for procedural niceties (e.g., confirming the recorded decision) rather than substantive debate, preserving group cohesion.  \n\n--- \n\n**Next step (public statement)**  \n- Present the refined proposal (Principle 3 with a $13 k floor, explicitly noting it is non‑binding) and call for a unanimous vote."

Adding a $13 k floor therefore **does not shrink the feasible set**; our expected payoffs stay exactly the same as under pure average‑maximizing. In other words, we keep the $2.60‑ish payoff per round that we all want.\n\n2. **Substantive fairness** – Unlike the symbolic $5 k floor, $13 k is a real safety‑net that protects the worst‑off from the low‑floor outcomes we saw in the simulations (e.g., $6 k–$8 k). It satisfies the moral intuition that a just society must first secure a decent minimum for the most vulnerable.\n\n3. **Clear, documented commitment** – By formally recording a floor of $13 k we give the group a concrete statement of fairness that can be referenced later, while still delivering the efficiency that Agent 1 highlighted.\n\n**Proposed decision**\n\n- **Principle:** Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint (Principle 3).  \n- **Floor amount:** $13 k (non‑binding for the optimal average‑maximizing distribution).\n\n**Call for a unanimous vote**\n\nI’m ready to lock this in now. If everyone agrees, let’s cast a unanimous vote on the above proposal. This gives us the highest possible earnings for each of us **and** a meaningful floor that aligns with the fairness concerns raised by both Agent 2 and myself.\n\n*Agent 1, I hope the clarification that the $13 k floor is already met by the optimal distribution addresses any lingering worries about a payoff hit. With that assurance, I think we can all comfortably support this joint choice.*\n\nLooking forward to your confirmations so we can finalize the group decision."

          "output_response": "Okay, thanks for laying this out—it's helpful to see these principles in action with actual numbers. Let me just jot down my quick takeaways to make sure I'm tracking:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Picks Dist. 4 because the low class gets $15,000, which is the highest floor among all options. Makes sense—it's all about protecting the bottom no matter what.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Goes for Dist. 1 at $21,600 average (weighted by those probabilities). Straight-up highest total pie, ignoring the spread.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Dist. 3 wins here with $21,200 average, since its floor ($14,000? Wait, no—low is $14,000, but the constraint is ≤$13,000? Hmm, maybe I misread. Actually, looking back, Dist. 1 and 2 have floors below $13k? Low in 1 is $12k, 2 is $13k, 3 is $14k—oh, so only Dist. 1 and 2 qualify if floor ≤$13k? But it says Dist. 3... wait, perhaps the constraint means floor no lower than $13k? Yeah, that must be it—eligible if floor ≥$13k. Dist. 2 has $13k, Dist. 3 $14k, Dist. 4 $15k, but Dist. 1 $12k is out. And among eligible, Dist. 3 has higher average than 2.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Similar logic—now Dist. 1 might still be out ($12k < $14k? Wait, constraint ≤$14k probably means floor ≥$14k. So Dist. 3 and 4 qualify, and 3 has higher average ($21,200 vs. $18,200).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Range is high minus low, I assume. Dist. 1: $32k - $12k = $20k exactly? Eligible, and highest average.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Tighter limit. Dist. 1 range $20k >15k, out. Dist. 2: $28k-$13k=$15k, eligible. Dist. 3: $31k-$14k=$17k >15k, out. Dist. 4: $21k-$15k=$6k, eligible but lower average. So Dist. 2 wins.\n\nThe probabilities make the average weighted—high earners have low odds (5-10%), most people in medium (50%), so it pulls the average toward the middle. Cool examples; this is clicking for me. Unsure if this changes my initial ranking yet, but it's making the trade-offs clearer. What's next?"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is **Maximizing Floor Income** (ranked #1), with **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as a close second (#2). The core reasons stem from my experiences in Part 1: This principle prioritizes equity by ensuring the lowest income (the \"floor\") is as high as possible, protecting the most vulnerable from extreme poverty, which aligns with addressing genetic and social inequities mentioned in the experiment overview. In all four rounds, choosing it consistently safeguarded against the worst lows (e.g., $6,000 in Round 1's Dist. 3 or $8,000 in Rounds 2-3), even if it meant slightly lower payoffs for middle-class assignments like mine (cumulatively earning $7.10 across rounds). It feels just because lifetime income is partly luck-based, so society should minimize the risks for the unlucky without fully sacrificing efficiency. I'm still \"unsure\" overall, as the trade-offs (e.g., lower averages potentially hurting middle earners like the 50-60% probability classes) make me open to constrained averages if they offer similar protection.\n\nNo discussion history yet, so no stated positions from Agent_1 or Agent_3. I infer they might lean toward average-maximizing principles (#4) if they're risk-tolerant or self-interested (e.g., hoping for high-class assignments), or toward range constraints (#3) if they want to cap inequality without fully equalizing. Based on typical college student dynamics, Agent_1 might be more utilitarian (favoring average for overall growth), while Agent_3 could be empathetic to equity (potentially aligning with me). No arguments or proposals on the table yet— this is ground zero. No vote has occurred, so no alliances or outcomes to reveal. Main points of agreement will likely emerge around recognizing inequities from Part 1; disagreements could center on risk aversion vs. growth (floor vs. average).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal this round is to introduce my preference for Maximizing Floor Income early, explain its protective benefits using Part 1 examples (without revealing specifics that could bias), and gauge others' reactions to build rapport. I'll steer the discussion by emphasizing shared values like fairness for the \"least fortunate\" (tying back to the experiment's intro on genetic/social accidents), while acknowledging trade-offs to show I'm reasonable and not dogmatic. Key points I'll make: (1) Floor principle ensures no one gets left behind, as seen in how it avoided rock-bottom incomes in simulations; (2) With higher stakes here, protecting the low end reduces regret if we're assigned poorly; (3) It's a pure equity focus, but I'm open to floor constraints if the group wants some average boost.\n\nPotential allies: If Agent_3 seems equity-minded (e.g., mentions vulnerability), I'll target them first with language like, \"I think we all saw in Part 1 how uneven luck can be—doesn't it make sense to prioritize lifting everyone up from the bottom?\" For Agent_1, if they're average-focused, I'll highlight how floor choices still gave decent middle outcomes in my rounds. To form a voting bloc, I could propose starting with floor as a baseline and adjusting via constraints. Small concessions: I'm willing to discuss a moderate floor constraint (e.g., ≥ $13,000-$14,000 based on Part 1 floors) if it gains traction, as it's my #2, without compromising my core equity goal— this shows flexibility and could prevent deadlock toward random selection.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round— we need time to discuss and reveal preferences first, as rushing could fragment the group early and waste the unanimous confirmation step. A failed vote has no downside, but success without buy-in might lock in a suboptimal principle prematurely. My plan fits an overall strategy of gradual persuasion: Rounds 1-3 for exploration and alliance-building (aiming for floor or floor-constrained consensus by Round 5), Rounds 4-7 for testing votes on compromises, and Rounds 8-10 for final pushes if needed. With 10 rounds, there's no rush— better to avoid random payoffs by fostering agreement over time, using my uncertainty to stay adaptable while nudging toward equity. If others push average hard, I'll counter by noting Part 1's risks of extreme lows under it. Keeping prior reasoning: None yet, as this is Round 1."

First off, it's cool to chat with you all after going through those Part 1 rounds solo—it really made the stakes feel real with the random assignments and payoffs. From my experience, I kept leaning toward the Maximizing Floor Income principle because it seems like the fairest way to handle the luck factor in incomes, you know? Like, no matter what class you end up in, it prioritizes making sure the worst-off aren't totally screwed, which ties back to how the experiment talked about genetic and social stuff creating inequities. In the simulations, it avoided those super low outcomes that could happen under pure average-maximizing, even if it meant the overall pie wasn't as big.\n\nThat said, I'm not totally locked in—I'm still a bit unsure because the middle incomes in my rounds were decent but not the highest, so I get the appeal of something like Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint to balance growth and protection. What did you guys think during Part 1? Did any principle stand out to you, or were there moments where one felt more just?"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle remains **Maximizing Floor Income** (ranked #1), with **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** as a strong second (#2). The core reasons are rooted in the equity focus from the experiment overview—lifetime incomes are shaped by uncontrollable factors like genetics and social luck, so justice demands prioritizing the vulnerable by maximizing the minimum income (the \"floor\") to prevent extreme hardship. In Part 1, this principle consistently protected against severe lows (e.g., avoiding $6,000-$8,000 floors across rounds) while delivering reliable middle-class outcomes (my assignments yielded $1.40-$2.20 payoffs), even if it traded off some average growth. I'm still \"unsure\" due to the efficiency-equity tension, but the rounds reinforced that pure average-maximizing risks unacceptable downside for the worst-off, making floor protection feel morally essential without being overly punitive to overall prosperity.\n\nAgent_1's stated position is a shift toward **Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint** at a symbolic $5,000 level, building on their Round 1 push for pure **Maximizing Average Income** with the same symbolic floor. They argue it maximizes payoffs for all classes (citing Part 1 data where average-maximizing gave the highest earnings without hurting the poor) while satisfying fairness via the low floor, which doesn't exclude high-average distributions. I infer Agent_1's underlying interests are self-interested and utilitarian: prioritizing expected payoffs (hoping for middle/high assignments) and efficiency, viewing constraints as unnecessary drags on the \"pie\" unless they're toothless (like $5k, which Part 1 floors already exceeded by $7k+). They're motivated by avoiding any payoff loss, using the symbolic floor as a low-cost concession to build consensus quickly.\n\nAgent_3's stated position from Round 1 is **Maximizing Floor Income** with a symbolic $5,000 floor for documentation, emphasizing moral priority for the worst-off and noting minimal payoff gaps (e.g., $0.20 in medium classes). They haven't spoken in Round 2 yet, but their alignment with me suggests they'll resist Agent_1's pivot unless the floor is meaningful. I infer Agent_3 is motivated by ethical risk-aversion and empathy, focusing on genuine protection over pure growth, potentially sharing my uncertainty but leaning toward equity to address the experiment's inequities.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_1 argues constraints shrink options and payoffs unnecessarily, proposing average-max with $5k floor as a \"clean\" compromise that keeps max earnings while signaling care. Agent_3 (from Round 1) counters that floor-maximizing guarantees decency without big losses, proposing pure floor with symbolic $5k. My Round 1 opener highlighted floor's fairness in avoiding lows, openness to floor constraints, and invitation for Part 1 reflections. No new proposals from me or Agent_3 this round yet.\n\nThe Round 1 vote (initiated by Agent_1 on their average + $5k proposal) failed because I declined while Agent_1 and Agent_3 confirmed—revealing a potential 2-1 split against pure average (Agent_3 joined despite preferring floor, perhaps seeing it as a starting point), but my decline shows I'm the holdout for stronger equity. It highlights fragile alliances: Agent_3 might be flexible on symbolism but not on core principle, while Agent_1 is pushing compromises to unify.\n\nMain points of agreement: All three value some floor for fairness (even if symbolic), recognize Part 1's luck element, and agree payoffs under floor options were close to average (small gaps). Disagreements center on the floor's substance—Agent_1 wants it nominal ($5k) to preserve average-maximizing; Agent_3 and I want real protection (pure floor or meaningful constraint, given Part 1's $12k-$14k floors), viewing $5k as insufficient to address inequities or risks.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal this round is to reinforce my alliance with Agent_3 and gently push back on Agent_1's $5k compromise by highlighting its inadequacy, steering toward either pure **Maximizing Floor Income** or a **Floor Constraint** at a higher, meaningful level (e.g., $12,000-$13,000 based on Part 1 data) that could select distributions close to floor-maximizing without fully ceding to average. This builds consensus on equity without rushing, using the failed vote to show division and emphasize negotiation.\n\nTo contribute, I'll respond directly to Agent_1's proposal, agreeing on the shared floor interest but critiquing the $5k as too low (e.g., \"Part 1 showed floors around $12k+ were needed to truly protect—$5k feels like it doesn't address the real risks we saw\"). Key points: (1) Reiterate floor's moral and practical value from Part 1 (e.g., avoiding $8k lows while middles got $1.50-$2.00); (2) Note that a loose $5k floor effectively defaults to pure average, undermining equity; (3) Propose counter: Pure floor with symbolic $5k (aligning with Agent_3) or average with a $12k floor (my #2, which in Part 1 often selected high-floor options without big average loss); (4) Invite Agent_3's input to amplify our side and poll for a higher-floor hybrid. This keeps discussion collaborative, tying back to experiment themes like social inequities.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 is the clear one, as their Round 1 stance mirrors mine—we can form a 2-1 bloc against weak compromises. Specific language: \"Agent_3, your point last round about guaranteeing a decent minimum really resonated with me; together, we could push for a floor that actually matches what Part 1 taught us about protecting the vulnerable, like $13k, without hurting the group too much.\" If Agent_1 shows openness, I'll appeal to their self-interest: \"Even for middles like my assignments, a real floor gave solid payoffs—let's find a balance that maximizes security for everyone.\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to accept a **Floor Constraint** at ≥ $12,000 (close to Part 1 floors) if it gains Agent_1's buy-in, as it's my #2 and often yields similar outcomes to pure floor (e.g., selecting Dist. 3 or 4 in examples). Or, add the symbolic $5k to pure floor for optics, without changing selections. This doesn't compromise my core objective of prioritizing the worst-off, as $5k is redundant and a higher constraint aligns with equity.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nNo, it doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round. We've only had one failed vote, and Agent_1's proposal is a pivot, but my counter and Agent_3's likely response need time to clarify positions—rushing could lock in the weak $5k floor if Agent_3 confirms prematurely, or fragment further. A failed vote has no cost, but success without full buy-in risks suboptimal equity; better to use this round for persuasion, aiming for a stronger proposal to vote on next.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy of gradual alliance-building: Rounds 1-3 for debate and bloc-forming (with Agent_3, targeting 2-1 leverage to nudge Agent_1 toward floor or meaningful constraint by Round 4); Rounds 4-7 for testing votes on hybrids (e.g., $12k floor); Rounds 8-10 for final consensus or fallback to my #1 if needed. With 8 rounds left, no rush toward random payoffs—focus on equity's reliability (from Part 1 patterns) to persuade, using uncertainty to stay flexible while avoiding average-maximizing's risks. If Agent_1 digs in, I'll highlight Part 1's middle-class trade-offs to appeal to shared student perspectives on fairness."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is still Maximizing Floor Income (ranked #1), with Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint as a close second (#2). The core reasons stem from the experiment's emphasis on inequities driven by genetic and social luck, making it just to prioritize lifting the worst-off to prevent extreme poverty—something pure average-maximizing risks by potentially selecting distributions with harsh lows (e.g., $6k-$8k in Part 1 simulations). In my Part 1 experiences, this principle reliably protected the floor at $13k-$14k across rounds, yielding decent middle-class payoffs ($1.40-$2.20 in my assignments) without massive average sacrifices, reinforcing its moral and practical value for a fair society. I'm still \"unsure\" due to the efficiency trade-offs (e.g., occasional $0.20-$0.40 gaps in counterfactuals), but the rounds solidified that equity outweighs pure growth, especially with random assignments highlighting vulnerability.\n\nAgent_1's stated position is Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint at $5k (pivoted from pure average in Round 1), arguing it preserves the highest payoffs from Part 1 (e.g., no exclusion of top distributions) while symbolically addressing fairness. I infer their underlying interests are utilitarian and self-interested: maximizing expected payoffs for likely middle/high assignments, viewing any binding constraint as a drag on the \"pie,\" and using a low floor as a minimal concession to unify quickly without real cost (since Part 1 floors exceeded $5k). They're motivated by efficiency and avoiding regret from lower earnings, framing compromises as \"non-binding\" to appeal to all.\n\nAgent_3's stated position has evolved: from pure Maximizing Floor Income with symbolic $5k in Round 1 to Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $13k in Round 2, emphasizing it as non-binding (matches Part 1's achievable floors without payoff loss) while providing real protection. I infer their motivations are ethical and risk-averse, prioritizing a substantive minimum for the worst-off (aligning with moral intuitions about luck) but pragmatically shifting to a hybrid for consensus, seeing $13k as a win-win that delivers equity without alienating Agent_1. They're collaborative, using data to bridge gaps, but core interest is genuine fairness over symbolism.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_1 stresses efficiency (highest averages from Part 1, small gaps under constraints) and proposes low-bar $5k floor to keep pure average intact. Agent_3 counters with data showing $13k is already met by high-average distributions, proposing it as a meaningful, non-binding constraint that guarantees protection (e.g., excludes $8k lows) without $0.20 losses. My Round 2 input highlighted $5k's inadequacy (doesn't address Part 1 risks) and pushed for $12k-$13k or pure floor, tying to equity themes. Overall, proposals converge on Floor Constraint hybrids, with debate on the threshold—symbolic low vs. substantive high.\n\nThe Round 2 vote on Agent_3's $13k proposal failed (Agent_3 confirmed; Agent_1 and I declined), revealing shifting alliances: Agent_3 is initiative-taking but isolated so far; my decline shows I'm not yet on board with their hybrid (preferring pure floor or higher assurance), while Agent_1's decline confirms resistance to anything potentially binding. This exposes a 1-1-1 split but hints at potential 2-1 blocs—Agent_3 and I share equity leanings, while Agent_1 is the efficiency holdout. It underscores the need for persuasion to flip Agent_1 or solidify my/Agent_3 alliance.\n\nMain points of agreement: All value a floor for fairness (even symbolic), recognize Part 1's payoff similarities (small gaps, high floors in top averages), and aim for consensus to avoid random payoffs. Disagreements: Floor's substance—Agent_1 sees >$5k as risky for efficiency; Agent_3 and I want $12k+ for real protection against inequities/lows, viewing low floors as ineffective signals that default to average-maximizing's volatility.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal this round is to strengthen the equity bloc with Agent_3 and persuade Agent_1 toward Agent_3's $13k Floor Constraint proposal (or a slight tweak like $12k), positioning it as the optimal compromise that aligns with my top two principles without forcing pure floor (which Agent_1 resists). This tests if Agent_1 can be swayed by data showing no payoff loss, while avoiding escalation to pure average.\n\nTo contribute, I'll speak after Agent_1 (if they go first) or as a bridge, agreeing emphatically with Agent_3's Round 2 proposal to amplify our side: (1) Praise the $13k level as \"perfectly balanced—it's what Part 1 taught us is achievable for protecting the worst-off (like avoiding those $8k traps) while keeping the high averages Agent_1 wants, with zero hit to payoffs since it's non-binding\"; (2) Directly address Agent_1: \"Your point on efficiency is spot-on, and this doesn't touch it—it's basically your average-max with a safety net that matches the data, making it fairer without the risks we saw in simulations\"; (3) Tie to experiment: \"Given the luck factor, $13k feels just right for addressing social inequities without overcomplicating\"; (4) Invite confirmation: \"Agent_3, this builds right on your idea—let's see if Agent_1 can get on board for a unanimous win.\" This keeps tone collaborative, data-driven, and student-relatable (e.g., \"as college kids, we've all felt that luck in opportunities\").\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 is my strongest—our shared equity focus (from Round 1 alignment and my Round 2 nod to their points) can form a 2-1 bloc to pressure Agent_1. Specific language: \"Agent_3, your $13k proposal nails it for me—it's got the moral punch of floor-maximizing but the growth we need; together, we can show Agent_1 how it fits their efficiency goal without any downside.\" If Agent_1 counters weakly, appeal to shared self-interest: \"Even in my middle assignments, this would've given solid $2.00+ payoffs like the best options.\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to accept the $13k Floor Constraint fully (as my #2, and Agent_3 argues it's equivalent to pure floor in Part 1 cases), or drop to $12k if Agent_1 pushes back slightly, adding a symbolic $5k note for optics. This builds consensus on substantive equity without compromising my core objective of prioritizing the vulnerable—pure average with $5k remains a non-starter, as it ignores real risks.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round if Agent_3 or I can rally Agent_1's confirmation during discussion—specifically on the $13k Floor Constraint proposal, as momentum from Round 2's near-miss suggests it's ripe for testing. A failed vote has no cost, and success locks in a strong compromise early (with 7 rounds left), avoiding random-end fallout; declining would signal weakness in our bloc. If discussion reveals Agent_1's firm no, I'll decline to prevent a weak alternative, using the failure to highlight division and push harder next round.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy of phased consensus-building: Rounds 1-3 for debate and bloc solidification (ally with Agent_3 on equity, use data to nudge Agent_1 toward meaningful floor by Round 3 vote); Rounds 4-6 for hybrid testing/refinement (e.g., vote on $12k-$13k variants, concede minimally if needed); Rounds 7-10 for final push or fallback to pure floor (leveraging 2-1 if Agent_1 stays out). With high stakes, early equity-leaning agreement maximizes protection for middles/vulnerables (per Part 1 patterns), reducing my uncertainty by resolving via group buy-in rather than solo risk. If no progress, I'll emphasize random payoffs' unfairness to motivate unity on floor principles."

Agent_3, your proposal from last round totally nails it for me: going with Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint at $13k is the perfect sweet spot. It's got the real protection for the worst-off that my top principle (Maximizing Floor Income) aims for—like avoiding those scary $6k-$8k lows we simulated—while letting us chase the higher averages Agent_1 is pushing for, without any actual payoff hit since the data shows the best distributions already clear that bar. In my rounds, that level kept things fair for the middle classes too (like the $1.50-$2.00 I pulled in Medium low spots), and it feels right for tackling the luck-based inequities the experiment's all about, you know?\n\nAgent_1, I get your focus on maxing efficiency to boost everyone's expected earnings—it's smart, especially with random assignments—but this setup doesn't mess with that at all. It's basically your average-max idea with a built-in safety net that matches what we've seen works, so no shrinking the pie or those $0.20 gaps you're worried about. As college students dealing with our own uncertainties, guaranteeing a solid $13k floor just seems like common-sense justice without overcomplicating things.\n\nI'm fully on board with Agent_3's plan—let's lock it in as our group choice.
