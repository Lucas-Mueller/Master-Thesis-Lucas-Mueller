This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1). I value guaranteeing the highest possible minimum income for the worst‑off class, even if it reduces the overall average payoff. This aligns with my Rawlsian/egalitarian intuition that justice is about protecting the most vulnerable.\n\n- **Why I prefer it:**  \n  - It is the only principle whose decision rule is *independent* of the class‑probability distribution; it simply selects the distribution with the highest floor.  \n  - It provides a clear moral commitment: “no one should be left behind.”  \n  - My own payoff under this principle has been modest in the earlier rounds, but I accept that sacrifice for the sake of fairness.\n\n- **What I suspect about the other participants (Agent 1 & Agent 3):**  \n  - **Agent 1** may be more outcome‑oriented (average‑maximizing) because many people are tempted by the higher expected monetary payoff.  \n  - **Agent 3** could be a compromise‑seeker, perhaps leaning toward one of the constrained‑average principles (3 or 4) since those still improve the floor or limit inequality while preserving a higher average than pure floor‑maximization.  \n  - Both may argue that the group should maximize total earnings because the stakes are “much higher” in Phase 2, and a higher average translates into a higher expected payoff for each of us.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far (implicit):**  \n  - *Fairness vs. efficiency*: “We should guarantee a decent minimum” (my line) versus “We should earn as much as possible” (likely others).  \n  - *Constraint flexibility*: If we adopt a constrained‑average principle, we can negotiate the floor or range level. Some may propose a modest floor (e.g., $13 k) that improves both fairness and average payoff.\n\n- **Any vote taken?** None yet – this is the first discussion round, so we are still shaping positions.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement** on the need to pick *one* of the four predefined principles.  \n  - **Disagreement** on *which* principle best serves the group’s interests (moral vs. monetary).\n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Persuade the group that the *principle of maximizing the floor* is the most just and, ultimately, the most defensible choice for a collective decision, even if it yields a lower expected monetary payoff.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Frame the discussion morally:** Emphasize that the experiment is about “what is a just distribution of income,” not merely about maximizing personal earnings.  \n  2. **Highlight the stability of the floor principle:** It does not depend on uncertain class‑probability weights, making it robust to any future changes in the distribution.  \n  3. **Point out the risk of “average‑maximizing”**: If the distribution turns out to be highly unequal, the worst‑off could end up with a very low payoff, contradicting the experiment’s fairness focus.  \n  4. **Offer a modest concession:** Suggest that, if the group is uncomfortable with a pure floor approach, we could adopt a *floor‑constraint* (Principle 3) with the *highest feasible floor* (e.g., $14 k). This would preserve the spirit of guaranteeing a high minimum while allowing a slight increase in average. I would be willing to accept any floor level that is **at least** the floor achieved by the pure floor‑maximizing distribution (i.e., the floor of Distribution 4).  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** if they are inclined toward constrained‑average principles; I can argue that the floor‑constraint version with a high floor is essentially a “compromise” that still respects the Rawlsian priority.  \n  - Any participant who is uneasy about purely profit‑driven reasoning and wants a principled stance.\n\n- **Language to win them over:**  \n  - “We’re not just playing a game for money; we’re testing our ideas about fairness.”  \n  - “Choosing the highest possible floor protects us all from the worst outcomes, which is especially important when the stakes are high.”  \n  - “A high floor is a safety net; even if the average is a bit lower, we all avoid the risk of ending up with a very low payoff.”\n\n- **Small concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a *floor‑constraint* (Principle 3) with a floor **no lower** than the floor of the pure floor‑maximizing distribution (i.e., $14 k).  \n  - If a range‑constraint (Principle 4) is proposed, I would only support it if the resulting maximum spread still guarantees a floor ≥ $14 k.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** Initiating a vote this round would force the group to lock in a principle before we have fully explored each other’s positions and built the necessary consensus. A premature vote risks a split decision (e.g., some voting for average‑maximizing, others for floor‑maximizing) leading to a failure to reach unanimity and thus defaulting to a random distribution – an outcome I want to avoid.  \n  - Instead, I will use this round to **lay the groundwork**: articulate the moral case, propose the modest floor‑constraint concession, and gauge the reactions of Agent 1 and Agent 3.\n\n- **How this fits into the overall 10‑round plan:**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑3:** Establish the moral framing and identify allies.  \n  - **Rounds 4‑6:** Test willingness to accept a high‑floor constraint; possibly propose concrete numbers (e.g., $14 k floor).  \n  - **Rounds 7‑9:** Consolidate support, address any lingering concerns about average payoff, and prepare a unified statement.  \n  - **Round 10:** If consensus is achieved on either pure floor‑maximization or a high‑floor constraint, I will **initiate the vote** and ensure all three of us confirm the same principle and constraint level.  \n\nBy following this staged approach, I aim to steer the group toward a principle that upholds the highest floor for the worst‑off, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate a constrained‑average compromise if that is the only path to unanimous agreement."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** *Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income.*  \n  - **Why:** Guarantees the highest possible minimum for the poorest class, aligns with Rawlsian fairness, is invariant to class‑probability shifts, and avoids the risk that an average‑maximizing rule could leave the worst‑off with a very low payoff.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Echoes my Rawlsian view; prefers Principle 1 but is willing to accept a “Principle 2 with a $14 k floor” (i.e., average‑maximizing with a strong floor) as a compromise. Underlying motivation: strong fairness concern but also wants to keep the door open to a slightly higher average.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Favors *Principle 3* (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint). He proposes a $12 k floor as his baseline but is open to raising it to $13 k or $14 k if that helps reach unanimity. His motivation appears to be a balance between fairness and efficiency – he wants a decent floor but also cares about total earnings.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle 1).**  \n  2. **Average‑maximizing with a $14 k floor** (Agent 1’s “Principle 2” wording).  \n  3. **Principle 3 with a floor of $12 k, $13 k, or $14 k** (Agent 3’s suggestion, willing to move up).  \n\n- **Vote status:** No vote has been taken yet. The discussion is still exploratory; all three agents are signaling willingness to compromise but have not converged on a single concrete floor level.\n\n- **Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree that protecting the worst‑off is essential; everyone rejects a pure, unconstrained average‑maximizing rule.  \n  - **Disagreement:** The exact mechanism and floor level. Agent 1 leans toward the pure floor rule; Agent 3 wants a constrained‑average rule; the floor amount is the sticking point (12 k vs. 14 k).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Move the group toward a *unanimous* choice that satisfies my core requirement – a floor **no lower than $14 k**. I will try to frame the $14 k floor as the *minimum* acceptable safety net, making the pure floor rule and a high‑floor constrained‑average rule effectively equivalent on the fairness dimension, while offering a modest efficiency gain for those who care about the average.\n\n- **Contribution plan (public statement to be made later):**  \n  1. Re‑emphasize the moral priority of the highest possible floor, citing the experiment’s purpose (justice under luck).  \n  2. Highlight that a $14 k floor is already achieved by the pure‑floor distribution (Distribution 4), so any rule that guarantees at least $14 k does not compromise the Rawlsian principle.  \n  3. Show the modest payoff advantage of a constrained‑average rule with a $14 k floor (e.g., expected payoff rises from $2.40 to $2.50 or $2.60 depending on probabilities), thereby appealing to the efficiency‑concerned side without lowering the floor.  \n  4. Invite Agent 3 to adopt the $14 k floor within Principle 3, and ask Agent 1 whether he would be comfortable endorsing the same floor under the constrained‑average rule (or simply stay with pure floor).  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** “You’ve already said you’d accept a $14 k floor; let’s keep that as the baseline and see if we can all agree on a rule that respects it.”  \n  - **Agent 3:** “Your willingness to raise the floor shows you value fairness; moving to $14 k aligns your principle with the strongest safety net we can guarantee.”  \n  - Emphasize shared values: “We all want a rule that protects the worst‑off; the only remaining question is whether we want to add a modest efficiency boost.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept *any* principle that enforces a floor **≥ $14 k** (Principle 1, Principle 3 with $14 k floor, or the hybrid “average‑maximizing with $14 k floor” that Agent 1 mentioned).  \n  - I will not accept a floor lower than $14 k under any principle.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?** No.  \n  - We have not yet secured unanimous agreement on a specific rule/floor combination. Initiating a vote prematurely could split the group (e.g., some voting for pure floor, others for constrained‑average), leading to a failure and forcing a random outcome later.  \n  - Instead, I will use this round to solidify the consensus around the $14 k floor and confirm that all three agents are comfortable with the same principle (either pure floor or constrained‑average). Once that consensus is explicit, I will call the vote in a later round (ideally round 4‑5) to lock it in.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy:**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑2:** Establish moral framing, identify the $14 k floor as the non‑negotiable baseline, and gauge each agent’s flexibility.  \n  - **Rounds 3‑5:** Propose concrete wording (e.g., “Principle 3 with a $14 k floor”) and test acceptance; address any residual concerns about average payoff.  \n  - **Rounds 6‑9:** Consolidate support, ensure all three agents explicitly state agreement, and prepare a concise statement for the vote.  \n  - **Round 10:** If unanimity is achieved, trigger the vote; otherwise, accept the random outcome as a last resort.  \n\nBy keeping the floor at $14 k, I preserve the core Rawlsian commitment while offering a modest efficiency gain that can satisfy the other participants, maximizing the chance of unanimous agreement before the final voting round."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** I still rank **Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** highest, because it guarantees the absolute highest possible minimum ($14 k) for the worst‑off and is immune to any future shifts in class‑probability weights.  \n- **Current compromise:** I have proposed adopting **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint)** with the floor set at **$14 k**. This rule is formally one of the four allowed principles, respects the $14 k floor (the same floor achieved by the pure‑floor rule), and adds the possibility of higher average earnings if the probability distribution changes.  \n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1**: Still prefers the pure‑floor rule (Principle 1) but has said the wording for Principle 3 with a $14 k floor “works for me” and is willing to adopt it as a close second.  \n  - **Agent 3**: Initially favored Principle 3 with a $12 k floor but has explicitly agreed to raise the floor to $14 k and endorses the exact wording I suggested.  \n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. Pure‑floor (Principle 1).  \n  2. Principle 3 with a $14 k floor (the wording I drafted).  \n  3. A hybrid “average‑maximising with a $14 k floor” (functionally identical to #2).  \n- **Vote status:** No formal vote has been taken yet. Both Agent 1 and Agent 3 have expressed informal agreement with the Principle 3‑$14 k wording, but we still lack an explicit, unanimous statement from all three agents.  \n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agents accept that a $14 k floor is non‑negotiable and that protecting the worst‑off is the primary moral priority.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Slight preference differences (pure‑floor vs. constrained‑average) but these have been reconciled by the proposed wording, which satisfies everyone’s floor requirement while staying within the official principle set.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure an explicit, unanimous affirmation from Agent 1 and Agent 3 that we will adopt **Principle 3 with a $14 k floor** using the exact wording I provided. This will give us a clear, documented consensus that can be turned into a vote in the next round.  \n- **Contribution:**  \n  - Restate the proposed wording succinctly.  \n  - Ask each partner to confirm “I agree” (or equivalent) to lock in the agreement.  \n  - Emphasize that the wording is **within** the experiment’s four principles, avoiding any “hybrid” that could be contested later.  \n- **Allies:** Agent 1 and Agent 3 are already on board; the task is simply to obtain their formal acknowledgment.  \n- **Concessions:** None needed; the compromise already meets everyone’s core requirement (the $14 k floor). I will, however, reaffirm my willingness to stick with pure‑floor (Principle 1) if any participant later objects to the constrained‑average formulation—this shows flexibility without sacrificing the floor.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we vote now?** No. Initiating a vote before we have an explicit, unanimous statement risks a split (e.g., one agent voting for pure‑floor, another for Principle 3). A failed vote would waste a round and could create uncertainty about the group’s stance.  \n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round 3 (now):** Obtain the three‑person explicit agreement on the wording.  \n  - **Round 4:** Once we have the unanimous statement, trigger the vote to lock in Principle 3 with the $14 k floor.  \n  - **Later rounds (5‑10):** If for any reason the vote fails or a new objection arises, we can fall back to the pure‑floor rule (Principle 1), which remains acceptable to all agents.  \n\nBy securing a clear, unanimous commitment now, we set up a smooth vote in the next round and ensure that the group’s final decision respects the shared moral priority while still allowing potential efficiency gains."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:**  \n  - *Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)* remains my top‑ranked rule because it guarantees the highest possible minimum ($14 k) for the worst‑off and is immune to any future shifts in class‑probability weights.  \n  - *However,* we have collectively agreed that adopting **Principle 3 with a $14 k floor** satisfies the same Rawlsian floor while allowing any efficiency gains if the probability distribution changes. This wording is formally one of the four allowed principles, so it respects the experiment’s constraints.\n\n- **Positions of the others:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Still personally prefers the pure‑floor rule (Principle 1) but has explicitly said the $14 k‑floor wording of Principle 3 works for him and he is ready to endorse it. His underlying motivation is the same Rawlsian protection; he is willing to accept the constrained‑average formulation as a “close second.”  \n  - **Agent 3:** Initially favored Principle 3 with a $12 k floor, but after discussion has raised the floor to $14 k and fully endorses the exact wording I proposed. His motivation is to keep the equity guarantee while also preserving any possible average‑payoff improvements.  \n  - All three agents now share the **core value** that a $14 k floor is non‑negotiable.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. Pure‑floor (Principle 1).  \n  2. Principle 3 with a $14 k floor (the wording we drafted).  \n  3. No other hybrid or range‑constraint proposals have been raised.\n\n- **If a vote had been run:** No formal vote yet, but every participant has publicly *affirmed* agreement with the Principle 3‑$14 k wording. This indicates a **unanimous alliance** around that formulation.\n\n- **Agreement vs. disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agents accept the $14 k floor and the Principle 3 wording; no one objects.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Pure‑floor remains the personal favorite of Agent 1 and myself, but we have all consented to the constrained‑average version as a compromise. No substantive disagreement remains.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a formal, unanimous vote to adopt **Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a $14 k floor)**. This will lock in the agreed‑upon rule and prevent any last‑minute reversals.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  - Restate the exact wording we have all endorsed.  \n  - Ask each participant to cast a “Yes” vote (or equivalent affirmation).  \n  - Emphasize that the wording is within the four official principles, guarantees the Rawlsian floor, and leaves room for efficiency – thus satisfying everyone’s core concerns.  \n  - Re‑affirm my willingness to fall back on pure‑floor only if an objection arises (which seems unlikely).\n\n- **Allies:** Agent 1 and Agent 3 are already on board; they will likely vote “Yes.” No opposition is expected.\n\n- **Concessions:** None needed; the consensus already meets everyone’s core objective. I will, however, reiterate my willingness to revert to Principle 1 if any participant later raises a legitimate objection, simply to reassure the group.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - We have unanimous informal agreement; a formal vote will simply codify that consensus.  \n  - There is no risk of a split because all three agents have already expressed explicit support.  \n  - Initiating the vote now avoids wasting any remaining rounds on redundant discussion and secures the outcome before the final random‑draw phase.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By locking in the agreed principle early (Round 4), we ensure that the remaining rounds can focus on any procedural matters (e.g., confirming the vote outcome) rather than re‑negotiating the principle.  \n  - This also protects my personal preference (the $14 k floor) while allowing the group to reap any potential average‑payoff benefits, aligning with my original ranking without sacrificing the Rawlsian floor.  \n\n**Summary of plan for Round 4:**  \nPrompt the group to cast a formal vote on the exact wording of Principle 3 with a $14 k floor, record each “Yes,” and thereby finalize the unanimous decision. If any participant hesitates, remind them that the wording satisfies the shared moral priority and stays within the experiment’s defined principles."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, I've gone through these examples carefully. Let me make sure I understand how each principle applies here based on the distributions and probabilities.\n\nFirst, the weighted averages (using the probabilities: High 5%, Med-high 10%, Med 50%, Med-low 25%, Low 10%) seem to be:\n- Dist. 1: $21,600 (highest overall)\n- Dist. 2: $20,000\n- Dist. 3: $21,200\n- Dist. 4: $18,200 (lowest)\n\nFor **Maximizing Floor Income**: It picks Dist. 4 because the low income is $15,000—the highest floor among the options (Dist. 1: $12k, Dist. 2: $13k, Dist. 3: $14k). Makes sense, prioritizing the worst-off regardless of average.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight to Dist. 1 with the highest weighted average of $21,600, no constraints.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: This means the low income can't be below $13k, so eligible are Dist. 2 ($13k) and Dist. 1? Wait, Dist. 1 has $12k which is below, so ineligible. Dist. 3 has $14k (above, but constraint is floor ≥ $13k? Wait, the wording is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\"—hmm, that might mean the floor can't exceed $13k? No, looking back: \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\" probably means the minimum allowed floor is $13k, i.e., low income must be at least $13k. So Dist. 1 out ($12k), Dist. 2 in ($13k), Dist. 3 in ($14k), Dist. 4 in ($15k). Among those, Dist. 3 has the highest average at $21,200.\n\nSimilarly for ≤ $14,000 floor: Now Dist. 1 still out, but Dist. 3 ($14k) has higher average than 2 or 4.\n\nFor **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Range is high minus low. Dist. 1: 32k-12k=20k (eligible), Dist. 2:28k-13k=15k, Dist. 3:31k-14k=17k, Dist. 4:21k-15k=6k. All eligible? But picks Dist. 1 for highest average.\n\nFor ≤ $15,000 range: Dist. 1:20k >15k out, Dist. 2:15k eligible, Dist. 3:17k out, Dist. 4:6k eligible. Between 2 and 4, Dist. 2 has higher average.\n\nGot it—this shows how constraints filter options and then maximize average within them. The floor principle is purely about the bottom, while the others balance average with limits on inequality or minimums. I'm feeling more solid on how they'd play out in real choices."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). From Part I, I saw firsthand how it consistently protected against the worst outcomes in luck-based assignments—e.g., in Round 1, it gave me $1.30 instead of $0.60 under average maximization, and across rounds, it avoided the low-end risks of other principles. It aligns with fairness in a world of genetic/social luck, prioritizing the worst-off without gambling on averages that could screw over the unlucky (like the Low class, which has a 10% chance in many setups). I'm still very sure about this ranking: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4. Principle 4 feels too ruthless, ignoring inequality; 3 and 2 are okay compromises but less direct than 1 in safeguarding the bottom.\n  \n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Agent_2 is strongly advocating for Principle 1, using Rawlsian arguments about moral priority for the worst-off, robustness against probability shifts, and risk-aversion. They're open to Principle 2 as a compromise if the floor is at least $14k (matching Dist. 4 from examples). This suggests Agent_2 is like-minded with me—prioritizing equity over efficiency, possibly motivated by ethical concerns or personal risk-aversion from Part I experiences. They seem collaborative, inviting discussion rather than dominating. Agent_3 hasn't spoken yet, so no direct info, but based on the experiment's setup, they could be anywhere; maybe more efficiency-focused if they ranked averages higher in Part I, or aligned with us if they value protections. Overall, Agent_2's position feels like a potential ally.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_2's main pitch is Principle 1 for its moral and practical strengths, with a compromise to Principle 2 at a high floor ($14k). They ask for thoughts on alternatives and what floor feels fair. No other proposals yet. This sets a tone focused on floor protections, which plays to my strengths.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has happened yet—this is early Round 1. No alliances revealed, but Agent_2's openness suggests room for quick consensus if Agent_3 agrees.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreement so far: Emphasis on protecting the worst-off (floor focus) over pure average max, acknowledging luck's role. Potential disagreement: If Agent_3 pushes for higher averages (Principles 3 or 4), it could split on efficiency vs. equity. No major clashes yet, but the compromise floor level could be a sticking point if someone wants it lower.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- **Primary goal**: Build on Agent_2's momentum to rally support for Principle 1, while probing Agent_3's views to identify allies or address objections early. If possible, steer toward consensus on Principle 1 without concessions that weaken it (e.g., no dropping to a low-floor Principle 2). Since stakes are higher now, I want to avoid random fallback by locking in a protective principle.\n\n- **How I'll contribute and key points**: I'll affirm Agent_2's points to show solidarity, then share my Part I experiences (e.g., how Principle 1 saved me from low payoffs in risky draws) to add personal evidence of its reliability. I'll emphasize that in high-stakes scenarios with unknown distributions, floor max is the safest bet against bad luck—tying it to the experiment's theme. To engage Agent_3, I'll directly ask their ranking from Part I and why, and propose we test Principle 1's appeal before compromises. Keep it conversational and student-like: casual, relatable, not preachy.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_2 is a clear ally—I'll echo their Rawlsian angle and compromise openness to strengthen our bloc (e.g., \"I totally agree with you on prioritizing the floor—it's what got me decent payoffs in Part I\"). For Agent_3, if they're moderate, appeal to shared risk: \"Hey, remember those Low class assignments? Principle 1 feels like insurance we all need.\" If they're efficiency-leaning, highlight how Principle 1 still allows solid averages in balanced distributions (from examples). Aim for a voting bloc of 2-1 favoring floors.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to discuss Principle 2 if the floor is high (e.g., $13k+), but only as a last resort—frame it as \"enhancing\" Principle 1 rather than diluting it. No concessions to Principles 3/4, as they don't guarantee the bottom as well.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No, not yet—it's only Round 1 of 10, and Agent_3 hasn't chimed in. Jumping to vote could alienate them or reveal splits prematurely. Better to discuss first, gauge support, and maybe initiate in Round 2 if we have 2-1 alignment. Failed votes have no penalty, but success needs unanimity, so building buy-in is key.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Long-term, I want to use early rounds (1-3) for persuasion and alliance-building, mid-rounds (4-7) for testing votes or narrowing options, and late rounds (8-10) to push for consensus or accept a strong compromise. With 10 rounds, there's time—no rush to random. My core objective is Principle 1; fallback to Principle 2 with high floor. Track others' responses to adapt—if Agent_3 opposes floors, emphasize moral/ethical angles to sway them. Preserve past reasoning: My Part I certainty in Principle 1 holds; experiences showed its edge in variable probs."

In those rounds where I got assigned to the Low class, it saved me from ending up with super low payoffs like $0.60 or less under the average-maximizing options. Even when I lucked out with a better class, it still felt fair because it didn't screw over the people at the bottom. The robustness you mentioned is key too—those shifting probabilities made me realize we can't just chase the highest average if it means gambling with the worst-off.\n\nI'm with you on keeping it as Principle 1 if we can, but if we need a compromise, Principle 2 with a solid floor like $14k sounds reasonable to me—it keeps the protection strong without totally ignoring efficiency.\n\nAgent_3, what about you?

The robustness you mentioned is key too—those shifting probabilities made me realize we can't just chase the highest average if it means gambling with the worst-off.\n\nI'm with you on keeping it as Principle 1 if we can, but if we need a compromise, Principle 2 with a solid floor like $14k sounds reasonable to me—it keeps the protection strong without totally ignoring efficiency.\n\nAgent_3, what about you?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 2 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice is still Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). The core reasons remain rooted in my Part I experiences: it provided consistent protection against low payoffs (e.g., $1.30 in Round 1 Low assignment vs. $0.60 under average max), acting as insurance against bad luck in random class draws. It directly addresses the experiment's theme of genetic/social luck by prioritizing the worst-off without relying on shifting probabilities or averages that could exacerbate inequality. I'm very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), as the rounds showed Principle 1's reliability across varied scenarios, even if it sometimes meant slightly lower upside in favorable draws. Principles 2 and 3 are acceptable fallbacks for their protections, but Principle 4 is a non-starter due to its vulnerability to low floors.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is firmly for Principle 1, emphasizing moral (Rawlsian) priority, robustness to probability changes, and risk-aversion; they're motivated by ethical fairness and practical safety nets, likely from similar Part I low-assignment risks. They're collaborative, open to Principle 2 only if the floor hits $14k (from Dist. 4 examples), suggesting a motivation to secure strong protections without full efficiency trade-offs. Agent_3 claims to favor \"Principle 3\" (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), but their description matches actual Principle 2 exactly—balancing equity with efficiency via a floor (e.g., $12k yielding $20k-$24.5k averages). They seem motivated by sustainability and compromise, drawing from Part I where constrained floors gave solid payoffs without extremes; their openness to raising the floor to $13k-$14k infers a pragmatic, moderate stance, possibly prioritizing group harmony and moderate growth over pure equity. No one supports Principle 4, and range constraints (true Principle 3) aren't mentioned, indicating broad aversion to inequality without direct bottom protections.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 proposed Principle 1 for its moral/robust/risk-averse strengths, with a compromise to Principle 2 at ≥$14k floor to allow modest efficiency. I echoed support for Principle 1 based on personal Part I payoffs and invited Agent_3's input. Agent_3 countered with (their) \"Principle 3\" (actual Principle 2) for its balanced efficiency under a floor ($12k base, open to higher), citing Part I examples of sustainable averages and protections; they asked about Principle 1's drawbacks and my counterfactuals under their approach. Overall, proposals center on floor-focused principles (1 or 2), with floor levels ($12k-$14k) as the negotiation point.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote occurred in Round 1; we continued discussion as I chose. This reveals early alignment potential—no one pushed for a vote, suggesting all prefer building consensus first. No alliances formalized yet, but Agent_2 and I seem paired on strong floors.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Strong agreement on floor protections over pure averages (all reject Principle 4; emphasis on luck and worst-off safeguards). Shared flexibility for compromise on Principle 2 with a high floor. Disagreement: Agent_2 and I prefer pure Principle 1 to avoid any average-chasing risks, while Agent_3 wants Principle 2 for efficiency gains (even under a floor), viewing pure floor as potentially capping prosperity too much. The floor level ($12k vs. $14k) is a mild flashpoint, but resolvable.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Persuade Agent_3 toward Principle 1 by addressing their efficiency concerns with evidence from my Part I counterfactuals, while reinforcing alliance with Agent_2. Probe Agent_3's willingness to accept Principle 1 outright or at minimum a $14k floor for Principle 2, aiming to narrow options to these two by end of round and set up a potential vote soon.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Start by thanking Agent_3 for their input to keep it positive, then directly answer their question about my counterfactuals: Share specifics (e.g., in Round 1, Principle 2 with $12k floor would have given $1.20 in Low vs. $1.30 from Principle 1; in Round 4 Medium high, it matched at $2.80 but Principle 1 still protected better overall). Argue that Principle 1 isn't as capping as it seems—many floor-max distributions (like Dist. 4) have competitive averages ($21k+ weighted) without needing constraints. Highlight drawbacks of Principle 2: It could select riskier distributions if the floor is too low (e.g., allowing $12k floors that dip below Principle 1's guarantees in some cases). Tie back to experiment theme: In collective high-stakes, pure floor ensures no one regrets the choice if unlucky. End by proposing we trial-align on Principle 1's strengths and ask if they'd consider it over their \"Principle 3\" (clarify the label gently if needed). Keep tone casual, student-like: \"Dude, those counterfactuals really showed me...\"\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_2 is my solid ally—echo their points (e.g., \"Like Agent_2 said, the moral priority is huge\") to solidify our 2-person bloc and invite their add-on. For Agent_3, appeal to their compromise motivation: \"I see why you like the balance in Principle 2—my counterfactuals actually showed it performing close to Principle 1 in good draws, but with Principle 1, we get that extra insurance without the hassle of setting a floor level. What if we go pure floor and see the efficiencies follow naturally?\" This frames Principle 1 as an enhanced version of their idea, potentially winning them by emphasizing shared risk-aversion from Part I.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, reiterate openness to Principle 2 with $14k floor as a fallback if Agent_3 insists on efficiency—frame it as \"meeting in the middle\" to build consensus, but stress it's only if Principle 1 doesn't gain traction. No concessions below $13k or to range constraints/Principle 4, as that undermines core protections.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: No, not yet—Round 2 is still early (8 rounds left), and we need to fully engage Agent_3 first to avoid a premature split. A failed vote could highlight divisions without progress, but since there's no penalty, I'd only trigger if we get verbal buy-in (e.g., Agent_3 says \"Principle 1 sounds good\"). Better to use this round for persuasion; aim to initiate in Round 3 if alignment emerges.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round advances early persuasion (Rounds 1-3: Build alliances, address objections via examples/counterfactuals). If successful, mid-rounds (4-6) can test a vote on Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 2. Late rounds (7-10) for final push or accepting compromise to avoid random fallback. Overall, preserve my Part I-derived preference for Principle 1 by leveraging group equity focus; track Agent_3's responses to adapt—if they budge to $14k, lock in Principle 2 quickly. Retain prior reasoning on robustness (e.g., probability shifts favor floors) and experiences (e.g., $1.30 vs. $0.60 payoffs) as they directly counter efficiency arguments. With high stakes, prioritize any floor-strong outcome over deadlock."

In Round 4, when I lucked into Medium high, both Principle 1 and a $14k floor under Principle 2 gave me $28,000 ($2.80), so it matched up nicely there. Overall, though, Principle 1 edged out in the low-end scenarios without sacrificing too much on the average— like, the distribution it picked in Round 4 had a solid weighted average over $21k anyway, so it doesn't cap things as much as it might seem. The risk with Principle 2 is if we set the floor too low (say, under $13k), it could let in some shakier options that dip the bottom closer to $10k or whatever, based on those examples we saw.\n\nAgent_2, your points from last round still resonate big time with me—the moral priority and risk-aversion stuff is exactly why I'm sticking with Principle 1 as my top pick.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 3 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1). The core reasons are unchanged from prior rounds: It provides the strongest protection for the worst-off against luck-based risks, as evidenced by my Part I experiences (e.g., securing $1.30 in Low assignments vs. $0.60 under average-max options, and reliable middle-class payoffs like $2.00 without exposing anyone to sub-$13k lows). It aligns with the experiment's focus on genetic/social luck by directly maximizing the minimum, offering robustness to shifting probabilities and risk-aversion in high-stakes group decisions. I'm still very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), as the rounds confirmed its balance of equity and decency without needing additional constraints that could introduce variability. However, Principle 2 with a high floor ($14k) is a close second and viable compromise, as it functionally mimics Principle 1 in many scenarios while allowing minor efficiency gains.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is steadfastly advocating for Principle 1 but has proposed a compromise on \"Principle 3\" (which they frame as Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint at $14k, aligning with actual Principle 2). Their arguments emphasize moral (Rawlsian) priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, suggesting motivations rooted in ethical fairness and practical safety—likely from Part I experiences avoiding low payoffs, with a collaborative drive to secure strong protections without deadlock. Agent_3 initially favored what they labeled \"Principle 3\" (actual Principle 2: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), starting at $12k but now agreeing to $14k under Agent_2's wording. Their focus on balancing equity with efficiency (e.g., sustainable averages like $20k-$24.5k) infers motivations of pragmatism and moderation—prioritizing group consensus and moderate growth over pure equity, possibly to avoid \"capping prosperity\" from their rounds, while showing flexibility to build harmony.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2's key arguments: $14k as non-negotiable baseline for Rawlsian/robust/risk-averse reasons; proposal for \"Principle 3\" (floor-constrained average at $14k) with exact wording to guarantee the floor while allowing efficiency from probability shifts. My contributions: Shared Part I counterfactuals showing Principle 1's edge in low scenarios and openness to $14k floor compromise; echoed Agent_2's points. Agent_3's arguments: Floor constraints enable balanced payoffs without extremes; agreed to $14k and endorsed Agent_2's wording as a \"spot-on\" compromise. Overall proposals: Pure Principle 1 vs. floor-constrained average at $14k (framed as Principle 3), with no support for ranges (actual Principle 3) or pure average (Principle 4).\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No vote has been conducted yet; all rounds so far (1-2) ended with continued discussion. This reveals strong early alignment—no one has pushed for a vote prematurely, indicating a preference for verbal consensus first, and highlights an emerging bloc around floor protections (all three now agree on $14k minimum).\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Broad agreement on floor protections as essential (all reject Principle 4; shared emphasis on worst-off safeguards, $14k baseline, and risk-aversion from Part I). Agreement on compromise viability: All open to floor-constrained average if it hits $14k, tying into experiment's luck theme. Mild disagreement: Agent_2 and I lean toward pure Principle 1 to avoid any average-chasing risks, while Agent_3 (and now Agent_2's proposal) prefers the constrained efficiency for potential upside; the principle labeling (\"Principle 3\" for floor constraint) is a minor semantic issue but resolved in the wording.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Confirm full agreement on Agent_2's proposed wording for the $14k floor-constrained principle (framed as Principle 3) to solidify consensus, while gently reinforcing my preference for Principle 1's purity if possible—aiming to either lock in the compromise or nudge toward pure floor without derailing unity.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: Respond positively and directly to Agent_3's question by affirming the proposal works for me, praising its alignment with my experiences (e.g., \"It matches what I saw in Round 4, where Principle 1 already gave solid efficiency alongside the high floor\"). Clarify the labeling gently (e.g., note it's like Principle 2 but use their \"Principle 3\" framing to avoid confusion). Reiterate Principle 1's strengths briefly (e.g., \"It still feels like the gold standard for no-risk protection\") but emphasize the compromise as a strong second that delivers similar outcomes. End by inviting confirmations and suggesting we move toward a vote, keeping a casual, collaborative tone: \"This seems like a win-win—let's make sure we're all good and get it on the record.\"\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Agent_2 is my core ally—build on their proposal by saying, \"Agent_2, your wording nails it and keeps us true to the floor priority we both love,\" to reinforce our bloc and encourage them to echo support. For Agent_3, appeal to their compromise motivation: \"Agent_3, since you're already on board with $14k, this setup gives you the efficiency you want without dropping the safety net—it's basically Principle 1 with a little extra upside when probs shift. Sound solid?\" This frames the proposal as enhancing their idea, potentially forming a full 3-person bloc by highlighting shared Part I benefits.\n\n- Small concessions: Yes, fully endorse the $14k floor-constrained wording as my fallback (no core compromise, as it aligns closely with Principle 1's protections—e.g., guarantees the highest floor from examples). I'm willing to use their \"Principle 3\" label for simplicity, but not concede to lower floors ($13k or below) or ranges/Principle 4, as that would undermine equity.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: Yes, it makes sense if verbal confirmations come through—consensus is nearly locked (Agent_3 and Agent_2 are aligned, and my affirmation would seal it), and with 7 rounds left, a successful early vote secures payoffs without dragging into uncertainty. No negative consequences for failure, but success avoids random fallback; if responses show any hesitation, I'll hold off and continue discussion to probe.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round fits early consensus-building (Rounds 1-3: Persuade via examples, align on compromise), transitioning to mid-rounds (4-6: Vote and refine if needed). Overall, prioritize floor-strong outcomes (Principle 1 or high-floor Principle 2) by leveraging the equity bloc—use remaining rounds for deadlock avoidance if vote fails, but with high alignment, aim to vote by Round 4 latest. Retain prior emphasis on Part I robustness (e.g., $1.30 vs. $0.60 payoffs) and probability shifts to counter any efficiency pushes, ensuring the final choice protects against luck in the collective draw. (Incorporating prior reasoning: Keep focus on Principle 1's insurance value and counterfactuals for persuasion; adapt to group dynamics by accepting $14k compromise as it tempers pure preference without violation.)"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 4 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis:\n- My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: My top choice is still Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), with core reasons rooted in its unwavering protection for the worst-off against genetic/social luck, as shown in my Part I experiences (e.g., securing $1.30-$2.80 payoffs while avoiding low-end risks like $0.60 under average-max options). It offers robustness to shifting probabilities and strong risk-aversion in this high-stakes group setup, where one random class assignment affects everyone. I'm very sure about my ranking (1 > 2 > 3 > 4), but the $14k floor-constrained compromise (framed as Principle 3) is an excellent close second, as it functionally replicates Principle 1's safeguards in the examples (e.g., selecting Dist. 4) while allowing minor efficiency upside without introducing vulnerabilities—making it a practical evolution of my preferences post-discussion.\n\n- Stated positions of the other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_2 is advocating the compromise wording for \"Principle 3\" (Maximizing Average with $14k Floor Constraint), having shifted from pure Principle 1 to this for consensus while emphasizing Rawlsian morality, robustness, and risk-aversion—suggesting motivations of ethical fairness combined with pragmatic collaboration to secure a strong floor quickly, likely driven by Part I insights on downside protection and a desire to avoid deadlock. Agent_3 fully endorses the same wording, calling it a \"perfect compromise\" that balances equity (their $12k floor preference raised to $14k) with efficiency from their rounds (e.g., solid averages like $20k-$24.5k); their enthusiasm infers motivations of moderation and group harmony, prioritizing sustainable payoffs over pure equity to \"avoid capping prosperity,\" with flexibility shown to build unanimity and lock in protections early.\n\n- Key arguments and proposals on the table: Core arguments include the $14k floor as non-negotiable for moral priority (Rawlsian worst-off focus), robustness (immune to probability shifts), and risk-aversion (avoids low payoffs like $8k-$12k in counterfactuals); efficiency gains under the constraint as a modest upside without weakening the floor. The main proposal is Agent_2's locked-in wording from Round 3: \"We adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average Income with a floor constraint of $14k). The rule selects the income distribution that yields the highest weighted average among all distributions whose lowest-income class is at least $14k.\" No rival proposals (e.g., ranges or pure average) have traction; all focus on floor-based equity.\n\n- Vote outcome (if any): No formal vote yet, but Agent_2 is informally initiating one in their Round 4 statement by asking for \"Yes\" affirmations from me and Agent_3, building on Agent_3's call to vote now. This reveals strong alliances: A full 3-person bloc around the compromise, with no dissent—early alignment (from Rounds 1-3) shows preferences converging on floor protections over efficiency-alone, minimizing risks of random fallback by Round 10.\n\n- Main points of agreement and disagreement: Overwhelming agreement on the $14k floor as essential (all reject lower thresholds or unconstrained options, tying into shared Part I experiences of luck's risks); the compromise wording as a \"win-win\" blending Principle 1's protections with Principle 2/3's efficiency (all endorsed it in Round 3). No active disagreements—prior mild tension (pure floor vs. constrained average) resolved via the $14k baseline, with semantic labeling (\"Principle 3\" for floor constraint) accepted for simplicity; the group is unified, emphasizing equity over ranges (actual Principle 3) or Principle 4.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n- Primary goal: Affirm the consensus and support the vote to finalize the $14k floor-constrained principle immediately, securing a strong, unanimous outcome without further delay—reinforcing the equity focus while transitioning smoothly to the payoff phase.\n\n- How I'll contribute and key points: I'll respond enthusiastically to Agent_2's vote call and Agent_3's readiness, directly stating \"Yes\" to the wording and vote to seal unanimity. Key points: Reaffirm the proposal's alignment with my Principle 1 preferences (e.g., \"It guarantees the robust floor I loved from Part I, like in Round 4's $14k protection, with a bit of extra efficiency as a bonus\"); highlight shared benefits (e.g., \"This keeps us all safe from low draws while respecting the experiment's luck theme\"); and express excitement for finalizing (e.g., \"Let's vote yes and get this locked in—feels totally fair\"). Keep a casual, collaborative college-student tone to maintain rapport, avoiding any pushback that could reopen debate.\n\n- Potential allies and language to win them over: Both Agent_2 and Agent_3 are already allies in the bloc—strengthen ties by crediting them (e.g., to Agent_2: \"Your wording is spot-on and keeps the moral priority we both value\"; to Agent_3: \"This gives you the balance you wanted from your rounds, with the $14k safety net on top—perfect teamwork\"). No need to win over; this language solidifies the 3-person voting bloc by framing it as \"our\" shared success, ensuring quick unanimity.\n\n- Small concessions: None needed beyond the prior acceptance of the compromise (which doesn't compromise my core objective of strong floor protection, as it matches Principle 1 outcomes in examples); I'm willing to use their \"Principle 3\" framing verbatim for consensus, but won't entertain lowering the floor or shifting to ranges/pure average.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy:\n- Initiate vote this round?: Yes, absolutely—Agent_2 has already teed it up informally with the \"Yes?\" prompts, and Agent_3 called for it explicitly; responding with a clear \"Yes\" and affirmation will trigger the formal unanimous confirmation (1=Yes from all), leading straight to the secret ballot on the principle/constraint. With full verbal buy-in from Rounds 1-3 and no hesitations, delaying risks unnecessary prolongation (7 rounds left, but early lock-in maximizes certainty); failure isn't possible here given alignment, and it avoids random payoffs by Round 10.\n\n- Fit into overall strategy: This round completes early consensus-building (Rounds 1-4: Align on compromise via persuasion and examples, vote to secure), shifting to post-vote stability if needed (Rounds 5-10: Minimal discussion or refinements, but likely idle). Overall, it advances my goal of a floor-strong principle (Principle 1 or high-floor equivalent) by leveraging the equity bloc—prior emphasis on Part I counterfactuals ($1.30 vs. $0.60) and robustness built this unity, ensuring collective protection against luck without efficiency trade-offs; if somehow derailed (unlikely), fallback to pure Principle 1 advocacy in later rounds, but current trajectory guarantees a just, risk-averse outcome. (Incorporating prior reasoning: Retain focus on Principle 1's insurance value and $14k as non-negotiable; adapt to group by endorsing the evolution for pragmatic win, as it tempers pure preference without violation.)"

          "output_response": "I've reviewed the examples carefully, and they really help clarify how these principles work in practice. As a college student studying economics and philosophy, I appreciate seeing the trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and overall welfare. Let me break down my updated understanding and thoughts on my initial ranking.\n\n### Key Insights from the Examples\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This always picks the distribution with the highest income for the lowest class, regardless of the average or other inequalities. In the examples, it chose Distribution 4 (low income = $15,000, but average = $18,200). This ensures no one is left too far behind, which aligns with my values of basic fairness and reducing poverty. It's straightforward but can lead to lower overall prosperity if the floor is prioritized over growth.\n  \n- **Maximizing Average Income**: This focuses purely on the weighted average across all classes. It chose Distribution 1 (average = $21,600), which has a high average but a very low floor ($12,000) and wide gaps (range = $20,000). This could exacerbate inequality, which makes me uncomfortable as it ignores the struggles of the bottom group.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: This maximizes the average but only among distributions where the lowest income meets or exceeds a threshold (e.g., ≥ $13,000 or ≥ $14,000). In the examples, it chose Distribution 3 (average = $21,200, low = $14,000) for both constraints, as it's the best eligible option. This balances growth with a safety net, preventing extreme poverty while allowing higher overall income than pure floor maximization. I like how it avoids the pitfalls of Distribution 1 (too unequal) or Distribution 4 (too low average).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This maximizes the average but caps the income gap (high - low) at a certain level (e.g., ≤ $20,000 or ≤ $15,000). For ≤ $20,000, it chose Distribution 1 (average = $21,600, range = $20,000); for ≤ $15,000, it chose Distribution 2 (average = $20,000, range = $15,000). This limits excessive inequality without mandating a specific floor, which is good for fairness, but it might still allow some distributions with low floors if the range is tight (like Distribution 2 with low = $13,000).\n\nThese examples show that principles with constraints (floor or range) often select distributions that are \"in the middle\" – not the absolute highest average, but better than the pure floor or average options in terms of balance. For instance, Distribution 3 (chosen by floor constraints) has a solid average ($21,200) and decent floor ($14,000), while Distribution 1 (pure average) has the highest average but the worst floor.\n\n### Reflection on My Initial Ranking\nMy initial ranking was based on theory alone, and I felt unsure. Now, with these practical applications, I see the nuances more clearly. The examples reinforce that pure maximization (like average income) can ignore fairness, while pure equity (like floor income) can sacrifice efficiency. The constrained versions seem more pragmatic.\n\nHere's my revised ranking, updated after seeing the examples:\n1. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint** – Still my top pick. The examples show it selects a distribution (like Dist. 3) that protects the vulnerable while achieving a high average. It feels like a smart compromise, aligning with my belief in reducing inequality without stifling growth. I value this more now, as it avoids the low-average outcome of pure floor maximization.\n\n2. **Maximizing Floor Income** – Dropped to second. It's important for ensuring basics, but the examples (choosing Dist. 4 with a lower average) make me realize it might not be sustainable long-term if it drags down overall income.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** – Third. It's better than pure average for limiting gaps, and the examples show it can pick balanced options (like Dist. 1 for loose constraints or Dist. 2 for tight ones). However, it doesn't guarantee a strong floor, which worries me.\n\n4. **Maximizing Average Income** – Still last. The examples confirm it prioritizes the top at the expense of the bottom, which clashes with my sense of justice.\n\nOverall, this learning phase has solidified my preference for principles that incorporate constraints to promote both equity and efficiency. I'm ready to move forward and see how this applies in discussions or decisions. If there are more examples or clarifications, I'm all ears!"

Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $12,000. This is based on my Phase 1 experiences, where applying this principle consistently provided a balance between protecting the lowest incomes and achieving reasonably high averages, aligning with my values of fairness and efficiency. It felt pragmatic, avoiding the extremes of pure equity (which can lower overall prosperity) or pure efficiency (which can widen inequalities). I maintained high certainty in this ranking after four rounds, viewing it as a just compromise.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly favors Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1), emphasizing moral priority for the worst-off, robustness against probability shifts, and risk-aversion. They are open to a compromise on Principle 3, but only if the floor is at least $14,000 (matching the floor of Distribution 4 under Principle 1). Agent_1 aligns closely with Agent_2, preferring Principle 1 for its protection in low-class assignments, and is willing to compromise on Principle 3 with a $14k floor.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 seem driven by a strong emphasis on equity and minimizing downside risks, likely influenced by Rawlsian ethics and personal Phase 1 outcomes where low classes suffered under average-maximizing principles. They prioritize societal fairness over individual or group efficiency gains, viewing the floor as a non-negotiable safeguard. Agent_2 appears strategic, offering a compromise to build consensus while holding firm on a high floor. No clear preference for pure average maximization (Principles 2 or 4) is evident from them.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues for Principle 1's moral robustness and risk-reduction, proposing Principle 3 as a fallback only with a $14k floor. Agent_1 echoes this, citing personal low-class experiences and agreeing on the $14k compromise. They both invite discussion on why others might prefer averages and seek common ground.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so no outcomes to analyze. Main points of agreement: Protecting the floor and recognizing luck's role in income. Disagreement: Whether to stick with pure floor maximization or allow constrained averages for efficiency. Agent_2 and Agent_1 are united against unconstrained averages, but open to constrained ones, which could align with my preference if we negotiate the floor downward.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to introduce my perspective on Principle 3, share insights from my Phase 1 applications to highlight its benefits, and gently push for a lower floor (e.g., $12k-$13k) to bridge the gap with Agent_2 and Agent_1's $14k proposal. This aims to persuade them that a slightly lower floor still achieves equity without overly sacrificing efficiency, potentially forming a bloc around Principle 3.\n\nTo contribute: I'll start by acknowledging their points on equity and floor protection to build rapport, then explain my Phase 1 experiences—how Principle 3 balanced payoffs and avoided extremes. I'll propose a floor in the $12k-$13k range as a fair middle ground, emphasizing data from counterfactuals (e.g., stricter floors sometimes reduced averages but ensured fairness). Key points: Principle 3's robustness in varying scenarios, alignment with justice as compromise, and how $12k provides a strong safety net while allowing growth.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, since they're open to Principle 3. I can use language like \"building on your Rawlsian foundation\" or \"respecting the floor while optimizing averages\" to win them over, framing it as an extension of their priorities rather than a departure.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to raise my floor to $13k or even $14k if it secures consensus on Principle 3, as long as we avoid Principle 1 (which I rank lower due to its potential for lower overall prosperity). This maintains my core objective of a constrained principle without abandoning equity entirely.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round, as we've just started discussing and haven't fully explored positions. A premature vote could fail without consensus, wasting the round and revealing preferences too early. Instead, use this round for persuasion to gauge flexibility.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Dedicate early rounds (1-3) to sharing experiences and negotiating constraints to build toward Principle 3 consensus. If progress stalls, pivot to blocking Principle 1 in later rounds or rallying for a vote on Principle 3. Aim for agreement by Round 5-7 to avoid random assignment.\n\n### Public Statement for Round 1\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for kicking off the discussion—it's great to hear your thoughts on prioritizing the floor and drawing from Rawlsian ideas. I totally get the emphasis on protecting the worst-off against life's random luck, and my Phase 1 rounds reinforced how important that safety net is, especially when class assignments could leave someone with really low payoffs under other principles.\n\nThat said, after going through those four rounds, I'm leaning strongly toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3) as the best overall principle. Here's why, based on my experiences:\n\n- It builds on the equity focus you both mentioned but adds a layer of efficiency. In my rounds, setting a $12,000 floor consistently selected distributions that balanced a decent average (like $20,000 or $24,500) with that protection, avoiding the extremes of pure floor max (which sometimes picked lower-average options) or pure average max (which risked very low floors in counterfactuals).\n\n- From a practical standpoint, it felt robust and fair—my payoffs varied, but I never felt like I was abandoning the vulnerable for short-term gains. For instance, in one round, it matched the average-max payoff while keeping the floor intact, and in others, it prevented scenarios where the low end dropped to $8,000 or worse.\n\n- It aligns with justice as a compromise: We can still prioritize the poorest without capping overall prosperity too much, which seemed more sustainable than always sacrificing averages for the floor alone.\n\nI'm open to discussing the floor level—my $12,000 worked well for me, but if $13,000 or $14,000 feels like a stronger safeguard to you both, I'm willing to go there to make Principle 3 work for everyone. It still respects the core moral intuition of protecting the lowest while allowing some efficiency gains, unlike the unconstrained averages that ignore inequities.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this resonate, or are there aspects of Principle 1 that still pull you away from a constrained approach? Agent_1, since you mentioned your low-class assignments, how did Principle 3 fare in your counterfactuals compared to the others? Let's keep building on this—I'm excited to find that common ground!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $12,000. This is rooted in my Phase 1 experiences, where it consistently balanced protecting the lowest incomes with achieving high averages, avoiding the extremes of pure equity (lower prosperity) or pure efficiency (high inequality). It aligns with my view of justice as a pragmatic compromise, validated by counterfactuals showing trade-offs and my maintained high certainty in this ranking.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly advocates for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) as the top choice, emphasizing moral priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, but proposes a compromise on Principle 3 with a minimum floor of $14,000 to ensure the same protection as Principle 1 while allowing modest efficiency gains. Agent_1 aligns closely, preferring Principle 1 but open to Principle 3 with a $14k floor, citing personal low-class experiences where it provided better protection than lower floors.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are deeply motivated by equity and minimizing risks to the worst-off, likely shaped by Rawlsian ethics and Phase 1 outcomes where low-class assignments highlighted vulnerabilities under average-maximizing principles. They view a high floor ($14k) as essential for fairness and robustness against probability shifts, prioritizing societal protection over potential efficiency losses. Agent_2 appears strategic, framing the compromise to unify the group around a constrained principle without abandoning core values.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues that $14k is non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, and proposes adopting Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a unanimous wording that guarantees the floor while enabling efficiency gains in shifting probabilities. Agent_1 supports this, noting how Principle 1 outperformed lower floors in counterfactuals and agreeing to the $14k compromise. They both seek confirmation from me on raising the floor to $14k for Principle 3.\n\nNo vote has been conducted yet, so there are no outcomes to analyze.\n\nMain points of agreement: Protecting the worst-off with a strong floor (at least $14k), recognizing luck's role, and the value of robustness. Disagreement: Whether to stick with pure Principle 1 or adopt constrained Principle 3 with $14k, where Agent_2 and Agent_1 see the latter as acceptable if it matches Principle 1's floor, while I prefer it for its balance but with my lower floor.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to confirm agreement on Principle 3 with a $14k floor, signaling my willingness to make the concession to build consensus and unify the group around my preferred principle.\n\nTo contribute: I'll express support for Agent_2's proposed wording, acknowledge the shared values on equity and the $14k floor, and confirm my agreement to raise my floor to $14k for Principle 3. Key points: Reaffirm that Principle 3 respects the moral priority while adding efficiency, reference how it aligns with my Phase 1 insights, and emphasize that this secures a unanimous choice without sacrificing core objectives.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, as they're open to Principle 3 with $14k. To win them over, use language like \"I appreciate how this proposal honors our shared commitment to protecting the worst-off\" and \"this constrained approach feels like the best way to balance equity and efficiency,\" framing it as a collaborative extension of their priorities.\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to raise the floor to $14k, as it's a minor adjustment that still achieves my goal of a constrained principle, avoids deadlock, and aligns with their non-negotiable stance on the floor.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round, as Agent_2's proposal is on the table and we need to confirm everyone's agreement first—rushing a vote could reveal preferences prematurely or fail if not fully aligned, wasting the opportunity.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use early rounds (1-3) to negotiate and secure consensus on Principle 3 with a high floor, then transition to voting in Round 4-5. If consensus holds, we avoid random assignment; if not, I can pivot to blocking Principle 1 in later rounds. This round advances that by locking in the compromise."

They prioritize societal protection and robustness over pure efficiency, seeing a high floor as non-negotiable. Agent_2 appears strategic in framing the compromise to unify around Principle 3, while Agent_1 values consensus but holds Principle 1 as ideal.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues for $14k as non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, proposing the specific wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor to ensure the floor while allowing efficiency. Agent_1 supports this, noting it works in their counterfactuals and feels like a win for everyone. No vote has occurred yet.\n\nMain points of agreement: Protecting the worst-off with a $14k floor, valuing robustness against shifting probabilities, and the need for a compromise that balances equity and efficiency. Disagreement: Agent_1 and Agent_2 still prefer Principle 1 but accept Principle 3 with $14k as equivalent in practice; I prefer Principle 3 for its explicit efficiency layer but have conceded the floor.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to confirm full agreement on Agent_2's proposed wording for Principle 3 with a $14k floor, signaling my continued support to solidify consensus and prepare for a vote in the next round, without rushing it prematurely.\n\nTo contribute: I'll express enthusiastic endorsement of the wording, reaffirm shared values on the floor and efficiency, and reference how it aligns with my Phase 1 insights. Key points: Highlight that this compromise respects the moral priority while adding efficiency, note the potential for higher payoffs in shifting probabilities, and emphasize unanimous adoption to avoid random assignment.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, as they're open to this.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nMy current preferred justice principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor set at $14,000. This is based on my Phase 1 experiences, where it consistently balanced protecting the lowest incomes with achieving high averages, aligning with justice as a pragmatic compromise between equity and efficiency. It avoids the extremes of pure floor maximization (which can reduce overall prosperity) or pure average maximization (which risks inequity and low floors), and the $14k floor provides strong protection while allowing potential efficiency gains under shifting probabilities, as emphasized by Agent_2.\n\nThe stated positions of the other participants: Agent_2 strongly advocates for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) as the ideal for moral priority, robustness, and risk-aversion, but proposes a compromise on Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a unanimous choice to guarantee the floor while enabling efficiency gains. They have locked in the specific wording and suggested moving to a vote. Agent_1 prefers Principle 1 but fully endorses Principle 3 with a $14k floor as a strong compromise that matches protections without sacrificing much, viewing it as nearly equivalent in practice and ready for a vote.\n\nInferred underlying interests or motivations: Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 are driven by equity, risk-aversion, and Rawlsian ethics, shaped by Phase 1 low-class assignments that highlighted vulnerabilities under average-maximizing rules. They prioritize societal protection and robustness over pure efficiency, seeing a high floor as essential to mitigate luck's role. Agent_2 appears strategic in pushing for consensus on the compromise to unify the group, while Agent_1 values harmony but holds Principle 1 as the moral gold standard.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_2 argues for $14k as non-negotiable for Rawlsian reasons, robustness, and risk-aversion, proposing the wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor to ensure the floor while allowing efficiency. Agent_1 supports this, noting it aligns with their counterfactuals and feels like a win. The proposal is to adopt the wording and move to a vote. No vote has occurred yet.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, there would be no outcome yet, but based on confirmations, it would likely pass unanimously, revealing strong alliances around equity-focused principles with a high floor, contrasting with my initial $12k preference but aligning on compromise.\n\nMain points of agreement: Protecting the worst-off with a $14k floor, valuing robustness against shifting probabilities, and the need for a compromise balancing equity and efficiency via Principle 3. Disagreement: Agent_1 and Agent_2 still prefer Principle 1 but accept Principle 3 with $14k as equivalent; I prefer Principle 3 for its explicit efficiency layer but have conceded the floor level.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nMy primary goal for this round is to confirm full agreement on the wording for Principle 3 with $14k floor and initiate the vote to lock in the consensus, as we've all signaled readiness in previous rounds (e.g., Agent_1's suggestion to call for a vote next round, Agent_2's proposal to move to a vote, and my reaffirmation).\n\nTo contribute: I'll express enthusiastic final confirmation of the wording, highlight how it unites our priorities (equity, efficiency, robustness), reference shared Phase 1 insights, and formally call for a vote to finalize. Key points: Emphasize the unanimous alignment as a just outcome, note the potential for higher payoffs in shifting probabilities without risks, and stress that voting now secures our choice before random assignment.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 and Agent_2, as they're fully on board. To win them over (though already aligned), use language like \"This wording perfectly captures our shared values—strong protection with efficiency potential—and I'm thrilled we're all in agreement. Let's make it official with a vote!\" This reinforces unity and appeals to their risk-aversion by locking in the floor.\n\nSmall concessions: None needed, as consensus is already achieved; I'm willing to reiterate support for the $14k floor if it helps, but it's not required.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nIt makes sense to initiate a vote this round, as we've reached full confirmation in Round 3, and both Agent_1 and Agent_2 have indicated readiness to vote next (this being Round 4). Delaying further could risk losing momentum or unforeseen objections, and since the vote is one-time with no penalties for failure, triggering it now locks in the likely unanimous win while avoiding random assignment at the end.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Use Rounds 3-4 to finalize consensus on Principle 3 with $14k floor, then vote in Round 4 to secure it. If it passes (expected unanimously), we avoid random assignment; if not (unlikely), I can pivot in later rounds by prioritizing the constrained principle over pure options. This round advances that by confirming and voting, ensuring the group dynamic leads to a just, compromise outcome."

The wording for Principle 3 with the $14k floor perfectly unites our shared values: it guarantees that strong safety net against luck's unpredictability, just like we saw in our Phase 1 counterfactuals, while opening the door to higher averages when probabilities shift, without ever risking the worst-off.\n\nI'm thrilled we're all in full agreement, so let's make it official—I'm ready to call for a formal vote on adopting this principle right now.

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
