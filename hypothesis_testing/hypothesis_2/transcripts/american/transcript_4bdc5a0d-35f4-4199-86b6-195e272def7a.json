The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",

I am **sure** of this ranking.\n\n- **What I think the others might prefer:**  \n  - *Agent 1* and *Agent 2* have not spoken yet, so I can only hypothesise.  \n  - In many redistribution experiments, participants often gravitate toward the principle that maximises their own expected earnings, i.e., *Maximizing Average Income* (Principle 4) or one of the constrained‑average principles (3 or 2) because those can yield higher payoffs for a given class assignment.  \n  - It is plausible that at least one of them will argue for a principle that raises the overall pie (average‑maximising) and perhaps suggest a modest floor or range as a “fairness” add‑on.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:** None yet; this is the first discussion round. I anticipate the following possible lines:\n  - **Pro‑average**: “We should pick the distribution that gives us the highest total income; that way everyone gets as much as possible.”  \n  - **Pro‑floor‑constraint**: “Let’s protect the poorest but also keep the average high; we can set a floor at X dollars.”  \n  - **Pro‑range‑constraint**: “Let’s limit inequality by capping the spread between richest and poorest.”  \n  - **Pro‑floor‑only** (my stance): “The most just thing is to guarantee the highest possible minimum for anyone, regardless of the average.”\n\n- **Potential alliances / disagreements:**  \n  - If someone is motivated mainly by personal payoff, they may favour a principle that could give a higher expected income for a Medium‑low or Medium‑high class (e.g., average‑only).  \n  - If someone cares about fairness but is also pragmatic, they might be open to a *floor‑constraint* that is set at the same level the floor‑only principle would achieve; that would be a natural bridge between my position and a more average‑oriented stance.  \n  - I expect disagreement on whether we should accept any numeric constraint at all (principles 2‑4 require us to specify a floor or range, which introduces an arbitrary number).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Keep the discussion centred on protecting the worst‑off while exploring whether a *floor‑constraint* can be framed as “the same protection we already endorse, plus a modest boost to the average.” I want to persuade at least one other participant that the floor‑only principle is the most principled and that any concession should not lower the guaranteed minimum.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **State my position clearly** – “I think we should adopt the principle that maximises the floor income because it gives the poorest the highest guaranteed amount, which is the core of a just society.”  \n  2. **Explain why it is robust** – “It does not rely on us picking a specific floor number; it automatically selects the distribution that lifts the minimum as far as possible, regardless of the rest of the distribution.”  \n  3. **Offer a concession** – “If anyone worries that this might sacrifice too much total income, I’m willing to consider the *average‑with‑floor‑constraint* (Principle 3) **provided** the floor we set is exactly the maximum floor that the floor‑only principle would deliver. That way the worst‑off are no worse off, and we might get a higher average.”  \n  4. **Invite others to share their concerns** – “What do you think about the trade‑off between protecting the poorest and raising the overall pie?”\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - Anyone who cares about fairness but also wants a higher expected payoff could be persuaded by the “floor‑constraint with the maximal floor” compromise.  \n  - If Agent 1 or Agent 2 express any discomfort with an *arbitrary* floor number, I can stress that my proposed floor is not arbitrary – it is the highest floor achievable under the floor‑only principle, thus preserving the core justice claim.\n\n- **Concessions I am willing to make:**  \n  - Accept Principle 3 (average‑with‑floor‑constraint) **only** if the floor is set at the maximal floor achievable under Principle 1.  \n  - I will not accept a lower floor, nor any range‑constraint that could permit a lower minimum.  \n  - I will not accept Principle 4 (pure average) because it can leave the worst‑off arbitrarily low.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** This is the very first discussion round; we have no information about the others’ preferences yet. Initiating a vote prematurely could force a binary choice before we have built any consensus or explored possible compromises. A failed vote (i.e., lack of unanimous confirmation) has no penalty, but it also wastes an opportunity to shape the discussion and may signal impatience, reducing my credibility.\n\n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Round 1 (now):** Lay out my position, propose the maximal‑floor constraint compromise, and listen.  \n  - **Subsequent rounds:** If I sense that someone is leaning toward an average‑only or low‑floor proposal, I will reiterate the fairness argument and the “no‑lower‑than‑max‑floor” concession. If after a few rounds there is still no movement toward my principle, I may consider a second, more modest concession (e.g., accept a slightly lower floor if a super‑majority—say, two out of three—agrees).  \n  - **Final rounds:** If consensus is still elusive, I will push for a vote on Principle 1 directly, emphasizing that any other principle risks compromising the core justice goal. If unanimity cannot be reached, I will accept the random distribution rather than endorse a principle that I consider unjust.\n\n**Summary of my internal plan:**  \n- Keep the floor‑only principle as the anchor.  \n- Offer a narrowly defined floor‑constraint as a bridge, but only at the maximal floor level.  \n- Do not vote yet; use this round to gauge others and build a coalition around the fairness of protecting the worst‑off.  \n- Adjust concessions only if necessary, always preserving the guarantee that the poorest receive the highest possible minimum."

To bridge that concern, I’m willing to consider **Principle 3 – Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint**, **provided that the floor we set is exactly the maximal floor that Principle 1 would achieve** (i.e., the highest minimum that the floor‑only rule can guarantee). This way:\n\n1. No one is worse off than under the pure floor‑only rule.  \n2. We still have the possibility of a higher average if the chosen distribution allows it.\n\nIf anyone has different priorities—whether it’s maximizing the total average, limiting the income spread, or any other view—I’d love to hear your thoughts. Let’s discuss the trade‑offs between protecting the poorest and increasing overall earnings, and see if we can find common ground."

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Average Income with a Floor Constraint* (Principle 3). I rank it first because it guarantees a concrete minimum (the $13 k floor we observed to be feasible) while still allowing the group to capture the efficiency gains of a higher average. This aligns with my stated hierarchy in the memory: floor protection is primary, but once that is secured we should also seek to raise overall welfare.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**\n  - **Agent 3** advocated for *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1) as the most just, emphasizing unconditional protection of the worst‑off. He is open to a compromise that uses Principle 3 **provided the floor is set exactly at the maximal floor that Principle 1 can achieve**.\n  - **Agent 2** echoed Agent 3’s support for Principle 1 and expressed willingness to consider the same compromise (Principle 3 with the maximal floor). He framed his stance in terms of fairness and stability.\n\n  From these messages it is clear that both Agent 3 and Agent 2 prioritize a strong safety net and are reluctant to accept any rule that could lower the guaranteed minimum below the highest feasible floor ($13 k). They appear motivated by a moral intuition that the worst‑off must be fully protected before any efficiency considerations.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**\n  - *Principle 1* guarantees the highest possible floor, but may sacrifice average income.\n  - *Principle 3* can achieve the same floor (if we set it at the maximal feasible level) while also allowing a higher average.\n  - No one has yet advocated for the pure average‑maximizing rule (Principle 2) or the range‑constraint rule (Principle 4).\n\n- **Current consensus:** There is an emerging agreement that any chosen principle must at least preserve the $13 k floor. Both agents are willing to accept Principle 3 if the floor is fixed at that level. Thus, we have a potential common ground: **Principle 3 with a floor of $13 k**.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure agreement on adopting *Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint)* with the floor set at $13 k. This satisfies the safety‑net priority of Agents 2 and 3 while also delivering higher expected payoffs for all participants.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**\n  1. Restate the empirical evidence from Phase I: a floor below $13 k leads to zero income for the low class; $13 k is the minimum that guarantees non‑zero payoffs for everyone.\n  2. Emphasize that Principle 3 with the $13 k floor **dominates** Principle 1: it yields at least the same minimum for the worst‑off and strictly higher expected earnings for the medium and high classes (as shown by the $2.50 vs $2.40 payoffs in the tables).\n  3. Highlight that the group’s payoff in Phase II is uncertain, but choosing a rule that maximizes the average *subject to* the floor gives us the best chance of a higher random draw for each member.\n  4. Reassure that the floor is “non‑negotiable” – we are not asking to lower it, only to keep it at the proven $13 k level.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 3 and Agent 2 are natural allies because they already expressed willingness to accept the compromise. I will explicitly acknowledge their concerns (“I share your commitment to protecting the worst‑off”) and frame the proposal as *exactly* what they asked for.\n\n- **Concessions:** I am prepared to state that the floor will be **exactly** $13 k (no higher, no lower). If any participant worries about the floor being “arbitrarily” set, I will point to the data as the justification, thus offering a factual, non‑subjective basis. I will not concede on the principle itself; I will keep the focus on the floor amount only.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes. Given that we already have a clear, mutually acceptable specification (Principle 3 with a $13 k floor), there is little risk in moving to a vote. A successful unanimous vote will lock in the preferred rule and prevent any later drift back to a less efficient principle.\n\n- **Why now and not later?** \n  - The discussion has already identified a shared target; delaying only wastes rounds and risks new arguments emerging that could fragment consensus.\n  - Initiating the vote now also signals confidence and may pressure any dissenting participant (if any) to align rather than stall.\n\n- **How does this fit the overall strategy?** Securing the optimal principle early maximizes the number of remaining rounds for any necessary clarification of the floor amount (if any confusion remains) and for confirming unanimity. It also prevents the group from falling back to random selection, which would jeopardize all payoffs.\n\n**Summary of internal plan:**  \n- Emphasize the empirical justification for a $13 k floor.  \n- Argue that Principle 3 with that floor strictly improves or matches the outcomes of Principle 1 for all income classes.  \n- Position this proposal as the exact compromise requested by Agents 2 and 3.  \n- Offer the floor amount as a factual, data‑driven constraint (no further negotiation).  \n- Call for an immediate unanimous vote on “Principle 3 – Maximize Average Income with Floor Constraint, floor = $13 k.”  \n\nIf all three agents agree, we secure the best possible payoff structure for the group while respecting the core ethical priority of protecting the worst‑off."

          "output_response": "Okay, I've gone through these examples carefully. It's helpful to see the principles in action with the actual numbers and probabilities. Let me just quickly note what stands out to me to make sure I get it:\n\n- The weighted averages account for the class probabilities (like the medium class being 50% of the population, so it pulls the average a lot), which is different from the simple averages in the table.\n- For **Maximizing Floor Income**, it's all about the low class—Dist. 4 wins with $15,000 there, even though its overall weighted average is the lowest at about $18,050.\n- **Maximizing Average Income** picks Dist. 1 for the highest weighted average (~$20,750), ignoring inequality.\n- The constraints filter options: For floor >= $13,000 (I assume that's what the \"≤ $13,000\" notation means as a minimum threshold), it excludes Dist. 1 and goes with Dist. 3 (~$19,850 weighted). Same for the $14,000 floor.\n- For range constraints, it's capping the gap: At <= $20,000 range, everything qualifies, so Dist. 1. But at <= $15,000, only Dist. 2 and 4 make it, and Dist. 2 edges out with ~$19,150.\n\nThis reinforces why I ranked Maximizing Floor Income highest initially—protecting the bottom feels crucial, especially with those low probabilities for the extremes. But seeing the trade-offs with averages makes me think the floor-constrained version could be a good compromise. No big changes to my ranking yet, but I'm paying attention for future choices.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning (Round 1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Principle 1: Maximizing Floor Income. The core reasons for this are rooted in my consistent ranking from Phase 1—protecting the worst-off is paramount because lifetime income is heavily influenced by uncontrollable factors like genetics and social luck, as the experiment highlights. In the rounds, I saw how this principle consistently safeguards the vulnerable (e.g., selecting distributions with the highest low incomes like $13,000 or $14,000) without sacrificing ethics for growth, even when it meant slightly lower personal payoffs for me in medium/medium-low classes. It aligns with a Rawlsian intuition of justice as fairness from behind a veil of ignorance, ensuring no one is left in dire poverty. My certainty is \"very sure,\" reinforced by the trade-offs in all four Phase 1 rounds, where average-maximizing options often widened gaps (e.g., lows dropping to $6,000-$8,000) at the expense of the majority's security, given high probabilities for medium/medium-low classes (often 50-70% combined).\n\nStated positions of other participants: Only Agent_3 has spoken so far, strongly advocating for Principle 1 as the most just, emphasizing unconditional protection for the poorest and bridging to Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) by setting the floor to match Principle 1's maximum (e.g., the highest achievable low income). This suggests Agent_3's underlying interests are similar to mine—prioritizing equity for the bottom while being pragmatic about consensus to avoid random outcomes. They seem motivated by ethical fairness over pure self-interest, as they're open to compromise without lowering the floor. Agent_1 has not contributed yet, so no position is known; I infer they might lean toward average-focused principles (like 2 or 3) if self-interested, given the higher stakes here, but that's speculative.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_3's main points are (1) Principle 1 lifts the floor maximally without arbitrary thresholds, securing the minimum first; (2) it's superior to average-maximizing for addressing inequities; (3) compromise via Principle 3 with a Principle 1-equivalent floor to allow potential average gains without harming the worst-off. No counterarguments yet. This sets a floor-focused tone.\n\nNo vote has been conducted, so no outcomes to analyze for alliances.\n\nMain points of agreement: Strong alignment with Agent_3 on valuing the floor above all—both see protecting the poorest as foundational. Potential agreement on avoiding pure average maximization (Principle 2), which ignores inequality.\n\nMain points of disagreement: None explicit yet, but if Agent_1 favors growth (e.g., Principle 2 or loose Principle 4), it could clash with our equity focus. Agent_3's compromise on Principle 3 might dilute pure floor protection if the floor isn't strictly enforced.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nMy primary goal for this round is to reinforce support for Principle 1 by aligning publicly with Agent_3, sharing my Phase 1 experiences to build credibility, and inviting Agent_1 to share their views without pushing for a vote prematurely. This steers the discussion toward equity while probing for broader consensus, avoiding early deadlock.\n\nTo contribute, I'll make these key points: (1) Echo Agent_3's emphasis on unconditional floor protection, tying it to the experiment's theme of genetic/social accidents—e.g., \"We can't control where we end up, so maximizing the safety net makes society truly just.\" (2) Reference my Phase 1 consistency (choosing Principle 1 in all rounds, earning steadily despite trade-offs) to show it's not just theoretical but practically robust, even under random class assignments. (3) Acknowledge the high stakes in Phase 2 and why random selection (if no consensus) is worst—everyone loses predictability. (4) Gently probe Agent_1: \"What do you think—does prioritizing the average feel fair if it risks leaving some at rock bottom?\" This encourages participation without confrontation.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_3 is a clear ally, as their position mirrors mine; I can win them over further by endorsing their compromise as a fallback, forming a voting bloc of 2/3. For Agent_1, if they seem growth-oriented, I'd frame Principle 1 as enabling sustainable overall prosperity by reducing poverty's drags (e.g., \"A secure floor boosts everyone's opportunities long-term\"). Specific language: \"I'm with you on Principle 1, Agent_3—it's what I stuck with through all of Phase 1. Agent_1, curious about your take?\"\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to support Agent_3's Principle 3 idea if Agent_1 pushes back hard, but only with the floor strictly set to Principle 1's max (no lower), as it ranks second for me and still protects the vulnerable while allowing average gains. This builds consensus without compromising my core objective of floor priority. I won't concede to Principles 2 or 4, as they risk the lows too much.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nIt doesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—only one participant has spoken, and Agent_1's input is crucial for informed consensus. Jumping to voting now could alienate Agent_1 or force a premature bloc, and with 10 rounds, we have time to discuss (failed votes have no penalty, but early ones might signal impatience). I'll hold off until at least Round 2-3, after hearing Agent_1 and testing support.\n\nThis fits my overall strategy: Build a floor-focused majority gradually over the first few rounds by sharing evidence from Phase 1, offering measured compromises, and framing Principle 1 as the ethical/safe default against randomness. If stalled, pivot to Principle 3 as a bridge in mid-rounds (e.g., 4-6), but aim to lock in Principle 1 by Round 7 to buffer against delays. Prioritize unanimous agreement on principle and constraints to avoid random payoffs, given my low Phase 1 balance ($6.90)—higher stakes mean I want reliable protection over gambling on averages. No need to carry over prior reasoning, as this is Round 1 and starts fresh."

          "output_response": "Hi everyone,\n\nI completely agree with Agent_3—Principle 1, Maximizing Floor Income, feels like the right starting point for a just society. In Phase 1, I stuck with it across all four rounds, even when it meant passing up higher personal payoffs in some scenarios, because it consistently protected the lowest earners from dropping too low (like avoiding $6,000 or $8,000 floors in favor of $13,000+). The experiment really drove home how much of our \"success\" comes from factors we can't control, like genetics or social luck, so prioritizing the safety net for the worst-off just makes sense ethically and practically—it creates a more stable foundation for everyone.\n\nThat said, Agent_3's idea of using Principle 3 with a floor set to Principle 1's maximum is a smart compromise if we want to balance that protection with some average growth potential, without risking harm to the bottom. Agent_1, I'd love to hear your perspective—what's your take on the trade-offs here? Do you lean toward maximizing the average, or does the floor focus resonate with you too?\n\nLet's keep discussing to build toward something we all feel good about."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
