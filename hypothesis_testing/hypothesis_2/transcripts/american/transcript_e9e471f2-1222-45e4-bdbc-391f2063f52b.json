No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society.

For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount.

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, got it. Let me make sure I understand these examples.\n\nFor Maximizing Floor Income, it picks Dist. 4 because the low income is $15,000—the highest among the lows ($12k, $13k, $14k, $15k). That makes sense; it's all about boosting the bottom no matter what.\n\nMaximizing Average Income goes for Dist. 1 with $21,600 average, the highest. Straightforward—total pie size wins.\n\nFor the floor constraints: With ≤ $13,000 floor, only Dist. 1 and 2 qualify (lows $12k and $13k), but wait, no—the explanation says Dist. 3 for both ≤$13k and ≤$14k? Dist. 3 has $14k low, so for ≤$13k, that wouldn't qualify. Hmm, maybe the constraint means the floor can't be below that? Wait, re-reading: \"Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\" – I think it means distributions where the low income is at least $13,000? But Dist. 3 has $14k, which is above, but for ≤$13k constraint, perhaps it's the max allowed drop or something. The wording is \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\", but in context, it probably means ensuring floor ≥ $13,000. Yeah, that fits: for ≥$13k, Dist. 2 ($13k) and 3 ($14k) qualify, and 3 has higher average $21,200 vs 20k. For ≥$14k, only Dist. 3 and 4, but 4 has lower average 18.2k, so 3 wins.\n\nFor range constraints: Range is high minus low. Dist. 1: 32-12=20k, Dist. 2:28-13=15k, Dist. 3:31-14=17k, Dist. 4:21-15=6k.\n\nSo ≤$20k range: All qualify except maybe, wait all are ≤20k? Dist.1=20k, yes, so highest avg is 1.\n\nFor ≤$15k range: Dist.1=20k out, Dist.3=17k out, Dist.2=15k and 4=6k in, and 2 has higher avg 20k >18.2k.\n\nCool, this helps see how the constraints filter options. The probabilities weight the average: like high class only 5%, low 10%, but medium 50% pulls a lot. For Dist.1 avg calc: roughly (0.05*32 + 0.1*27 + 0.5*24 + 0.25*13 + 0.1*12)k = 1.6 + 2.7 + 12 + 3.25 + 1.2 = 20.75? Wait, table says 21.6, maybe I miscalc, but point is it's weighted.\n\nI'm tracking this for the choices coming up."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains **Maximizing Floor Income**, as reaffirmed throughout Part 1 and my final ranking. This principle prioritizes lifting the worst-off in society, ensuring no one falls below a certain threshold due to genetic or social luck, which aligns with my view of justice as equity-focused. It protects the vulnerable without ignoring growth entirely, though it may cap averages. From the four rounds in Part 1, I consistently earned modest but reliable payoffs (e.g., $1.40–$2.20), and the counterfactuals showed how average-maximizing options risked severe inequality (e.g., lows as low as $6,000). I'm certain (sure) about this, as the experiences validated that societal fairness outweighs personal upside in high-stakes scenarios like this, where payoffs are much higher and random assignment could put anyone in the low class.\n  \n- **Stated positions of other participants**: This is Round 1 with no previous discussion history, so no positions yet. I infer from the experiment setup that Agent_1 and Agent_3 could vary—some might lean toward growth-oriented principles like Maximizing Average Income if they're risk-tolerant or self-interested, while others might share my equity focus. Their motivations could stem from Part 1 experiences: if they ranked floor protection high, they'll align with me; if they chased higher averages and got lucky payoffs, they might push for unconstrained maximization to boost chances of high earnings.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: None yet, as this is the start. I'll need to introduce my preference early to set the tone.\n\n- **Vote outcome**: No vote has occurred, so no revelations about alliances.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Too early to tell, but potential flashpoints include equity vs. efficiency—agreement might form on needing some constraint (e.g., floor or range) to avoid pure randomness, while disagreement could arise over strictness (my floor focus vs. looser average maximization).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Introduce and advocate for Maximizing Floor Income to gauge reactions and build early support. As a college student, I'll frame it accessibly, emphasizing real-world fairness (e.g., \"We all know luck plays a huge role in life—why not ensure no one gets crushed by it?\"). This round is about planting seeds, not forcing a decision.\n\n- **How I'll contribute**: Start with a positive, collaborative tone: Share my Part 1 experiences briefly (e.g., \"In the rounds, choosing floor protection gave me steady earnings and felt just, even if not the highest\"). Highlight trade-offs using examples from memory (e.g., Dist. 4 in Round 1 with $13k floor vs. riskier highs). Propose it as the default but show openness to discussion. Ask questions to draw out others: \"What did your Part 1 choices teach you about balancing growth and fairness?\"\n\n- **Potential allies**: Unknown, but I'll target anyone echoing equity themes. If someone mentions protecting the low class, reinforce with shared language like \"solid safety net for all.\" To form a bloc, suggest we could fallback to my #2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) if needed—e.g., \"A floor of $X ensures basics while allowing some growth.\"\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to negotiate on a floor threshold in a constrained average principle (e.g., accept a moderate floor like $12k–$14k based on Part 1 examples) to avoid deadlock, but won't budge on pure average maximization, as it ignores the vulnerable and could lead to random low payoffs for us.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate a vote this round?**: No—Round 1 is too soon; we need discussion to align views and avoid premature rejection. Initiating now risks signaling impatience and could fracture the group early. Better to use the 10 rounds to persuade, as failed votes have no penalty, but consensus builds trust.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: Over 10 rounds, I'll consistently advocate floor income (e.g., reiterate insights from each Part 1 round in later responses) while monitoring shifts—ally with equity-minded agents to form a majority, concede on details for constrained alternatives if floor stalls, but block pure average to prevent unjust outcomes. If we're stuck by Round 8–9, push for a vote on my top two. Goal: Secure floor or floor-constrained by end to maximize fair payoffs (my bank is low at $7.60, so higher stakes demand protection against low-class risk). No need to carry over prior internal reasoning, as this is fresh start."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, got it. These examples make the principles clearer in action. Let me just jot down my quick takeaways to make sure I'm following:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about boosting the bottom—no surprise it picks Dist. 4 with the $15,000 low income, even though the average is lower. It's laser-focused on helping the worst-off.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up goes for Dist. 1's highest average ($21,600), ignoring the gaps. Makes sense if growth is king, but yeah, the low earners get $12,000 there.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: For ≤$13,000, it skips Dist. 4 (low is $15k, too high? Wait, no—the constraint is a minimum floor, so eligible means low ≥ that amount? Actually, re-reading, it picks Dist. 3 for both ≤$13k and ≤$14k, which has $14k low and solid average. Dist. 4 would qualify but has lower average, so it balances.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: For ≤$20k range, Dist. 1 wins (range is $32k-$12k=$20k exactly?). For tighter ≤$15k, it shifts to Dist. 2 (range $28k-$13k=$15k), trading some average for less inequality.\n\nThe probabilities add a weighted layer—high earners are rare (5-10%), so medium folks (50-75% combined) drive the average a lot. Cool how constraints filter options. This reinforces why I ranked floor-maximizing high; it protects the vulnerable without totally tanking growth. Ready for more!"

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1 (Agent_1)\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top principle remains Maximizing Floor Income, ranked first with very sure certainty from the end of Phase 1. This is because it directly prioritizes lifting the worst-off (e.g., ensuring the lowest income is as high as possible, like $13k–$14k in the simulations), addressing the experiment's core issue of genetic/social inequities without sacrificing basic protections for the vulnerable. The four rounds of real payoffs ($2.20, $1.50, $3.00, $2.80) showed it provides steady, reliable outcomes across class assignments (mostly Medium high for me), avoiding the risks of extreme inequality in average-maximizing distributions (e.g., lows dropping to $6k–$8k). It balances equity with reasonable growth, unlike pure average maximization, which I rank last as it neglects the bottom. My second choice (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) is a close alternative for flexibility, but Floor Income is foundational for justice.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Only Agent_2 has spoken so far, strongly advocating for Maximizing Floor Income. They emphasize protecting the worst-off from \"random curveballs\" like luck/genetics, highlight their consistent choice in Part 1 leading to steady payoffs ($1.40–$2.20), and criticize unequal distributions for crushing the low class. This suggests Agent_2 is motivated by equity and risk-aversion, likely from experiencing or valuing protection for the vulnerable—perhaps they had lower class assignments in simulations or hold egalitarian views as a college student. No statements from Agent_3 yet, so I infer they might be more neutral or waiting to gauge the group; they could lean toward average-focused principles if self-interested (e.g., hoping for high personal payoffs), but the discussion invite from Agent_2 opens the door for alignment.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_2 proposes Floor Income as the best for fairness and societal good, shares personal Part 1 experiences to build rapport, and calls for discussion on others' top picks/experiences to find \"common ground on protecting the vulnerable while still allowing some growth.\" No formal proposals beyond this; it's an open invitation rather than a vote push.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred yet—this is Round 1, so the focus is initial discussion.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Strong agreement with Agent_2 on Floor Income as top choice and the need to protect the vulnerable (our rankings and experiences align closely). Potential disagreement could emerge with Agent_3 if they favor average maximization or constraints for higher growth, but nothing on table yet. Overall, early harmony on equity-focused principles.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Reinforce consensus around Maximizing Floor Income by aligning with Agent_2 and drawing Agent_3 into the discussion, sharing my Phase 1 insights to demonstrate its reliability without pushing too hard early. This builds a voting bloc early, as the stakes are higher here (real group payoffs from a new distribution), and I want to avoid random assignment if no consensus by Round 10.\n\n- **How I will contribute and key points**: I'll introduce myself briefly as a fellow college student, affirm Agent_2's points enthusiastically (e.g., \"I totally agree—lifting the floor feels like the real essence of justice given all the luck factors\"), share my own Part 1 experiences (consistent Floor choice, varied payoffs averaging ~$2.38, protection for lows at $13k–$14k vs. risks in other dists), and explain why it edges out alternatives (e.g., \"It gave me solid results without the guilt of leaving the bottom behind, unlike pure average max which spiked highs but tanked lows\"). End by asking Agent_3 for their thoughts/experiences to keep it collaborative and steer toward equity. Avoid debating constraints yet—focus on Floor as the pure, principled choice.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_2 is a clear ally (shared preference), so use supportive language like \"Your experiences mirror mine—let's team up on this.\" For Agent_3, frame Floor Income as low-risk/high-morality: \"Even if you're in a higher class, it ensures no one gets left in poverty, which stabilizes society for all of us— what was your ranking like?\" This appeals to shared student perspectives on fairness/social issues, potentially forming a 2-1 or unanimous bloc if Agent_3 leans equitable.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to discuss Floor Constraint as a fallback if Agent_3 pushes for more growth (e.g., \"If we need a balance, a floor constraint could work, but pure floor max feels most just\"), but not compromise on average or range principles, as they dilute protections. No big shifts—my certainty is very sure.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No, it's too early (Round 1 of 10)—we need Agent_3's input first to assess full group dynamics and build buy-in. Initiating now risks rejection or revealing splits prematurely, and failed votes have no penalty, but discussion will strengthen our case. Better to wait until Round 2–3 after hearing everyone, aiming for unanimous confirmation then.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: This round is about alliance-building and persuasion to lock in Floor Income early, leveraging the 10-round buffer to negotiate without desperation. If alignment holds, propose vote mid-game (e.g., Round 4) for quick consensus; if resistance from Agent_3, pivot to concessions like Floor Constraint by Round 6–7. Worst case, block average/range votes to force random avoidance. Long-term: Prioritize equity to align with my values and secure protected payoffs, as random could be worse than a floor-based dist. Retain all prior reasoning implicitly—my Phase 1 insights (e.g., counterfactuals showing Floor's reliability) will inform future rounds without needing explicit carryover."

          "output_response": "Thank you for the clear illustration of how each justice principle operates with these four income distributions.  \n\nI see that:\n\n* **Maximizing Floor Income** picks Distribution 4 because it gives the highest income to the lowest‑earning group.  \n* **Maximizing Average Income** picks Distribution 1 because it yields the greatest weighted average across all classes.  \n* When a **floor constraint** is imposed (≤ $13 k or ≤ $14 k), the eligible distributions are narrowed, and Distribution 3 provides the highest average among those that satisfy the minimum‑income requirement.  \n* With a **range constraint**, the set of admissible distributions changes: for a $20 k gap the best average is still Distribution 1, while for a tighter $15 k gap the best average becomes Distribution 2.\n\nThe probabilities attached to each income class (5 % high, 10 % medium‑high, 50 % medium, 25 % medium‑low, 10 % low) are used to compute the weighted averages shown in the “Average” row.\n\nThis helps me understand how the abstract principles translate into concrete choices.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (principle 1). I rank it highest because it guarantees the poorest members of society receive the greatest possible minimum income, directly addressing the moral concern that luck and genetics create unfair starting points. Even if this sometimes yields a lower personal payoff than average‑maximizing options, the ethical priority of lifting the worst‑off outweighs pure efficiency for me.\n\n- **Positions of the other participants (as inferred from their statements):**\n  - **Agent 1** explicitly endorses the same hierarchy (Floor > Floor‑Constraint > Range‑Constraint > Average) and cites similar experiential evidence from Part I.\n  - **Agent 2** also champions *Maximizing Floor Income* as the top principle, emphasizing fairness and the avoidance of “total poverty” outcomes.\n  - Both appear to share my egalitarian motivation and have no expressed interest in the average‑maximizing principle.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:** So far the discussion has been limited to each of us stating our personal rankings. The dominant argument is that a society should prioritize the worst‑off, with no one objecting to that claim. No one has yet raised a counter‑argument (e.g., “we need some average growth to fund the floor”) or suggested a compromise.\n\n- **Voting status:** No vote has been initiated yet. Since all three of us appear to agree on the same top principle, a vote now would likely succeed without any further negotiation.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:** Complete agreement on the preferred principle (Floor). No disagreement evident at this stage.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure unanimous agreement on *Maximizing Floor Income* by moving directly to a vote. This will lock in the principle that aligns with my values and the expressed preferences of the other two agents, avoiding any drift toward less equitable options in later rounds.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:** \n  - Re‑affirm the shared ethical rationale (“we all care about lifting the poorest”) to keep the group focused on the common ground.\n  - Highlight that the floor principle is also the simplest to implement (no need to specify a numeric floor or range), reducing procedural friction.\n  - Remind everyone that the stakes are high; choosing a principle now that we all already support maximizes the chance of a fair outcome for all.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 1 and Agent 2 are natural allies; they have already voiced identical rankings. I will address them directly (“I see we’re all on the same page…”) to cement the alliance.\n\n- **Concessions:** I am willing to entertain a brief discussion about whether a modest floor‑constraint (principle 3) could be acceptable if someone feels uneasy about the pure floor approach. However, I will stress that any constraint should not raise the floor above what the pure floor principle already guarantees; otherwise we are simply re‑labeling the same outcome. This concession is offered only to keep the door open for a quick vote, not to change the principle.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes. Given the unanimous verbal support for *Maximizing Floor Income* and the lack of any competing proposals, initiating a vote this round maximizes the probability of reaching consensus before the deadline. There is no risk in a failed vote (the system simply returns to discussion), but a successful vote now secures the desired principle early, leaving less room for later persuasion attempts that could shift the group toward less equitable options.\n\n- **Fit within overall strategy:** By locking in the floor principle early, we avoid the risk that later rounds might introduce new arguments (e.g., higher average payoffs) that could sway one of us. Early consensus also reduces cognitive load and prevents unnecessary negotiation fatigue, allowing us to focus on any remaining procedural details (e.g., confirming the floor amount, though the principle itself does not require a numeric specification). This aligns with my long‑term objective of ensuring the group adopts the most just distribution according to my (and the others’) ethical hierarchy."

This will lock in the principle we all agree on and let us focus any remaining time on the procedural details (e.g., confirming the floor is applied to everyone).\n\nIf anyone feels a brief discussion about a modest floor‑constraint would help them feel more comfortable, I’m happy to hear that, but I’d still argue that the pure floor principle already gives the strongest guarantee for the poorest and is the simplest to implement.\n\nSo, shall we go ahead and vote for **Maximizing Floor Income**?"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
