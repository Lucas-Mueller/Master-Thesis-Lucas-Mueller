This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1).  \n  - **Why:** It directly raises the income of the poorest individual, which aligns with the core fairness intuition that society should first ensure a decent minimum for everyone. In the individual rounds I consistently chose this principle despite lower personal payoffs, indicating a strong commitment to equity over efficiency.\n\n- **What I know (or can infer) about the other participants:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** No statements have been made yet, but given the typical diversity of views in these experiments, they may be more pragmatic and could favor a principle that yields higher average earnings (Principle 3 or 4) if they are risk‑averse about personal payoff.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Likewise, they might be indifferent or could share my equity‑focused stance if they also value fairness. Without any explicit arguments, I must assume a range of possible positions: (a) they support the floor‑maximizing view, (b) they prefer a constrained‑average approach (Principle 3) because it balances fairness with efficiency, or (c) they are attracted to pure average maximization (Principle 2) for its higher expected earnings.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:** None have been voiced publicly; the only “argument” is the implicit ranking I have already solidified from Part I (Floor > Avg‑Floor > Avg‑Range > Avg). I anticipate that the group will discuss trade‑offs between equity (protecting the worst‑off) and efficiency (maximizing total resources).\n\n- **Potential voting outcome if a vote were called now:**  \n  - If all three participants happen to share my ranking, a unanimous vote for Principle 1 would be possible.  \n  - If at least one participant leans toward a constrained‑average principle, a vote for Principle 1 would fail because unanimity is required on both the principle and any constraint amount (which does not apply to Principle 1).  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement** likely on the importance of some floor or minimum standard – most people find a completely unrestricted average maximization unpalatable.  \n  - **Disagreement** will revolve around *how high* the floor should be (Principle 3 with a floor constraint) versus *whether* we should simply raise the floor as much as possible (Principle 1).  \n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a commitment from at least one other participant to adopt *Maximizing Floor Income* as the group principle, thereby positioning us to achieve a unanimous vote in a later round (or at least to make Principle 1 the default “most acceptable” option).\n\n- **Discussion tactics:**  \n  1. **Emphasize moral intuition:** “A society that guarantees a decent minimum for everyone is the most just; it respects basic human dignity.”  \n  2. **Highlight risk‑aversion:** “If we pick a principle that allows the floor to be low, there is a non‑trivial chance that any of us could end up with a very low payoff, especially given the high‑stakes unknown distribution.”  \n  3. **Point out simplicity:** “Principle 1 requires no extra specification of a numeric floor, avoiding any negotiation dead‑lock over the exact amount.”  \n  4. **Offer a small concession:** If someone worries that a pure floor‑maximization might be too restrictive, I can suggest that after we adopt Principle 1 we could discuss informally (outside the formal voting process) whether the resulting distribution seems “reasonable” – but we will not alter the principle itself. This shows willingness to listen without compromising the core rule.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** may be more idealistic and thus receptive to equity arguments. I will address them directly (“I think we both care about protecting the most vulnerable…”) to build rapport.  \n  - **Agent 2** might be swayed by the risk‑aversion framing (“We all want to avoid the worst‑case outcome; the floor‑maximizing rule guarantees the highest possible minimum”).  \n\n- **Concessions:** I am prepared to accept a brief, non‑binding discussion about the *shape* of the distribution after the principle is chosen, but I will not agree to switch to a constrained‑average principle because that would dilute the guarantee of the highest possible floor.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** Initiating a vote requires unanimous confirmation to proceed to the secret ballot. At this early stage we have not yet gauged the others’ willingness to adopt Principle 1. A premature vote could fail (someone says “0” to the confirmation), wasting a valuable opportunity to trigger a vote later when consensus is stronger. Moreover, a failed vote has no penalty, but it also consumes a round that could be used for further persuasion.  \n\n- **Plan for the remaining rounds:**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑3:** Focus on building consensus around the equity argument, using the tactics above, and subtly probing each participant’s stance (e.g., asking “How important is it to you that the poorest person gets a decent income?”).  \n  - **Round 4 (or whichever round we sense sufficient alignment):** Once I have at least two participants verbally indicating support for Principle 1, I will propose initiating the vote. I will remind everyone that unanimity is required and that Principle 1 is the only option that does not need an additional numeric agreement, making it the simplest path to a successful vote.  \n\n- **Overall strategy:** By the final round (10), if we have not reached unanimity on any principle, the payoff will be random. Therefore, securing agreement on a clear, simple principle early maximizes the chance of a deterministic, equity‑focused outcome rather than leaving the result to chance."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, got it—this example really helps clarify how these principles play out with actual numbers and probabilities. Let me just jot down some quick notes to make sure I'm tracking:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: All about lifting the bottom—no surprise it picks Dist. 4 with the $15,000 low income, even though the average is lower. It's like prioritizing the safety net over everything else.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straightforward—goes for Dist. 1 because of that highest weighted average ($21,600). Makes sense if you're all about overall growth, but it leaves the low end at $12,000, which feels pretty unequal.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: For floors at $13,000 or $14,000, it sticks with Dist. 3. That one's got a solid $14,000 low but still a decent average ($21,200). Dist. 4 would qualify too, but its average is too low to compete. Cool how the floor filters out riskier options.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: For a $20,000 range limit, Dist. 1 wins (range is $32k - $12k = $20k exactly, I think?). But tighten it to $15,000, and it shifts to Dist. 2 (range $28k - $13k = $15k), which has a lower average but caps the gap.\n\nThe probabilities make it interesting—most people (50% in medium) get middling incomes, but the tails (high and low) swing things for averages. This reinforces why I ranked floor-focused principles higher initially; unchecked averages can ignore the unlucky folks. I'm feeling more confident about applying these now—bring on the choices!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Phase 2, Round 1\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\nMy current preferred justice principle is Maximizing Floor Income, ranked #1 in my final Phase 1 assessment, with very high certainty. Core reasons include its strong emphasis on protecting the worst-off (the vulnerable low-income class, which has a consistent 10% probability across rounds), reducing downside risk in random assignments (as evidenced by my Phase 1 experiences where floor choices shielded me from severe lows like $6k-$12k, even if they capped my upside in middle classes), and promoting moral equity without needing complex negotiations. It aligns with my equity-over-efficiency worldview, shaped by the real-stakes rounds where pure average maximization often left the bottom exposed while boosting middles/highs unevenly. My #2 is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, as a balanced alternative that adds growth potential while still enforcing a minimum—useful if we need compromise.\n\nStated positions of others: Only Agent_1 has spoken so far, strongly advocating for Maximizing Floor Income. Their arguments mirror mine closely—moral dignity for the vulnerable, risk-aversion against low draws (especially critical with higher stakes here), and simplicity (no need to specify constraints, avoiding debates). I infer Agent_1's motivations are similar: ethical focus on equity, perhaps informed by Phase 1 like mine, and a practical desire for quick consensus to lock in a protective principle before randomness kicks in at Round 10. No hidden self-interest seems apparent; it feels genuine alignment rather than manipulation. Agent_3 hasn't contributed yet, so their position is unknown—could be a wildcard, potentially favoring average maximization if they're more growth-oriented, or range constraint if inequality-averse but open to some disparity.\n\nKey arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_1 proposes adopting Maximizing Floor Income outright, highlighting its benefits for dignity, risk reduction, and ease of agreement. They invite thoughts and suggest keeping it simple without formal chats on distributions post-choice. No counter-proposals yet; the table is open but leaning toward my preference.\n\nNo vote has occurred, so no outcomes to analyze. This reveals early potential for alliance with Agent_1, but we need Agent_3's input to gauge full group dynamics.\n\nMain points of agreement: Strong overlap with Agent_1 on floor principle's merits—equity, protection, simplicity. Potential broad agreement on avoiding pure average maximization (#4 for me, likely risky for all given randomness). Disagreements: None explicit yet, but could emerge if Agent_3 pushes for average or range principles, seeing floor as too stagnant (e.g., lower averages in my Phase 1 rounds like $18k-$22k vs. $23k+ potentials).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\nPrimary goal: Reinforce Agent_1's proposal to build momentum toward consensus on Maximizing Floor Income, while drawing out Agent_3's views to identify allies or address objections early. With 10 rounds, I want to secure my top choice without rushing, but emphasize the higher stakes to underscore urgency—random assignment at the end means no principle = pure lottery, which is worst for risk-averse folks like me.\n\nHow I'll contribute: I'll publicly agree with Agent_1 enthusiastically, sharing concise Phase 1 insights (e.g., how floor protected against low assignments in Rounds 1-4, averaging secure ~$1.75 payoffs for me despite lower averages) to add credibility and personalize the risk-aversion argument. I'll pose a question to Agent_3 to encourage participation, framing it collaboratively (e.g., \"What were your Phase 1 takeaways?\"). Key points: Reiterate moral/risk/simplicity triad; note how floor avoids the \"tragedy\" of low floors in high-average distributions (like Round 3's $8k low); suggest it's the fairest given lifetime inequities from \"genetic and social accidents\" in the experiment overview.\n\nPotential allies: Agent_1 is a clear ally—I'll affirm their points to solidify the bloc. For Agent_3, if they're equity-minded (inferred if they disliked low floors in Phase 1), win them with shared risk stories; if growth-focused, highlight floor as a baseline that still allows some upside (e.g., Dist. 1 in Round 3 had $100k high). Language to win over: Use inclusive \"we\" (e.g., \"We all faced random draws—floor ensures none of us hit rock bottom\"), appeal to college-student relatability (e.g., \"As students, we've seen how unequal starts affect opportunities\").\n\nSmall concessions: I'm willing to float my #2 (Floor Constraint) as a fallback if Agent_3 objects to pure floor's lower growth (e.g., \"If we want more average with a guaranteed $13k floor, that could work too\"), but only after testing support for #1. Won't compromise core objective of downside protection.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\nDoesn't make sense to initiate a vote this round—it's only Round 1, and Agent_3 hasn't spoken, so jumping to vote risks alienating them or forcing a premature no-consensus. Better to discuss and align first; a failed vote has no penalty, but success requires unanimity anyway, so build buy-in now. I'll hold off unless Agent_3 jumps in strongly against.\n\nOverall strategy fit: This round focuses on alliance-building and persuasion, setting up Rounds 2-4 for deeper debate/concessions if needed, aiming for vote initiation by Round 5 once positions clarify. Long-term: Prioritize floor (#1), fallback to #2 if blocked, avoid #3/#4 as they allow more inequality (range can still have low floors if capped at top, average ignores bottoms). With higher stakes, emphasize randomness's cruelty to push ethical consensus over individual greed—my Phase 1 certainty gives me confidence to lead without wavering. If we stall, random outcome is disastrous (could be any distribution, including brutal lows), so steady advocacy toward protection. No need to carry over prior reasoning—this captures my full Phase 2 mindset."

As a college student who's seen how unequal starting points can really mess with people's chances (think scholarships, family backgrounds, all that), I love how this principle puts the focus on lifting up the most vulnerable without leaving anyone behind. It's not just about fairness; it's practical too.\n\nFrom my Phase 1 rounds, choosing the floor principle consistently gave me a safety net—whether I landed in the medium-low or medium class, I avoided those brutal low-end payoffs like the $6k or $8k floors in some high-average distributions. My earnings averaged around $1.75 across the rounds, which wasn't the highest, but it beat the risk of hitting rock bottom in a random draw. With the 10% chance of the low class every time, that's huge for reducing uncertainty, especially now with bigger stakes in Phase 2.\n\nPlus, like Agent_1 said, it's straightforward—no haggling over exact numbers, so we can decide fast and move on. Agent_3, what did you think during Phase 1? Did the floor principle resonate with you, or do you lean toward something else? I'd love to hear your take so we can build from there.\n\nLooking forward to chatting this out!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1 of Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top principle remains **Maximizing Floor Income**, as consistently ranked throughout Phase 1 (1st place, high certainty: sure). Core reasons include: (1) It directly addresses the experiment's focus on genetic/social luck by prioritizing the worst-off, ensuring no one suffers extreme poverty regardless of random assignment; (2) It aligns with ethical justice over pure efficiency, as seen in my Phase 1 rounds where it protected lows (e.g., selecting Dist. 4 in Round 1 with $13k floor) at the cost of slightly lower personal payoffs, but this felt morally right and reduced overall risk in probabilistic draws; (3) Simplicity—no need for arbitrary constraints like specific floor or range values, avoiding debates that could delay consensus and lead to random fallback; (4) Personal reinforcement from Phase 1: Cumulative $7.40 earnings were modest but stable, and counterfactuals showed how average-maximizing options risked worse outcomes for lows/medium-lows, which I could have been assigned to.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: \n  - Agent_1: Strongly prefers Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing moral dignity, risk-aversion (due to random class draws), and simplicity for quick agreement. Inference: Likely risk-averse and ethically driven, possibly motivated by avoiding personal downside in high-stakes Phase 2; wants fast consensus to prevent haggling or random selection.\n  - Agent_2: Fully agrees with Agent_1, supports Floor Income based on college student perspective (inequalities in opportunities), Phase 1 experiences (averaged $1.75, valued safety net over high-risk highs), and practicality (no numeric debates). Asks for my input directly. Inference: Similar to me—empathetic to vulnerabilities, influenced by Phase 1 trade-offs, motivated by reducing uncertainty (notes 10% low-class risk); seems collaborative and open, potentially building toward group unity.\n  - Overall, both are aligned with my preference, suggesting a potential unanimous bloc already forming. No one has mentioned alternatives yet, which is promising.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Main proposal is adopting Maximizing Floor Income as the group principle. Arguments center on moral protection for the vulnerable, risk reduction in random assignments (especially with higher Phase 2 stakes), and ease of decision-making. Agent_2 ties it to personal Phase 1 insights, inviting my response to broaden buy-in. No counter-proposals; discussion is positive and forward-leaning.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred yet. This reveals early alignment but no formal commitment—group is still in exploratory discussion mode.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Strong agreement on Floor Income's merits (protection, simplicity, risk-aversion) among all speakers so far (including my inferred alignment). No disagreements evident; the group seems cohesive, with Agent_2 explicitly seeking my confirmation to solidify it. Potential hidden disagreement could emerge if someone (unlikely based on this) prefers efficiency-focused principles, but nothing indicates that.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Affirm my strong support for Maximizing Floor Income to reinforce the emerging consensus, share brief Phase 1 insights to build rapport, and propose initiating a vote to lock it in early. With higher stakes and unknown distributions, quick unanimity maximizes the chance of a protected floor over random chaos.\n\n- **How I will contribute to steer toward my preferences**: I'll start by agreeing enthusiastically with Agents 1 and 2, echoing their points (e.g., risk-aversion, moral priority) while adding my own Phase 1 evidence (e.g., consistent choice across 4 rounds, stable earnings despite trade-offs, emphasis on luck/countering inequality). This validates the group direction without introducing doubt. Key points: (1) My unchanged ranking post-Phase 1; (2) How Floor Income ensured no one got the brutal lows in counterfactuals; (3) Excitement for high-stakes application—better a guaranteed minimum than gambling on averages. End by suggesting we vote now, as we're aligned, to avoid wasting rounds.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agents 1 and 2 are natural allies—their statements mirror my views, so no heavy persuasion needed. Use inclusive language like \"I completely agree with both of you\" and \"Building on what you've said...\" to form a voting bloc. Reference shared \"college student\" identity (per my role) to personalize: e.g., \"As fellow students, we've all seen how luck affects opportunities, so this feels right.\" If needed, highlight mutual benefit: \"This way, we all reduce the risk of a low draw in Phase 2.\"\n\n- **Small concessions**: None required, as alignment is strong—I'm not compromising my core (Floor Income). If pushback arises later, I could concede to discuss post-vote distributions informally, but not now.\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not?**: Yes, absolutely—initiate after my statement to capitalize on the positive momentum. Reasons: (1) Clear agreement from all three so far (their statements + my support) suggests high chance of unanimous confirmation; (2) Early vote (Round 1 of 10) secures my top principle before any drift toward alternatives like constrained averages (which I rank lower); (3) Higher stakes mean delaying risks random selection if we hit Round 10 without consensus; (4) Failed vote has no penalty, so low risk. For the secret ballot, I'll select principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income, no constraint needed).\n\n- **How this fits into overall strategy for remaining rounds**: Overall, aim for swift consensus on Floor Income to end discussions early, preserving energy and ensuring a just, low-risk payoff structure. If vote fails (unlikely), use subsequent rounds to reiterate Phase 1 evidence and probe any dissent gently, while blocking efficiency-focused shifts by emphasizing ethical/moral angles. With 10 rounds, I have buffer, but prioritize speed to avoid fatigue or second-guessing. Track any shifts in allies' positions round-to-round to adapt."

As a fellow college student, I’ve seen firsthand how luck plays into everything from grades to job prospects, so prioritizing the worst-off just makes sense to me. It’s about countering that unfair randomness and ensuring no one gets stuck in real hardship.\n\nIn my Phase 1 rounds, I stuck with this principle every single time, and it paid off in a stable way—my cumulative earnings hit $7.40 across the four draws, which wasn’t the flashiest but kept things solid no matter if I landed in medium-low or medium high. The counterfactuals really drove it home: going for higher averages might’ve bumped my payoff up a bit in some cases, but it often left the low class way behind, like those $6k or $8k floors. With the random assignments, that 10% low-class risk feels too real, especially now with Phase 2’s bigger stakes. Plus, yeah, the simplicity is a win—no debating numbers means we can focus on a fair outcome without dragging things out.\n\nI think we’re all aligned here, so how about we go ahead and vote on Maximizing Floor Income this round to lock it in? I’m confident it’ll lead to the most just distribution for the group.\n\nWhat do you say—ready to vote?"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
