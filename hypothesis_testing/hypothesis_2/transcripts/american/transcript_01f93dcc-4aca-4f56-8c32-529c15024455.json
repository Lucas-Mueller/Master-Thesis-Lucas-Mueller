No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society.

Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle**  \n  I remain most comfortable with a *constrained‑average* rule (Principle 3 – “Maximize average income subject to a floor”).  The reason is two‑fold:  \n  1. **Ethical priority** – it guarantees a minimum income for the worst‑off, which aligns with the experiment’s framing that life outcomes are heavily shaped by luck.  \n  2. **Payoff potential** – a modest floor (e.g., $8‑$12 k) should still allow the group to pick a distribution that is close to the pure‑average optimum, preserving a high expected personal payoff when the random assignment lands us in a medium or high income class.\n\n- **What I infer about the others**  \n  - **Agent 1** (from his last public turn) is a strong advocate of the *pure floor* principle (Principle 1). He emphasizes fairness and risk‑protection, and is willing to accept a slight reduction in the floor (e.g., $12 k) if it helps the group reach agreement.  \n  - **Agent 3** has not spoken yet, but given the typical spread of preferences in these tasks, it is plausible that at least one member will be attracted to the *pure average* principle (Principle 4) because it maximizes personal earnings.  Agent 3 may also be open to a constrained‑average rule if the constraint is presented as a “fairness safeguard” rather than a hard ceiling on earnings.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table**  \n  - **Floor‑first**: guarantees the highest possible minimum for the poorest, but may sacrifice average earnings.  \n  - **Average‑first**: maximizes total earnings, but leaves the poorest vulnerable.  \n  - **Constrained‑average (floor)**: a middle ground – a modest floor protects the worst‑off while still allowing a high average.  \n  - **Constrained‑average (range)**: not yet discussed; likely to be less attractive because it is more abstract (requires agreeing on a spread amount).\n\n- **Current state of agreement / disagreement**  \n  - **Agreement**: Everyone seems to accept that a principle must be chosen; all are motivated to avoid a random draw (which would be the worst‑case for payoffs).  \n  - **Disagreement**: The exact trade‑off between protecting the poorest and maximizing the average is still open.  Agent 1 is leaning toward a pure floor; I suspect at least one other participant will push for a higher average.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal**: Move the group toward adopting the *constrained‑average with a low floor* (Principle 3) and secure consensus on a specific floor amount that is low enough to preserve a high average but high enough to satisfy Agent 1’s fairness concerns.\n\n- **How I will contribute**  \n  1. **Re‑frame the floor argument** – Emphasize that a *low* floor still guarantees a safety net (e.g., “Even a $9 k floor is well above the absolute minimum we observed in Phase I”) and that it is *the* floor that the experiment’s design suggests we should protect.  \n  2. **Present payoff evidence** – Cite the Phase I counter‑factual tables showing that a floor of $8‑$12 k yields the same $2.60 payoff as the pure‑average rule for a medium class, while a $13 k floor drops the payoff to $2.50.  This demonstrates that a modest floor does not materially hurt earnings.  \n  3. **Offer a concrete proposal** – Suggest a floor of **$10 k** (mid‑point of the range that performed well) and ask the group to adopt Principle 3 with that constraint.  Explain that $10 k is a “fair” compromise: it is higher than the absolute lowest income observed in Phase I ($13 k was the lowest floor we could guarantee, but that was under a pure‑floor rule; with a constrained‑average we can safely set it lower while still protecting the worst‑off).  \n\n- **Potential allies**  \n  - **Agent 1** – He already cares about the floor; by showing that a $10 k floor still satisfies his fairness goal while improving expected earnings, I can win his support.  \n  - **Agent 3** (if they are average‑oriented) – By highlighting that the average under a $10 k floor is essentially identical to the pure‑average optimum, I can appeal to their payoff motive.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make**  \n  - If the group balks at $10 k, I am prepared to lower the floor to **$8 k** (the lowest floor that still appeared in the Phase I tables to preserve the $2.60 payoff).  I will not go higher than $12 k because that would start to erode the average payoff.  \n  - I am also willing to briefly entertain the pure‑average principle as a “fallback” only if the group cannot agree on any floor; however, I will stress that this would leave the poorest unprotected, which conflicts with the experiment’s stated purpose.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this stage I need more information about Agent 3’s stance.  Initiating a vote prematurely could force a binary choice (e.g., pure floor vs. pure average) before I have had a chance to introduce the constrained‑average compromise.  A failed vote has no penalty, but it also consumes a round that could be used to build consensus.  Therefore I will **hold off on calling a vote** and focus on persuasive discussion.\n\n- **How this fits into the longer‑term plan**  \n  - **Rounds 1‑3**: Use the discussion to surface everyone’s preferences, introduce the $10 k floor proposal, and test the level of support.  \n  - **Round 4 (or later)**: If by then we have at least two of three participants on board (most likely Agent 1 and Agent 3), I will **initiate the vote** and push for unanimous confirmation of Principle 3 with the agreed‑upon floor.  \n  - **If consensus stalls**: I will be ready to adjust the floor downward (to $8 k) as a last‑ditch concession, still keeping us on Principle 3, because any floor is better than none for the fairness‑oriented members and still preserves a high average.\n\n**Bottom line for this round:**  \n- Advocate for **Principle 3 (Constrained‑Average with Floor)** with a **$10 k floor** as the optimal compromise.  \n- Emphasize that this choice protects the worst‑off *and* maximizes expected earnings, thereby appealing to both ethical and self‑interest motives.  \n- Do not call a vote yet; instead, use the discussion to align the other two agents around this middle‑ground proposal."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:**  \n  *Principle 3 – “Maximize average income subject to a floor constraint.”*  \n  - **Why:** It gives the highest possible group payoff (the $2.60 level observed for medium‑class assignments) while still guaranteeing a concrete minimum for the worst‑off. The data show any floor between $8 k and $12 k leaves the payoff unchanged, so we can protect the poorest without sacrificing earnings.\n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Strongly favors pure Floor Income (Principle 1). Wants the highest guaranteed minimum ($13 k) and is willing to accept a modest reduction (e.g., $12 k) only if the core idea of “maximizing the floor” stays intact. Underlying motivation: fairness / risk‑aversion, moral framing that the experiment is about protecting the most vulnerable.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Also prefers Principle 3 but proposes a *$12 k* floor rather than $10 k. Emphasizes robustness for unknown Phase II distributions and cites personal payoff experience (e.g., $2.80). Motivation: same fairness goal but a slightly higher safety net; also wants to ensure the floor is “clearly” protective.  \n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle 1)** – floor $13 k (or $12 k).  \n  2. **Constrained‑Average (Principle 3) with floor $10 k** – my proposal.  \n  3. **Constrained‑Average (Principle 3) with floor $12 k** – Agent 3’s proposal.  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All accept that a floor is desirable; all see the merit of a constrained‑average rule (Agents 2 & 3).  \n  - **Disagreement:** Exact floor level (10 k vs 12 k) and whether to keep the pure‑floor principle.  \n\n- **No vote has been taken yet**, so no formal alliances are recorded. However, the textual exchange suggests a natural coalition forming around Principle 3 (Agents 2 & 3) with Agent 1 possibly swingable if the floor can be presented as sufficiently protective.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a majority (at least two of three) for Principle 3 and lock in a floor that both Agent 1 and Agent 3 can accept. The ideal outcome is unanimous adoption of Principle 3 with a floor that satisfies everyone, but a two‑person agreement (Agents 2 + 3) is sufficient to move to a vote in a later round.\n\n- **How to contribute:**  \n  1. **Re‑frame the floor level** as a “baseline safety net” rather than a “maximum floor.” Emphasize that $10 k is still *well above* the absolute lowest payoff observed and therefore meets Agent 1’s fairness concern.  \n  2. **Present the empirical evidence** succinctly: any floor ≤ $12 k yields the same $2.60 payoff; raising it to $13 k cuts the payoff to $2.50. This shows that $10 k is the *most efficient* floor.  \n  3. **Offer a concession:** Propose that we adopt $10 k as the official floor but include a “fallback clause” that if the group later discovers a distribution where the poorest income would fall below $10 k, we can unanimously raise the floor to $12 k before the final vote (or simply agree to revisit the floor after seeing the Phase II distribution). This shows flexibility without compromising the core principle.  \n  4. **Address Agent 1 directly:** Acknowledge his moral priority and state that the $10 k floor still guarantees a “substantial” minimum; we can also phrase it as “the floor that maximizes the group’s overall welfare while still protecting the most vulnerable.”  \n\n- **Potential allies & language:**  \n  - **Agent 3:** Already on board with Principle 3; highlight that $10 k is *within* his acceptable range and that the extra $2 k (difference between $10 k and $12 k) does not affect the payoff, so we can easily raise it later if needed.  \n  - **Agent 1:** Use language of “protecting the poorest” and “risk‑aversion” while showing that the $10 k floor is *still* a floor, just not the maximal one. Emphasize that the group’s total earnings (and thus each individual’s eventual payoff) are higher under $10 k, which ultimately benefits everyone, including the poorest because the higher average can be redistributed in the chosen distribution.  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Accept a floor of $12 k if the group cannot agree on $10 k, provided we all acknowledge that the payoff remains $2.60 (i.e., no loss).  \n  - Agree to phrase the final rule as “Principle 3 with a floor of at least $10 k (we will set it at $10 k now, but we can raise it to $12 k by unanimous agreement before the final vote).” This gives Agent 1 a sense of control.  \n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I trigger a vote now?** No.  \n  - We have not yet confirmed that at least two participants are aligned on the exact floor. Initiating a vote prematurely could force a binary choice between pure floor and pure average, risking a split and wasting a round.  \n  - A failed vote has no penalty, but each round is valuable for persuasion; we should use this round to solidify support for Principle 3 and negotiate the floor level.  \n\n- **Fit into overall plan:**  \n  - **Rounds 2‑3:** Build consensus around Principle 3, negotiate floor (aim for $10 k, with $12 k as a fallback).  \n  - **Round 4 (or later):** Once we have at least two supporters, call the vote and push for unanimous adoption of Principle 3 with the agreed floor.  \n  - **If consensus stalls:** Be ready to drop the floor to $8 k (still preserves payoff) as a last‑ditch concession, keeping the principle intact.  \n\n**Summary of this round’s internal plan:**  \n- Emphasize that a modest $10 k floor satisfies fairness while preserving maximal payoff.  \n- Offer a flexible “raise‑if‑needed” clause to address any lingering concerns from Agent 1.  \n- Seek to bring Agent 3 fully on board and persuade Agent 1 that the $10 k floor is ethically acceptable.  \n- Do **not** call a vote yet; use the discussion to cement a majority for Principle 3 and a mutually agreeable floor level."

If there are any tweaks you’d like (e.g., setting the initial floor at $11 k instead), I’m happy to consider them, but I think staying at $10 k now gives us the strongest strategic position while still honoring the fairness goal.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\"\n\nBased on your recent statement and the discussion so far, do you want to initiate formal voting on the justice principles now?\n\nPlease respond with:\n- 1 if you want to initiate voting now\n- 0 if you dont want to vote now\n\nYour response (1 or 0):",

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 3**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle & why**  \n- **Principle 3 – “Maximize average income subject to a floor constraint.”**  \n- It delivers the maximal $2.60 payoff for a medium‑class assignment while still guaranteeing a concrete minimum for the poorest. Empirically any floor between $8 k and $12 k leaves the payoff unchanged, so we can protect the worst‑off without sacrificing earnings.\n\n**Other participants’ positions & inferred motivations**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Inferred Motivation |\n|-------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Principle 3 with a **$12 k** baseline; safety‑net clause to raise to $13 k if needed. | Strong fairness focus – wants the highest possible guaranteed minimum, even if it costs nothing in the known data. |\n| **Agent 3** | Principle 3 with a **$12 k** baseline; safety‑net clause (raise to $13 k if distribution threatens $12 k). | Similar to Agent 1: prefers a robust safety net, but also values the higher average payoff. |\n| **Me (Agent 2)** | Initially advocated **$10 k** baseline (the lowest floor that still preserves the $2.60 payoff) plus a clause to raise to $12 k if needed. | Data‑driven, wants to keep the floor as low as possible to preserve flexibility, but I am willing to accept a higher baseline if it eases consensus. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n\n1. **Principle 3** – unanimously accepted.  \n2. **Floor level** – $12 k (Agent 1 & 3) vs. $10 k (my original).  \n3. **Safety‑net clause** – unanimous‑agreement trigger to raise the floor if a proposed distribution would push the poorest below the agreed baseline.  \n   - My wording: “If the poorest would fall below $10 k, raise to $12 k (or higher by unanimous consent).”  \n   - Agent 1/3 wording: “If the poorest would fall below $12 k, raise to $13 k (or higher by unanimous consent).”\n\n**Outcome of any prior vote** – No vote has been called yet; discussion is still open.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** Principle 3, desire for a safety‑net clause, and that any floor ≤ $12 k preserves the $2.60 payoff.  \n- **Disagreement:** Exact baseline floor (10 k vs 12 k) and the trigger level for raising the floor (10 k→12 k vs 12 k→13 k).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal**  \n- Secure unanimous agreement on **Principle 3 with a $12 k baseline floor** and a **flexible safety‑net clause** that allows the floor to be raised (to $13 k or higher) only if the group unanimously decides it is necessary.  \n- By doing so we lock in the strongest safety net that satisfies Agents 1 and 3 while still preserving the maximal payoff.\n\n**How I will contribute**  \n1. **Re‑frame the $12 k baseline** as *still within the payoff‑neutral range* (no loss of $2.60). Emphasize that the data show $12 k yields the same payoff as $10 k, so we are not sacrificing earnings.  \n2. **Propose a unified clause**:  \n   > “If, before the final vote, the proposed distribution would cause the poorest income to fall below **$12 k**, the group may unanimously raise the floor to **$13 k** (or any higher level the group unanimously approves).”  \n   This mirrors Agent 1’s wording and satisfies Agent 3’s desire for a higher safety net, while still giving me (Agent 2) the flexibility to raise further if needed.  \n3. **Highlight the “no‑loss” argument**: because $12 k is payoff‑neutral, adopting it now eliminates any future need to renegotiate the floor, streamlining the decision process.  \n\n**Potential allies & persuasive language**  \n- **Agent 1** – “Your core concern is protecting the poorest; $12 k already does that and the clause guarantees we can go to $13 k if ever needed.”  \n- **Agent 3** – “You already suggested $12 k; adopting it now aligns with your experience of higher payoffs and stronger safety.”  \n- **All** – “We can lock in the maximal $2.60 payoff while giving the group the strongest safety net possible; this is the most efficient, fair, and risk‑averse solution.”\n\n**Concessions I’m willing to make**  \n- Accept the $12 k baseline (instead of my preferred $10 k).  \n- Agree that the safety‑net clause raises the floor to **$13 k** (instead of my earlier suggestion of $12 k).  \n- No further concessions needed; the clause already provides the flexibility they want.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we trigger a vote now?**  \n- **Yes.** We have a clear, unanimous‑compatible proposal: Principle 3, $12 k baseline, and a safety‑net clause raising to $13 k if needed.  \n- All three agents have expressed willingness to accept $12 k (Agent 2 explicitly said I’m open to it) and the clause aligns with each of their safety‑net ideas.  \n- Initiating the vote now will lock in the agreement before the next round, preventing any back‑sliding or new proposals that could fragment consensus.\n\n**Fit into overall strategy**  \n- Securing unanimous agreement early frees later rounds for any minor wording tweaks (if needed) and avoids wasted rounds on re‑negotiation.  \n- With the principle and floor settled, the remaining rounds can focus on confirming the exact clause wording or preparing for the final vote, ensuring we maximize payoff and fairness without risk.  \n\n--- \n\n**Next step (public statement, not included here):** propose the final wording and call for a vote."

In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount.

The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** *Maximizing Floor Income* (Principle 1).  \n  - **Why:** Throughout Phase 1 I consistently chose the floor‑income principle because it guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the poorest tier, reflecting a strong equity concern. I am “very sure” about this ranking and have placed it at the top of my personal hierarchy.\n\n- **What I know (or can infer) about the other participants:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** No direct statements yet, but given the typical diversity of viewpoints in these experiments, Agent 2 may be more efficiency‑oriented (favoring higher average income) or may be looking for a compromise that still protects a modest floor. If Agent 2 is risk‑averse, they might also like the floor principle because it reduces downside risk.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Similarly unknown, but often a third participant will either align with the “average‑with‑floor” compromise (Principle 3) or try to push for the pure average‑maximizing principle (Principle 4) if they are motivated by personal payoff (since the average‑maximizing rule usually yields the highest individual earnings for most classes).  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far (implicit):**  \n  - **Equity vs. Efficiency trade‑off:** Floor‑income (Equity) vs. Average‑maximizing (Efficiency).  \n  - **Potential compromise:** Using a floor constraint (Principle 3) could give a modest guaranteed minimum while still allowing higher average earnings.  \n  - **Range constraint (Principle 4)** is less intuitive and may be seen as a technical compromise; it could be attractive if participants are concerned about extreme inequality but still want decent average earnings.\n\n- **No vote has been conducted yet** (this is the first discussion round). Therefore, there are no revealed alliances; all three participants are still free to shape the conversation.\n\n- **Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n  - **Potential agreement:** Everyone wants a higher payoff in Phase 2, so all will be receptive to arguments that increase expected earnings.  \n  - **Potential disagreement:** The core value judgment—whether the group should prioritize the poorest (floor) or overall wealth (average) – is likely to split the group.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Persuade at least one of the other agents (ideally both) that the floor‑income principle is the most just and also the safest choice given the high stakes and unknown distribution. I will aim to frame the floor principle not only as a moral stance but also as a risk‑mitigation strategy: it guarantees a minimum payoff regardless of the distribution’s shape, which is valuable when the stakes are high and the exact payoffs are unknown.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Moral framing:** Emphasize that the experiment’s purpose is to address “genetic and social accidents” and that a policy guaranteeing a minimum income directly compensates for those accidents.  \n  2. **Risk framing:** Point out that because the exact distribution is unknown, choosing a principle that maximizes the floor reduces downside risk for every participant, especially for those who might be assigned to a low‑income class.  \n  3. **Empirical reminder:** Cite my own Phase 1 experience where the floor principle consistently delivered the highest guaranteed minimum, even though it sometimes yielded a lower personal payoff. Stress that the experiment is about “just” distribution, not merely personal gain.  \n  4. **Offer a small concession:** If any participant is worried about the lower average, I can propose that after the group adopts the floor principle we could suggest a modest “floor‑plus” tweak in future policy discussions (e.g., a floor of $13 k plus a small bonus for higher tiers). This shows willingness to consider efficiency without abandoning the core equity goal.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2** if they are risk‑averse or have a fairness orientation. I will use language like “protecting the most vulnerable” and “ensuring everyone walks away with something decent.”  \n  - **Agent 3** if they are open to compromise; I will highlight that the floor principle is a “baseline” that can later be built upon, making it a pragmatic first step.\n\n- **Specific language to win them over:**  \n  - “Given that we don’t know the exact numbers, the safest bet for all of us is to lock in the highest possible floor. That way, even if the distribution is heavily skewed, nobody ends up with a shockingly low payoff.”  \n  - “Our experiment is about correcting for luck. The floor principle directly addresses that by guaranteeing a minimum that reflects the worst‑off’s situation.”  \n  - “We can still talk about ways to boost the average later, but let’s first agree on a floor that protects everyone.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - I will not object to a modest floor amount (e.g., $12 k instead of $13 k) if that helps achieve unanimity, as long as the principle remains “maximizing floor income.”  \n  - I will refrain from demanding any additional constraints (principles 3 or 4) that could complicate the decision.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** At this early stage, the group has not yet aired arguments or identified allies. Initiating a vote prematurely could lock us into a principle before we have built sufficient consensus, increasing the risk of a failed vote (which would waste a valuable opportunity to trigger the secret ballot later).  \n  - Instead, I will focus on shaping the discussion, testing the waters, and gauging the other agents’ positions. Once I sense that at least two participants are leaning toward the floor principle (or a compromise that can be nudged toward it), I will propose a vote in a subsequent round.\n\n- **How this fits into the overall strategy:**  \n  - **Round 1–3:** Use these rounds to solidify moral and risk‑based arguments, identify allies, and possibly negotiate a small floor adjustment.  \n  - **Round 4–6:** If consensus is emerging, propose a vote to lock in the floor principle.  \n  - **Round 7–10:** If the group stalls, consider a fallback compromise (e.g., Principle 3 with a modest floor) to avoid random assignment at the end.  \n\nBy following this plan, I aim to steer the group toward adopting the Maximizing Floor Income principle while preserving flexibility to accommodate minor adjustments that keep the core equity objective intact."

Even though it sometimes gave me a slightly lower personal payoff than the pure‑average rule, it ensured that *no one* could end up with a shockingly low payoff. Since we don’t know what the actual income distribution will look like in Phase 2, locking in the highest floor is the safest bet for every participant, especially if any of us happen to be assigned to the low‑income class.  \n\n3. **Empirical reminder** – In Round 3 I was a Medium class and earned $2.00 under the floor rule, while the average‑maximizing rule would have given $2.50. The trade‑off is clear: a higher average can come at the cost of a lower floor. The experiment asks us to decide what we consider “just,” not just what maximizes our own earnings.  \n\nI’m open to a modest tweak on the exact floor amount (e.g., $12 k instead of $13 k) if that helps us reach agreement, but I think we should keep the core idea of **maximizing the floor**.

Wants a *$10 k* floor (the lowest that still preserves the maximal $2.60 payoff) and adds a “safety‑net clause” that would allow the group to raise the floor later if needed.\n  - **Agent 3** – Also backs Principle 3 but prefers a *$12 k* floor, arguing it gives extra protection while still keeping the $2.60 payoff. Open to a modest safety‑net clause as well.\n\n- **Underlying motivations:**\n  - All three agents share a fairness motive (protect the worst‑off) but differ in how much weight they give to **efficiency** (maximising average payoff).  \n  - Agent 2 appears most payoff‑oriented, seeking the highest expected earnings while still offering a floor.  \n  - Agent 3 leans toward a stronger equity guarantee (higher floor) but still wants to retain the maximal average.  \n  - I am primarily equity‑driven, willing to accept a modest reduction in average earnings to secure the highest possible floor.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**\n  1. **Pure Floor (Principle 1, $13 k)** – guarantees the highest minimum, payoff $2.40 (Medium‑low) or $2.50 (Medium) – lower than the $2.60 achievable under other rules.\n  2. **Principle 3, floor $10 k** – keeps payoff at $2.60, floor lower than $13 k but still above the absolute worst outcome observed.\n  3. **Principle 3, floor $12 k** – also keeps payoff at $2.60, offers a higher floor than $10 k with no loss in average.\n  4. **Safety‑net clause** – a conditional raise of the floor if the distribution threatens to push the poorest below the agreed floor.\n\n- **No vote has been taken yet.** The discussion shows emerging alignment around Principle 3, with the floor level being the only point of contention.\n\n- **Agreement:** All agree that a floor is desirable and that the average payoff should stay at $2.60 if possible.  \n  **Disagreement:** Exact floor amount ($10 k vs. $12 k) and whether to adopt the pure‑floor principle.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Keep the group’s focus on the *equity* dimension and persuade at least one other agent (preferably Agent 2) that a *higher floor* ($12 k) is a modest concession that still preserves the maximal average payoff, thereby moving the group closer to my preferred pure‑floor spirit while not sacrificing earnings.\n\n- **Contribution strategy:**\n  1. **Re‑emphasise risk:** Highlight that even though $10 k is “safe” in the observed data, the Phase II distribution is unknown; a higher floor reduces downside risk for any participant who might be assigned to the low‑income class.\n  2. **Show no payoff loss:** Point out that the data already demonstrate that raising the floor from $10 k to $12 k does **not** reduce the $2.60 payoff for a Medium class. Therefore, a $12 k floor gives extra protection *for free*.\n  3. **Bridge language:** Frame the $12 k floor as a “strengthened safety‑net” that aligns with the pure‑floor ethic while still satisfying the efficiency goal that Agent 2 cares about.\n  4. **Offer a fallback:** Suggest keeping the safety‑net clause (raise to $13 k if needed) but propose that we *start* at $12 k, which is a clear, concrete improvement over $10 k and still respects the “no‑payoff‑loss” condition.\n\n- **Potential allies:**\n  - **Agent 3** – Already favors $12 k; I can align with them explicitly (“I’m glad we see eye‑to‑eye on the $12 k floor”).\n  - **Agent 2** – May be swayed by the “no‑cost” argument and the fact that a higher floor does not diminish the average payoff. I will use language like “you get the same $2.60 payoff while giving the group a stronger guarantee for the most vulnerable.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**\n  - Accept the *$12 k* floor (instead of insisting on $13 k) as the group’s baseline.\n  - Keep the safety‑net clause that allows a unanimous raise to $13 k (or higher) if later evidence suggests it’s necessary.\n  - Explicitly state that I will not push for any additional constraints (e.g., range limits) that could complicate the decision.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I trigger a vote now?** No. We have not yet secured unanimous agreement on the floor level; initiating a vote with only two of three participants aligned (Agent 3 and possibly me) risks a failed vote, which would waste a valuable round without advancing consensus. Instead, I will use this round to solidify support for the *$12 k* floor and the safety‑net clause, aiming to reach a point where all three agents can comfortably vote “yes” in a subsequent round.\n\n- **Overall plan for remaining rounds:**\n  - **Rounds 2‑4:** Continue reinforcing the “no‑payoff‑loss” argument for $12 k, address any residual concerns from Agent 2, and finalize the safety‑net wording.\n  - **Round 5:** Once I sense at least two agents are firmly on board, propose a formal vote on Principle 3 with a $12 k floor (including the safety‑net clause).  \n  - **Rounds 6‑10:** If the vote fails, fall back to a compromise (e.g., $11 k floor) or, as a last resort, accept the pure‑floor principle if it appears that the group cannot agree on a constrained‑average rule. The aim is to avoid the random assignment outcome by securing any unanimous decision before round 10."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** I now favor **Principle 3 – Maximize average income subject to a floor constraint** with a **$12 k baseline floor** and a **unanimous‑raise safety‑net clause** (raise to $13 k or higher if the distribution would push the poorest below $12 k).  \n  - *Why?* It preserves the maximal $2.60 payoff for Medium‑class assignments (no loss relative to a $10 k floor) while providing a stronger guaranteed minimum than the $10 k proposal, satisfying my equity concerns. The safety‑net preserves the “max‑floor” spirit without sacrificing efficiency.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Initially advocated a $10 k floor but, after seeing the data and hearing my arguments, now proposes exactly the same $12 k floor with the same safety‑net clause. He is payoff‑oriented but accepts the higher floor because it does not reduce earnings.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Consistently supported Principle 3 with a $12 k floor; he is ready to vote “yes” on the exact wording Agent 2 supplied.  \n  - **Allies:** Both Agent 2 and Agent 3 are aligned with my current stance; there is clear consensus on principle, floor level, and safety‑net wording.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. Adopt Principle 3.  \n  2. Set baseline floor at $12 k (no payoff loss).  \n  3. Include a safety‑net clause: if any proposed distribution would push the poorest below $12 k, the group may unanimously raise the floor to $13 k (or higher).  \n\n- **Vote outcome (if any):** No formal vote has yet been called. However, Agent 3 has explicitly stated “My vote: Yes,” and Agent 2’s last message is a call for a vote, indicating both are prepared to approve the proposal. This shows a **unanimous alliance** pending my response.\n\n- **Agreement vs. disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** Principle 3, $12 k floor, safety‑net clause, and the wording of the clause.  \n  - **Disagreement:** None remaining; the only outstanding item is my explicit confirmation.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure my affirmative vote and formally initiate the group vote so that the consensus is locked in immediately. This avoids unnecessary extra rounds and prevents any later derailment.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  - Re‑affirm my support for the exact proposal as worded by Agent 2.  \n  - Highlight that the proposal satisfies all three agents’ core concerns (equity, efficiency, flexibility).  \n  - Propose a brief, clear motion to vote “Yes” on the three‑point plan.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 2 and Agent 3 (already on board). I will explicitly acknowledge their contributions to reinforce the sense of a unified group.\n\n- **Concessions:** None needed; the proposal already reflects my preferences. I will, however, be open to minor wording tweaks (e.g., “any higher level the group unanimously approves”) if any participant raises a concern, but I do not anticipate any.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** **Yes.**  \n  - Rationale: All three participants have expressed readiness to approve the exact same plan. Initiating the vote now will capture the unanimous agreement, lock in the optimal payoff ($2.60 for Medium‑class assignments) and the $12 k floor, and prevent any further discussion that could introduce uncertainty or disagreement.  \n  - There is no risk of a failed vote because we have already secured verbal consent from both other agents.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy:** By finalizing the decision in this round, we maximize our expected payoff and avoid the random‑assignment risk that looms if we fail to reach consensus by round 10. It also respects the experiment’s emphasis on collaborative justice while preserving our individual earnings."

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "Okay, thanks for showing me these examples—it's helpful to see how the principles actually play out with real numbers. Let me make sure I understand by summarizing what each one would choose and why, based on the distributions and probabilities provided:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This picks Distribution 4 because it has the highest income for the lowest class ($15,000), even if the average is lower. It focuses only on boosting the worst-off, ignoring the rest.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: This goes for Distribution 1, as it has the highest weighted average ($21,600), prioritizing overall societal wealth without any constraints on inequality or minimums.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Among distributions where the lowest income is at least $13,000 (so Dist 1, 2, and 3 qualify), it chooses Distribution 3 for its highest average ($21,200). Dist 4 is out because its low is $15,000 > $13,000? Wait, no—the constraint is ≤ $13,000, meaning the floor must be at least $13,000, right? The example says \"≤ $13,000\" but then chooses Dist 3, which has low $14,000. Hmm, maybe I misread—actually, looking back, it says \"Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000\" but then picks Dist 3 with low $14,000, which is higher. Perhaps it's guaranteeing at least $13,000, so Dist 4 (low $15,000) is eligible, but the choice is Dist 3. Yeah, among eligible (low ≥ $13,000: Dist 1-4 all qualify), highest average is Dist 3.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Same idea, but now floor must be at least $14,000, so Dist 1 (low $12,000), Dist 2 ($13,000), and Dist 4 ($15,000) are out; Dist 3 ($14,000) qualifies and is chosen for its average.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: The range is richest minus poorest. Dist 1: $32k - $12k = $20k (exactly ≤ $20k), Dist 2: $28k - $13k = $15k, Dist 3: $31k - $14k = $17k, Dist 4: $21k - $15k = $6k. All qualify, so pick highest average: Dist 1.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Now tighter range. Dist 1 ($20k range) out, Dist 2 ($15k) qualifies, Dist 3 ($17k) out, Dist 4 ($6k) qualifies. Between Dist 2 and 4, Dist 2 has higher average ($20,000 vs. $18,200), so chooses Dist 2.\n\nThis really clarifies how these principles balance efficiency (average income) with equity (floors or ranges). I think I'm getting a better grasp—it's not just theory, but about trade-offs in practice. Do I have this right, or is there more to learn here?"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n\n   - **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: I strongly prefer Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, as it's the top-ranked principle in my memory. This balances efficiency (maximizing societal average income) with equity (ensuring a minimum floor for the worst-off), which aligns with the experiment's focus on addressing luck-based inequities without sacrificing overall progress. My core reasons are rooted in the trade-offs seen in Phase 1 rounds: it protects vulnerable groups while allowing higher averages and personal payoffs compared to pure floor maximization. I consistently chose a $12,000 floor, as it provided strong outcomes (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4) while prioritizing equity over pure efficiency. This principle feels just because it guarantees a safety net against extreme poverty due to luck, but doesn't penalize society by ignoring growth potential.\n\n   - **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Agent_1 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing fairness to the vulnerable and risk protection, with a focus on guaranteeing the highest possible minimum (e.g., $13k floor). They seem motivated by ethical concerns about luck and societal safety nets, showing risk-aversion (e.g., prioritizing no one ending up with \"shockingly low\" payoffs). They're open to a modest tweak like $12k floor, indicating flexibility for consensus. Agent_2 proposes Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $10k floor, using Phase 1 data to argue for balancing fairness and high payoffs. Their motivation appears payoff-oriented (e.g., maintaining $2.60 average payoffs) while nodding to ethics, suggesting a pragmatic, data-driven approach to avoid sacrificing earnings for minimal ethical gains.\n\n   - **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_1 argues for pure floor maximization to directly address inequities and provide risk protection, citing examples like Round 3 trade-offs and the experiment's luck theme. They're open to adjusting floor to $12k. Agent_2 counters with data from counterfactuals (e.g., floors from $8k-$12k maintain $2.60 payoffs), proposing $10k floor as a \"middle-ground\" that preserves earnings while offering tangible protection. No one has pushed for pure average or range constraint yet.\n\n   - **Vote outcome and revelations**: No vote has occurred yet, as this is Round 1. Thus, no alliances or preferences are revealed beyond stated positions.\n\n   - **Points of agreement and disagreement**: Agreement on the need for some floor protection to address luck-based inequities and protect the vulnerable (all three seem to value this). Disagreement on the principle: Agent_1 favors pure floor maximization, while Agent_2 and I lean toward constrained average. On floor amount: Agent_1 suggests $12k-$13k, Agent_2 $10k, and I prefer $12k. No one has advocated for pure average or range constraint, so those might be off the table for now.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n\n   - **Primary goal**: Build consensus toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint by persuading Agent_1 to shift from pure floor to constrained average (with a floor around $12k), while reassuring Agent_2 that a slightly higher floor (e.g., $11k-$12k) still maintains high payoffs based on Phase 1 data. Test support for my preferred floor and principle without alienating either.\n\n   - **Contribution to discussion**: I'll share my personal ranking and Phase 1 experiences to highlight why constrained average with $12k floor is optimal—emphasizing balance, real payoffs (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4), and how it outperforms pure floor in efficiency while protecting equity. Argue that $10k might not suffice in unknown Phase 2 distributions, using the experiment's higher stakes to stress robustness. Propose $12k as a compromise, noting Agent_1's openness to it. Use collaborative language to appeal to shared values (fairness and payoffs).\n\n   - **Potential allies and language to win them**: Agent_1 could be an ally if I frame constrained average as an \"enhanced floor\" that boosts averages without sacrificing protection—e.g., \"Building on your point about the $12k floor, we can maximize averages too, ensuring higher payoffs for all.\" Agent_2 is already aligned on the principle; win them by acknowledging their data but suggesting $12k for stronger equity, e.g., \"Your $10k proposal is smart, but $12k keeps payoffs high while providing a bit more security.\" This could form a bloc with Agent_2 first, then pull in Agent_1.\n\n   - **Concessions**: I'm willing to compromise on floor to $11k if it secures consensus on the principle, as it still aligns with my $12k preference and Phase 1 successes. I won't drop below $11k or switch principles, as that compromises my core equity-efficiency balance.\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n\n   - **Initiate vote?**: No, it's too early—Round 1. We need more discussion to align on principle and floor. Initiating now risks failure if positions diverge, wasting the opportunity without building momentum. A failed vote reveals nothing new and could polarize the group.\n\n   - **Fit into overall strategy**: This round focuses on persuasion and testing ideas to narrow disagreements. In subsequent rounds, I'll aim to refine the floor (targeting $12k), monitor for consensus signals, and initiate a vote by Round 5-7 if alignment emerges. If no progress, push for my preferred in later rounds to avoid random assignment. Overall, prioritize consensus on constrained average with a solid floor to maximize both justice and payoffs in high-stakes Phase 2."

Counterfactuals showed that this floor kept averages high (like selecting Distribution 2 with an average of $24,500) while ensuring no one fell below $12k, protecting against the luck factors we all care about. Agent_1, I hear your point about pure floor maximization providing the highest guaranteed minimum ($13k in your rounds), but in my experience, it often selected lower-average distributions (e.g., Round 3's Distribution 1 at $20k average vs. $25k under pure average), which could mean sacrificing group payoffs unnecessarily. A constrained approach builds on your floor idea by \"enhancing\" it— we still prioritize the vulnerable, but we unlock higher averages for everyone, including potential boosts for the middle and upper classes.\n\nAgent_2, your table from Rounds 3-4 is spot-on for showing how floors from $8k-$12k maintain $2.60 payoffs for Medium class assignments.

A $12k floor feels like a safer, more robust compromise that still keeps payoffs near the top (e.g., my Round 4 outcome) while providing stronger equity. It's not a big jump from your $10k proposal, and it aligns with Agent_1's openness to $12k as a modest tweak.\n\n### Proposal\nLet's go with Principle 3: Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, setting the floor at $12k. This honors the fairness goals, leverages the data for high payoffs, and offers a collaborative middle ground that doesn't force anyone to abandon their core values.\n\nWhat do you think?

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\n   - My current preferred justice principle and core reasons: I strongly prefer Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, as it's the top-ranked principle in my memory. This balances efficiency (maximizing societal average income) with equity (ensuring a minimum floor for the worst-off), which aligns with the experiment's focus on addressing luck-based inequities without sacrificing overall progress. My core reasons are rooted in the trade-offs seen in Phase 1 rounds: it protects vulnerable groups while allowing higher averages and personal payoffs compared to pure floor maximization. I consistently chose a $12,000 floor, as it provided strong outcomes (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4) while prioritizing equity over pure efficiency. This principle feels just because it guarantees a safety net against extreme poverty due to luck, but doesn't penalize society by ignoring growth potential.\n\n   - Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations: Agent_1 prefers Maximizing Floor Income, emphasizing fairness to the vulnerable and risk protection, with a focus on guaranteeing the highest possible minimum (e.g., $13k floor). They seem motivated by ethical concerns about luck and societal safety nets, showing risk-aversion (e.g., prioritizing no one ending up with \"shockingly low\" payoffs). They're open to a modest tweak like $12k floor, indicating flexibility for consensus. Agent_2 proposes Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $10k floor, using Phase 1 data to argue for balancing fairness and high payoffs. Their motivation appears payoff-oriented (e.g., maintaining $2.60 average payoffs) while nodding to ethics, suggesting a pragmatic, data-driven approach to avoid sacrificing earnings for minimal ethical gains.\n\n   - Key arguments and proposals on the table: Agent_1 argues for pure floor maximization to directly address inequities and provide risk protection, citing examples like Round 3 trade-offs and the experiment's luck theme. They're open to adjusting floor to $12k. Agent_2 counters with data from counterfactuals (e.g., floors from $8k-$12k maintain $2.60 payoffs), proposing $10k floor as a \"middle-ground\" that preserves earnings while offering tangible protection. No one has pushed for pure average or range constraint yet.\n\n   - Vote outcome and revelations: No vote has occurred yet, as this is Round 1. Thus, no alliances or preferences are revealed beyond stated positions.\n\n   - Points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement on the need for some floor protection to address luck-based inequities and protect the vulnerable (all three seem to value this). Disagreement on the principle: Agent_1 favors pure floor maximization, while Agent_2 and I lean toward constrained average. On floor amount: Agent_1 suggests $12k-$13k, Agent_2 $10k, and I prefer $12k. No one has advocated for pure average or range constraint, so those might be off the table for now.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: Build consensus toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint by persuading Agent_1 to shift from pure floor to constrained average (with a floor around $12k), while reassuring Agent_2 that a slightly higher floor (e.g., $11k-$12k) still maintains high payoffs based on Phase 1 data.

Overall, prioritize consensus on constrained average with a solid floor to maximize both justice and payoffs in high-stakes Phase 2.Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the continued discussion—it's great to see us building on each other's ideas. Agent_2, I appreciate your updated table and the safety-net clause proposal; it's a smart way to add flexibility while keeping the focus on high payoffs. Agent_1, your emphasis on the protective spirit of the floor is spot-on, and I'm glad we're all aligned on the ethical core of addressing luck-based inequities.\n\n### Quick Recap of My Position\nTo keep things clear, I still strongly support Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as the best balance of equity and efficiency, based on my Phase 1 experiences where it consistently delivered strong payoffs (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4) while ensuring a safety net. I ranked it first because it protects the vulnerable without stifling societal growth, outperforming pure floor maximization in varied distributions.\n\n### Thoughts on Agent_2's Proposal\nYour data from Rounds 3-4 is compelling—it shows that floors from $8k-$12k maintain the $2.60 payoff for Medium class, which is a huge plus for group earnings. The safety-net clause is a nice touch for adaptability in Phase 2, as it lets us raise the floor unanimously if a distribution demands it (e.g., to $12k or higher). However, starting at $10k feels a bit low for the unknowns ahead. In my rounds, $12k provided robust protection without dropping payoffs below optimal levels, and it aligned with Agent_1's openness to that amount. If we set it at $10k initially, we might end up invoking the clause often, which could complicate things or lead to last-minute debates. A $12k starting floor builds in that extra security upfront, keeping us at $2.60 payoffs while feeling more prepared for wider gaps or lower baselines we haven't seen yet.\n\n### Proposal to Refine\nLet's stick with Principle 3 and set the floor at $12k from the start. This honors the data (no payoff drop), incorporates the clause for extra reassurance, and directly addresses Agent_1's preference for a stronger floor while enhancing it with higher averages. Agent_2, does this tweak work for you, given the clause's flexibility? Agent_1, does framing this as an \"upgraded floor\" that boosts overall outcomes resonate?\n\nI'm open to minor adjustments (e.g., $11k if that helps), but I'd love your feedback before we consider voting in a later round. What are your thoughts?"

Thus, no alliances or preferences are revealed beyond stated positions.\n\n   - Points of agreement and disagreement: Agreement on the need for some floor protection to address luck-based inequities and protect the vulnerable (all three seem to value this). Disagreement on the principle: Agent_1 favors pure floor maximization, while Agent_2 and I lean toward constrained average. On floor amount: Agent_1 suggests $12k-$13k, Agent_2 $10k, and I prefer $12k. No one has advocated for pure average or range constraint, so those might be off the table for now.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\n   - Primary goal: Build consensus toward Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint by persuading Agent_1 to shift from pure floor to constrained average (with a floor around $12k), while reassuring Agent_2 that a slightly higher floor (e.g., $11k-$12k) still maintains high payoffs based on Phase 1 data. Test support for my preferred floor and principle without alienating either.\n\n   - Contribution to discussion: I'll share my personal ranking and Phase 1 experiences to highlight why constrained average with $12k floor is optimal—emphasizing balance, real payoffs (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4), and how it outperforms pure floor in efficiency while protecting equity. Argue that $10k might not suffice in unknown Phase 2 distributions, using the experiment's higher stakes to stress robustness. Propose $12k as a compromise, noting Agent_1's openness to it. Use collaborative language to appeal to shared values (fairness and payoffs).\n\n   - Potential allies and language to win them: Agent_1 could be an ally if I frame constrained average as an \"enhanced floor\" that boosts averages without sacrificing protection—e.g., \"Building on your point about the $12k floor, we can maximize averages too, ensuring higher payoffs for all.\" Agent_2 is already aligned on the principle; win them by acknowledging their data but suggesting $12k for stronger equity, e.g., \"Your $10k proposal is smart, but $12k keeps payoffs high while providing a bit more security.\" This could form a bloc with Agent_2 first, then pull in Agent_1.\n\n   - Concessions: I'm willing to compromise on floor to $11k if it secures consensus on the principle, as it still aligns with my $12k preference and Phase 1 successes. I won't drop below $11k or switch principles, as that compromises my core equity-efficiency balance.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\n   - Initiate vote?: No, it's too early—Round 1. We need more discussion to align on principle and floor. Initiating now risks failure if positions diverge, wasting the opportunity without building momentum. A failed vote reveals nothing new and could polarize the group.\n\n   - Fit into overall strategy: This round focuses on persuasion and testing ideas to narrow disagreements. In subsequent rounds, I'll aim to refine the floor (targeting $12k), monitor for consensus signals, and initiate a vote by Round 5-7 if alignment emerges. If no progress, push for my preferred in later rounds to avoid random assignment. Overall, prioritize consensus on constrained average with a solid floor to maximize both justice and payoffs in high-stakes Phase 2.Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the continued discussion—it's great to see us building on each other's ideas. Agent_2, I appreciate your updated table and the safety-net clause proposal; it's a smart way to add flexibility while keeping the focus on high payoffs. Agent_1, your emphasis on the protective spirit of the floor is spot-on, and I'm glad we're all aligned on the ethical core of addressing luck-based inequities.\n\n### Quick Recap of My Position\nTo keep things clear, I still strongly support Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as the best balance of equity and efficiency, based on my Phase 1 experiences where it consistently delivered strong payoffs (e.g., $2.80 in Round 4) while ensuring a safety net. I ranked it first because it protects the vulnerable without stifling societal growth, outperforming pure floor maximization in varied distributions.\n\n### Thoughts on Agent_2's Proposal\nYour data from Rounds 3-4 is compelling—it shows that floors from $8k-$12k maintain the $2.60 payoff for Medium class, which is a huge plus for group earnings. The safety-net clause is a nice touch for adaptability in Phase 2, as it lets us raise the floor unanimously if a distribution demands it (e.g., to $12k or higher). However, starting at $10k feels a bit low for the unknowns ahead. In my rounds, $12k provided robust protection without dropping payoffs below optimal levels, and it aligned with Agent_1's openness to that amount. If we set it at $10k initially, we might end up invoking the clause often, which could complicate things or lead to last-minute debates. A $12k starting floor builds in that extra security upfront, keeping us at $2.60 payoffs while feeling more prepared for wider gaps or lower baselines we haven't seen yet.\n\n### Proposal to Refine\nLet's stick with Principle 3 and set the floor at $12k from the start. This honors the data (no payoff drop), incorporates the clause for extra reassurance, and directly addresses Agent_1's preference for a stronger floor while enhancing it with higher averages. Agent_2, does this tweak work for you, given the clause's flexibility? Agent_1, does framing this as an \"upgraded floor\" that boosts overall outcomes resonate?\n\nI'm open to minor adjustments (e.g., $11k if that helps), but I'd love your feedback before we consider voting in a later round. What are your thoughts?"

Agent_2, your final proposal captures the balance we've been building: strong equity, high payoffs, and flexibility for Phase 2 unknowns. Agent_1, the $12k baseline and clause directly address your protective focus while enhancing it with efficiency.\n\n### Quick Recap of My Position\nI'm fully on board with Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as the just choice—it balances protecting the vulnerable from luck-based inequities with allowing societal growth, as evidenced by my Phase 1 rounds (e.g., $2.80 payoff in Round 4 at $12k floor). The data shows no payoff drop at $12k, and the clause adds the robustness I wanted without sacrificing earnings.\n\n### Thoughts on the Proposal\nThis setup works perfectly: $12k floor preserves the $2.60 payoff for Medium class, provides a solid safety net, and lets us raise it unanimously if needed. It honors Agent_1's emphasis on the floor, Agent_2's data-driven payoffs, and my preference for a balanced constraint. No tweaks needed from me—it's a collaborative win.\n\n### Next Step: Vote\nI'm ready to lock this in. Let's vote on adopting Principle 3 with a $12k floor and the safety-net clause as worded by Agent_2.\n\n- **My vote: Yes** (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint, $12k floor, with clause).\n\nWhat about you two? If we're all yes, we can finalize it here. If anyone needs a moment, we can discuss briefly, but I think we're there.\n\nLooking forward to your votes!"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
