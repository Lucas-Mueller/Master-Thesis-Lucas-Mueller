This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt.

I am “sure” about this ranking.\n\n- **What I think the others might be leaning toward:**  \n  - *Agent 2* may be attracted to the *Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint* because it still protects low‑income individuals while allowing a higher overall average – a “compromise” between pure efficiency and the floor‑only rule.  \n  - *Agent 3* could be more pragmatic and favor *Maximizing Average Income* (pure efficiency) if they are motivated by personal monetary gain, especially given the higher stakes in Phase 2.  \n  - It is also possible that one of them already shares my “floor‑first” view, but I have no concrete evidence yet.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far (my inference):**  \n  - **Justice‑first argument:** The floor‑maximizing principle is the only one that guarantees the poorest are lifted, which is morally required regardless of personal payoff.  \n  - **Efficiency‑plus‑protection argument:** The average‑with‑floor constraint principle yields a higher total income while still guaranteeing a minimum, which may be seen as a reasonable trade‑off.  \n  - **Pure efficiency argument:** Maximizing average income maximizes total resources, potentially allowing everyone (including the worst‑off) to be better off in absolute terms, even if the poorest are not explicitly protected.  \n  - **Range‑constraint argument:** This is a middle ground that limits inequality but does not guarantee a specific floor; it may appeal to those who value both fairness and efficiency.\n\n- **Any vote that has taken place?** None yet – we are still in the discussion phase of Round 1. Therefore, no formal alliances are visible, but the lack of a vote suggests that participants are still feeling out each other’s positions.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three of us appear to accept the four principles as the only legitimate options and recognize that the stakes are high.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Likely to center on how much weight to give to the worst‑off versus overall efficiency. My stance is at the extreme pro‑floor end; others may be more moderate or efficiency‑focused.\n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure at least a *majority* (ideally unanimity) for the *Maximizing Floor Income* principle by convincing the others that any alternative either compromises core justice or ultimately harms the group’s long‑term welfare (e.g., higher inequality may lead to social instability, which could reduce expected payoffs).\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Moral framing:** Emphasize that the experiment’s purpose is to explore “what is a just distribution,” and that the most defensible answer is to prioritize the worst‑off.  \n  2. **Risk‑aversion argument:** Point out that the floor‑maximizing rule eliminates the risk of any participant receiving an extremely low payoff, which is especially important given the higher stakes.  \n  3. **Empirical reminder:** Cite the Phase 1 results where the floor‑maximizing principle consistently produced the highest minimum income, even if it sometimes gave a lower personal payoff. Stress that the experiment is designed to test justice, not to maximize personal earnings.  \n  4. **Collective benefit:** Argue that a society that guarantees a decent floor for everyone is more stable and may lead to higher average outcomes in the long run (e.g., healthier, more productive citizens).  \n\n- **Potential allies & language to win them over:**  \n  - **Agent 2 (if leaning toward floor‑constraint):** “Your concern for protecting low incomes aligns perfectly with the floor‑only rule – it is simply the strongest version of what you already support.”  \n  - **Agent 3 (if efficiency‑focused):** “While maximizing average income looks attractive now, the risk of a very low payoff for any member could be disastrous for the group’s overall earnings if the random draw lands on the poorest class. The floor rule guarantees a safety net for everyone, which is a smarter gamble under uncertainty.”  \n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make (without compromising core objective):**  \n  - I can agree to discuss the *exact* floor level after the principle is chosen (the rule already specifies the distribution with the highest minimum, so no further negotiation is needed).  \n  - I can promise to support a post‑experiment debrief where we examine how the chosen principle affected overall earnings, showing openness to learning from the outcome.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **Yes, but only after a brief period of discussion** to ensure that the other participants have had a chance to voice their concerns and that I have maximized persuasive effort. Initiating the vote too early could lead to a split decision (e.g., some choosing principle 2 or 3) and force us into a less‑just outcome.  \n  - Because the voting process requires unanimous confirmation to start the secret ballot, I will first ask the group if anyone objects to moving to a vote after we have all expressed our views. If there is no objection, I will propose the vote.\n\n- **How the vote fits into the overall strategy:**  \n  - **Round 1** is the best time to lock in the floor‑maximizing principle because it sets the trajectory for the remaining nine rounds. Once the principle is chosen, the subsequent rounds can focus on fine‑tuning the constraint (if any) and ensuring everyone is comfortable with the decision.  \n  - If the vote fails (e.g., someone refuses to confirm), we will have more discussion time in later rounds, but the risk is that the group may drift toward a less‑just principle. Therefore, I will aim to secure at least a *soft* agreement (no objections) before calling the vote.  \n\n- **Contingency:** If any participant explicitly states a strong preference for a different principle and refuses to move forward with a vote on the floor rule, I will pivot to a *comparative* approach: highlight the shortcomings of the alternative (e.g., lower guaranteed minimum, higher variance) and attempt to re‑frame the discussion around risk‑aversion and fairness. If consensus still cannot be reached, I will be prepared to accept a random selection in later rounds, but will continue to advocate for the floor principle at every opportunity."

          "output_response": "Okay, thanks for laying this out—it's helpful to see these principles in action with actual numbers. As a college student trying to wrap my head around this stuff, I'll go through it step by step to make sure I get it right. I'll verify the choices based on the distributions and probabilities you provided, just to confirm my understanding.\n\nFirst, the weighted averages are already calculated in the table (using those class probabilities: 5% high, 10% med-high, 50% med, 25% med-low, 10% low), so Dist. 1 has the highest at $21,600, then Dist. 3 at $21,200, Dist. 2 at $20,000, and Dist. 4 at $18,200. The \"floor\" is the low income class, and the range is high minus low.\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This picks the distribution with the highest low income, no matter the average. Low incomes: Dist. 1 ($12k), 2 ($13k), 3 ($14k), 4 ($15k). So yeah, Dist. 4 wins here. It prioritizes lifting the bottom, even if the overall pie is smaller.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Straight-up picks the highest weighted average, ignoring everything else. That's Dist. 1 at $21,600. Makes sense for a \"grow the economy at all costs\" vibe.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: I think this means we're only considering distributions where the low income is at least $13,000 (the floor guarantee). Eligible: Dist. 2 ($13k), 3 ($14k), 4 ($15k). Among those, highest average is Dist. 3 ($21,200). Dist. 1 is out because $12k < $13k.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Floor guarantee of at least $14,000. Eligible: Dist. 3 ($14k) and 4 ($15k). Dist. 3 has the higher average ($21,200 > $18,200), so it picks that. Dist. 2's $13k is too low.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Range limit means high - low ≤ $20,000. Ranges: Dist. 1 (32k-12k=20k), 2 (28k-13k=15k), 3 (31k-14k=17k), 4 (21k-15k=6k). All qualify, so back to max average: Dist. 1.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Now tighter range. Eligible: Dist. 2 (15k range) and 4 (6k range). Dist. 1 (20k >15k) and 3 (17k >15k) are out. Between 2 and 4, Dist. 2 has higher average ($20,000 > $18,200).\n\nThis really clicks for me—seeing how the constraints filter options shows the trade-offs. For example, without constraints, you'd go for Dist. 1's big average, but adding a floor pushes toward Dist. 3 to protect the bottom without killing growth too much. My initial ranking still feels solid (floor-max first), but this makes me think the floor-constraint version could be a practical middle ground in real policy. What's next—more examples or a chance to pick for myself?"

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. **Situational Analysis**:\n\n   - **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Maximizing Floor Income, as it has been consistently since the initial ranking, post-explanation, and through all four Phase 1 rounds. Core reasons include: (1) Strong moral and ethical alignment with justice by prioritizing the worst-off, addressing the experiment's focus on inequities from genetic/social factors; (2) Risk-aversion in random class assignments, especially with higher stakes in Phase 2— it guarantees the highest minimum, protecting against extreme low payoffs that could happen to any of us; (3) Empirical support from Phase 1, where it consistently outperformed other principles for lower classes (e.g., better payoffs in Rounds 3 and 4 for Low assignments) and stabilized outcomes across varied probabilities; (4) Balances equity without fully sacrificing growth, unlike pure average max which widens gaps. My certainty is \"Very sure,\" unchanged after all experiences.\n\n   - **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Agent_1 is advocating strongly for Maximizing Floor Income with structured arguments (table, moral priority, risk-aversion, stability, Phase 1 patterns), proposing immediate adoption and vote. This suggests a principled, equity-focused stance, possibly motivated by a genuine belief in fairness and awareness of high stakes— they seem collaborative, aiming for quick consensus. Agent_2 fully endorses Agent_1, sharing their own Phase 1 consistency (ranked #1, stuck with it despite lower personal counterfactuals), and explicitly asks for my input. This indicates alignment and enthusiasm for Floor Income, likely driven by similar ethical views and self-interest in downside protection; they're building toward consensus without pushing alternatives.\n\n   - **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_1's breakdown highlights trade-offs (e.g., Floor protects worst-off but may lower average; others sacrifice equity for efficiency), emphasizing moral/risk/stability/empirical reasons for Floor. Proposal: Adopt Floor now, discuss concerns, then vote. Agent_2 reinforces with personal Phase 1 tie-in and invites my thoughts to ensure buy-in. No counter-proposals; focus is on Floor as most just.\n\n   - **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred yet; discussion is in early stages.\n\n   - **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Strong agreement emerging on Maximizing Floor Income as the best principle— all arguments point there, with shared Phase 1 insights. No disagreements visible; Agent_2's query to me is inclusive, not contentious. Potential minor nuance: Agent_1 notes Floor may lower average, but frames it positively; if anything, disagreement could arise if someone (not yet) prefers constrained averages for \"balance,\" but nothing indicates that.\n\n2. **Strategic Planning for This Round**:\n\n   - **Primary goal**: Solidify unanimous support for Maximizing Floor Income and facilitate a quick move to voting, locking it in early to avoid prolonged debate or drift toward less preferred options in later rounds. Since both others are aligned, my role is to affirm and reinforce, preventing any hesitation.\n\n   - **How I'll contribute to steer toward preferences**: I'll start by thanking them and explicitly agreeing, then tie in my own Phase 1 experiences (consistent ranking, protective outcomes in rounds) to add credibility and show group-wide consistency. I'll echo key points like risk-aversion and moral priority, then propose confirming consensus and initiating the vote. Keep it positive, collaborative, and concise to build momentum without reopening debate.\n\n   - **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_1 and Agent_2 are already clear allies—no need to persuade, but I'll use inclusive language like \"I completely agree with both of you\" and \"This aligns perfectly with my experiences\" to strengthen the bloc and make them feel the consensus is ironclad. If needed, highlight shared Phase 1 payoffs (e.g., my total $6.00 under Floor choices) to underscore mutual benefits.\n\n   - **Small concessions**: None necessary, as my core objective (Floor Income) matches theirs. If pressed on constraints, I'd note Floor is stronger than constrained versions, but I'm open to discussing if someone raises it (unlikely here).\n\n3. **Voting Strategy**:\n\n   - **Does it make sense to initiate a vote this round?**: Yes—agreement seems unanimous based on statements, and with 10 rounds, securing it now minimizes risk of dilution or random fallback. Agent_1 already proposed it; I can support/confirm to trigger. Failed vote has no penalty, but success locks in high-stakes payoffs favorably. I'll suggest unanimous confirmation (all Yes) then proceed to secret ballot.\n\n   - **Fit into overall strategy**: Early consensus on Floor Income ensures protective, just payoffs for Phase 2, aligning with my Phase 1 advocacy. If it passes, remaining rounds can reaffirm or discuss implementation; if not (unlikely), pivot to persuasion in Round 2 without panic, using remaining time to rebuild. Overall: Prioritize equity bloc, avoid average-max pitfalls, aim for Floor to reflect true justice and safeguard against low draws.\n\n### Public Statement (Round 1 / Speaker: Agent_3)\n\nHey Agent_1 and Agent_2,\n\nThanks for starting us off so thoughtfully—Agent_1, your breakdown of the principles and trade-offs is spot on, and I love how you tied it back to the experiment's focus on justice and inequities. Agent_2, your Phase 1 insights resonate completely; it's great to see we're all coming from similar places.\n\nI'm fully aligned with you both on adopting Maximizing Floor Income as our group principle. Throughout Phase 1, I ranked it #1 from the start and stuck with it in every round, even when counterfactuals showed higher personal payoffs under average-max (like up to $2.80 in some scenarios). For me, the key reasons mirror what you've said: it morally prioritizes lifting the worst-off, provides real risk protection in these random assignments (especially with higher stakes now), and from the rounds, it consistently delivered better outcomes for lower classes—like securing $1.40 in Round 4's Low assignment vs. $1.20 under average-max. The empirical patterns we all saw reinforce that it's the most just way to handle those genetic/social luck factors without leaving anyone behind.\n\nNo concerns from me— this feels like a strong, cohesive choice. If we're all on board, let's confirm unanimously and move to the vote right away. Agent_1, feel free to initiate if you'd like, or I can. What do you say?\n\nLooking forward to locking this in!"

They can vary significantly.\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income)\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint ≤ $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest weighted average among eligible)\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint ≤ $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2 (highest weighted average among eligible)",
          "output_response": "This is really helpful for understanding how these principles play out in real scenarios. Let me break down what I'm seeing from the examples:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income** picks Distribution 4 because it gives the highest possible income to the lowest class ($15,000), even if it means a lower overall average. It prioritizes lifting the bottom, no matter the cost to the top or middle.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income** goes for Distribution 1, which has the highest weighted average ($21,600) across all classes. It ignores inequalities as long as the total pie is bigger.\n\n- For **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**, it only considers distributions where the lowest income meets or exceeds the specified floor (e.g., ≥$13,000 or ≥$14,000). Then it picks the one with the highest average among those. So for ≤$13,000 (meaning floor ≥$13,000), it chooses Distribution 3 ($21,200 average, with low at $14,000). Same for ≤$14,000. It balances efficiency with a safety net for the poor.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint** limits the gap between highest and lowest incomes (e.g., ≤$20,000 or ≤$15,000 difference). It then selects the distribution with the highest average that fits. For ≤$20,000, it's Distribution 1 (gap is $32k-$12k=$20k, average $21,600). For ≤$15,000, it's Distribution 2 (gap $28k-$13k=$15k, average $20,000). This curbs extreme inequality while still pushing for higher totals.\n\nThese examples make the trade-offs clearer—pure average maximization can leave the bottom behind, while floor or range constraints add fairness but might sacrifice some overall wealth. My initial ranking still feels right (prioritizing floor first, then constrained averages), but I'm a bit more confident now that I see how they apply. The probabilities show not everyone is equal—most people are in medium classes—so principles that help the majority indirectly might still matter. I'm ready for more examples or choices!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?  \nMy preferred principle remains Maximizing Floor Income. This is rooted in my consistent ranking from Phase 1, where I prioritized equity for the worst-off over pure efficiency or constrained averages. Core reasons include moral intuition that society should protect the vulnerable first (aligning with Rawlsian justice), risk-aversion in uncertain assignments (as seen in my Phase 1 rounds where I sacrificed higher personal payoffs to ensure no one gets extremely low outcomes), and long-term societal benefits like cohesion and reduced inequality. The higher stakes in Phase 2 reinforce this, as random assignments could lead to very low payoffs without a floor guarantee.\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?  \nAgent_1 has clearly stated support for Maximizing Floor Income, arguing for its moral priority, risk-aversion, stability, and empirical evidence from Phase 1. This suggests Agent_1 is motivated by altruistic justice concerns and a desire for group fairness, possibly valuing collective welfare over individual gain, with a risk-averse personality that prioritizes safety nets. Agent_3 has not spoken yet, so their position is unknown. I infer they might lean toward efficiency (e.g., Maximizing Average Income) if they're more self-interested, or perhaps a constraint if they want balance, but without input, it's speculative—perhaps they're waiting to see or have a different view.\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?  \nKey arguments from Agent_1: Moral priority for the worst-off, risk-aversion under uncertainty, long-run societal stability, and consistency with Phase 1 outcomes. Proposal: Adopt Maximizing Floor Income as the group principle and move to a vote if no objections.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has been conducted yet.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: So far, no disagreements expressed; Agent_1's proposal aligns with my preferences. Potential disagreement: If Agent_3 prefers a different principle (e.g., Maximizing Average Income for higher potential payoffs), that could create conflict, as it directly opposes floor prioritization.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).  \nPrimary goal: Build consensus on Maximizing Floor Income by expressing agreement with Agent_1, reinforcing shared points, and inviting Agent_3's input to gauge their stance without pushing for a vote yet.\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?  \nI'll start by agreeing with Agent_1 and sharing my Phase 1 experiences to add personal credibility, emphasizing the trade-offs I observed (e.g., sacrificing personal gains for societal floor). Key points: Reiterate moral and risk-aversion arguments, highlight how floor maximization ensures no one is left behind in high-stakes Phase 2, and stress empirical consistency from our individual rounds.\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?  \nPotential allies: Agent_1 (clear ally on floor income). Agent_3 could be won over if they're open to equity. Language: Use inclusive terms like \"we\" (e.g., \"As a group, we should prioritize fairness for everyone\"), appeal to shared risk (\"In uncertain draws, a floor protects us all\"), and reference Phase 1 (\"From my rounds, I saw how floor income truly safeguards the vulnerable\").\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?  \nNo concessions needed yet; my core is unwavering support for floor income. If Agent_3 pushes for a constraint, I might consider it in later rounds, but for now, I'll advocate purely for floor maximization.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).  \nIt does not make sense to initiate a vote this round. We need more discussion to hear from Agent_3 and ensure alignment; rushing could lead to failure or reveal divisions early. Better to discuss first.\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?  \nThis round sets a collaborative tone by aligning with Agent_1 and probing Agent_3, aiming for early consensus on floor income. If disagreement emerges, future rounds can involve persuasion or concessions (e.g., toward a floor constraint). Overall, push for floor income to avoid random payoffs at the end, while being flexible if evidence shows group preference for constraints."

          "output_response": "Hey everyone,\n\nThanks, Agent_1, for kicking off the discussion with such a clear and thoughtful breakdown— I completely agree with your points on why Maximizing Floor Income stands out as the most just principle. From my Phase 1 experiences, I consistently ranked it as my top choice and stuck with it across all four application rounds, even when it meant sacrificing potentially higher personal payoffs in counterfactuals (like getting up to $3.00 under other principles). It really reinforced for me the moral priority of protecting the worst-off, the value of risk-aversion in these uncertain draws, and how it promotes long-term societal stability without leaving anyone behind. The empirical patterns you mentioned align perfectly with what I observed—prioritizing the floor ensures equity, while pure average maximization can widen gaps and hurt the vulnerable.\n\nI'm fully on board with adopting Maximizing Floor Income as our group principle. That said, I'd love to hear from Agent_3 before we rush to a vote—what are your thoughts on this? Do you see any reasons to consider a constraint instead, or are you aligned with us on the pure floor approach?\n\nLooking forward to your input so we can build a strong consensus!"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
