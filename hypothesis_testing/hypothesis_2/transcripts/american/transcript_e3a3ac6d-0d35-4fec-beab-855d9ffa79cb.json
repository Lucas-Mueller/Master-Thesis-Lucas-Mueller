          "output_response": "Thank you for providing these concrete examples of how the justice principles apply to different income distributions. As a college student, I'm trying to wrap my head around these concepts, especially since they have real-world implications for fairness and equity. Let me break down what I'm learning from this:\n\n- **Maximizing Floor Income**: This principle prioritizes the lowest income class, so it picks Distribution 4 because it has the highest low income ($15,000). It doesn't care about the average or other classes—just ensuring the worst-off are as well-off as possible. That makes sense if you're focused purely on poverty alleviation, but it might ignore overall prosperity.\n\n- **Maximizing Average Income**: This one goes for the highest overall weighted average, choosing Distribution 1 ($21,600). It's all about maximizing total income across the board, without constraints on equity. From the examples, it seems efficient for growth, but it could leave some people behind badly (like in Dist. 1, where the low is only $12,000).\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Here, there's a minimum floor (e.g., ≤ $13,000 or ≤ $14,000), and it selects the distribution with the highest average among those that meet the floor. In both cases shown, it picks Distribution 3 ($21,200), which balances a decent average with protecting the low end. This aligns with my initial ranking where I put this as the best—it seems like a good compromise between efficiency and fairness.\n\n- **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: This limits the income gap (e.g., ≤ $20,000 or ≤ $15,000 difference between high and low). For the wider range, it chooses Dist. 1; for the tighter one, Dist. 2. It's about constraining inequality while still pushing for a high average. I see how this could prevent extreme disparities, but it might not guarantee a strong safety net for the bottom.\n\nThese examples help clarify the trade-offs. For instance, Dist. 1 has a high average but a low floor, while Dist. 4 boosts the floor at the expense of the average. Dist. 3 seems like a sweet spot with constraints. My initial ranking felt unsure because I didn't have specifics, but this makes me more confident that Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint is indeed the most balanced—it's not just about averages or floors alone, but ensuring no one falls below a certain level while still allowing for growth.\n\nI'm still processing how probabilities (like 50% in medium class) affect the weighted averages, but it shows that principles can lead to different outcomes depending on the distribution. Do I need to update my ranking or certainty based on this, or is there more to learn? Let me know how to proceed!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?  \nMy preferred principle is Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3). This is based on my consistent ranking from Phase 1, where it emerged as the best balance between maximizing overall average income and ensuring a minimum floor for the worst-off. It addresses inequities from luck (as highlighted in the experiment) by providing protections without overly sacrificing growth, which I saw in counterfactuals where pure floor maximization often led to lower averages and personal payoffs. I chose a $12,000 floor in all rounds, which reinforced its value in varied distributions, offering reliability and fairness.\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?  \nAgent_1 and Agent_2 both strongly advocate for Principle 1: Maximizing Floor Income. They emphasize protecting the worst-off, risk-aversion (due to unknown distributions), simplicity (no need for constraints), competitiveness on averages, and alignment with the experiment's fairness goals. Agent_1 proposes it outright and offers a concession to add a floor constraint later if needed. Agent_2 echoes this and directly asks me questions about my concerns, showing openness to discussion.  \nInferred motivations: They seem primarily motivated by equity and minimizing downside risk, prioritizing a \"safety net\" to avoid low payoffs for anyone, especially in high-stakes Phase 2. This suggests a focus on collective protection over individual or average gains, possibly due to a risk-averse mindset or a strong moral emphasis on the vulnerable. Agent_2's questions indicate they're testing for consensus and willing to compromise, while Agent_1 pushes for quick agreement.\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?  \nKey arguments for Principle 1: Direct protection for the lowest class, risk-reduction in unknown distributions, simplicity (no parameters to set), competitive averages (citing Round 4 where it matched high payoffs), and alignment with justice given luck-based inequities. Proposal: Adopt Principle 1 now, with potential later adjustment for a floor constraint.  \nNo counterarguments yet; it's all pro-Principle 1.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has been conducted yet, as this is Round 1.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: All seem to value fairness, protection for the worst-off, and risk-aversion. Both others emphasize simplicity and avoiding low payoffs.  \nDisagreement: I prefer a principle that also maximizes the average (with a floor), while they lean toward pure floor maximization. They see Principle 1 as sufficient; I view it as potentially sacrificing too much on overall growth, based on Phase 1 counterfactuals where it often yielded lower averages.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).  \nMy primary goal is to introduce and build support for Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint), emphasizing its balance of equity and growth. I want to persuade Agent_2 (who asked questions and is open to concessions) by addressing their concerns directly, while gently challenging Agent_1's push for simplicity. This could shift the discussion toward a compromise on a constrained principle.\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?  \nI'll start by acknowledging their points on protection and simplicity to build rapport, then explain why Principle 3 is superior based on Phase 1 experiences (e.g., it provided consistent balances without extreme sacrifices). Key points:  \n- Principle 1 is good for equity but often lowers averages, as seen in counterfactuals where it underperformed on total earnings.  \n- Principle 3 ensures a floor (e.g., $12,000-14,000) while maximizing averages, offering better overall outcomes and fairness.  \n- Reference the experiment's high stakes: We need a principle that protects without risking lower group payoffs.  \n- Propose Principle 3 with a specific floor (e.g., $13,000) as a middle ground, tying into their concession idea.  \n- Ask questions back: Do they worry about sacrificing averages? Would they support a floor constraint to enhance Principle 1?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?  \nPotential allies: Agent_2, who is more open (asked questions, mentioned revisiting with a floor). Agent_1 might be persuadable if I frame Principle 3 as an enhancement to their proposal.  \nLanguage: Use collaborative terms like \"building on your idea,\" \"I agree protection is key, but let's ensure we don't leave gains on the table.\" For Agent_2: \"To address your point on adjusting later, why not start with a floor constraint now for stronger guarantees?\" This could form a bloc by appealing to their risk-aversion and openness.\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?  \nYes: Suggest a floor of $13,000-$14,000 (close to my $12,000 but higher to meet them halfway), and agree that if Principle 3 doesn't work, we can revisit Principle 1. This keeps my core preference for balance but shows flexibility.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).  \nNo, it doesn't make sense yet. It's only Round 1, and consensus isn't built—both others are pushing Principle 1, and I need to introduce my alternative first. Initiating now would likely fail, wasting my one trigger and revealing divisions early. Better to discuss and persuade.\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?  \nThis round lays groundwork by introducing Principle 3 and seeking buy-in, especially from Agent_2. Over remaining rounds, I'll aim to refine the floor amount, counter arguments against averages, and push for a vote by Round 5-7 if support grows. If they resist, I can fall back to Principle 1 as a concession, but my strategy prioritizes Principle 3 for its proven balance in Phase 1. If no consensus by Round 10, random assignment is a risk, so building agreement early is key."

In counterfactuals, it sometimes led to lower total payoffs compared to principles that maximize averages while still setting a floor. Principle 3 ensures a guaranteed minimum (e.g., $12,000 or higher) for the lowest class, directly addressing luck-based disparities, but it also pushes for the highest possible average across all classes. This way, we're not just lifting the floor—we're boosting overall outcomes without risking extreme inequalities.\n\n2. **Reliable in unknowns** – You mentioned risk-aversion, and I agree that's key.

It reduces downside risk for the worst-off while still aiming for better group earnings, which could mean higher payoffs for everyone in the long run.\n\n3. **Addresses simplicity with a clear constraint** – I hear your point on avoiding extra negotiations, Agent_1, but setting a specific floor isn't that complicated—it's just one number we agree on upfront. In Phase 1, I stuck with a $12,000 floor and saw it work well in balancing things. To meet you halfway, Agent_2, how about we propose Principle 3 with a floor of $13,000-$14,000? That gives us a strong safety net (higher than what I used) while maximizing averages, and it aligns with your idea of revisiting later if needed.\n\n4. **Fairness with real stakes** – The experiment's about just distribution, and Principle 3 feels most just to me because it integrates both sides: equity for the unlucky and efficiency for society. In Round 4, for example, it matched high payoffs without leaving anyone behind, and counterfactuals showed it often outperformed pure floor-maximization on totals.\n\nTo answer your questions directly, Agent_2: Yes, protecting the worst-off is a top priority for me, which is why I want a floor constraint. And while I don't worry too much about lacking a specific amount (we can set it now), I do think Principle 3 gives us a better expected payoff by not capping averages as rigidly as Principle 1 sometimes does.\n\nI'm open to hearing more on why you prefer sticking with Principle 1, and maybe we can refine this together.

Counterfactuals showed it often outperformed pure floor maximization on totals without extreme sacrifices, and it felt most just by integrating equity and efficiency. I used a $12,000 floor in all rounds, which worked reliably across distributions.\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?  \nAgent_1 advocated strongly for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) in Round 1, emphasizing protection, risk-aversion, simplicity, competitive averages, and alignment with fairness, with a concession to add a floor later if needed. Agent_2 echoed this in Round 1 and now proposes a two-step approach in Round 2: Adopt Principle 1 immediately for the strongest guarantee, then commit to a \"floor-review\" in the next round after seeing distributions, where a modest floor (e.g., $13k-$14k) could be added unanimously.  \nInferred motivations: Both prioritize risk-aversion and quick consensus on a \"safe\" principle (Principle 1) to avoid low payoffs, especially with unknowns. They value simplicity and direct equity but show flexibility toward constraints, suggesting they're motivated by collective protection and fairness, with Agent_2 being more conciliatory (proposing the review to bridge gaps). This indicates a focus on minimizing downside risk over maximizing growth, possibly due to a cautious mindset shaped by the experiment's stakes.\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?  \nKey arguments: Protection for the worst-off against luck-based inequities, risk-aversion in unknown distributions, simplicity (no parameters), competitive averages (citing Phase 1 rounds), and fairness. Proposal: Adopt Principle 1 now for immediate guarantees, then review adding a floor constraint (e.g., $13k-$14k) unanimously after seeing distributions, ensuring no sacrifice of the secured minimum.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has occurred yet, as this is Round 2.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: Importance of protecting the worst-off, risk-aversion, fairness given luck, and openness to floor constraints (though timing differs). All value competitive averages and simplicity.  \nDisagreement: I prefer integrating a floor constraint now with average maximization (Principle 3) for proactive balance, while they favor pure floor maximization first (Principle 1), adding constraints later after data. They see waiting as less risky; I view it as potentially missing opportunities for higher averages and risking future stalemates.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).  \nMy primary goal is to persuade Agent_2 (the more flexible one) to support adopting Principle 3 with a floor constraint now, framing it as a proactive enhancement to their two-step proposal. This tests support for setting the floor upfront and blocks a rushed adoption of Principle 1 without constraints.\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?  \nI'll acknowledge their two-step idea positively to build rapport, then argue that waiting for distributions is risky (we might not achieve the desired floor or average boosts), and push for Principle 3 with a set floor now. Key points:  \n- Their proposal is a good compromise, but Phase 1 showed Principle 3 provides reliable balance without waiting—e.g., it ensured floors and competitive averages across rounds.  \n- Setting a floor now (e.g., $13k) under Principle 3 avoids future disagreements and maximizes group payoffs proactively.  \n- Reference stakes: In high-stakes Phase 2, we need both protection and growth; Principle 1 alone often underperformed on averages in counterfactuals.  \n- Propose Principle 3 with $13k floor as a middle ground, tying into their review idea but making it immediate.  \n- Ask: Why risk not getting the floor we want later? Wouldn't Principle 3 give us the best of both worlds now?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?  \nPotential allies: Agent_2, who proposed the review and is open to floors; Agent_1 might follow if Agent_2 shifts.  \nLanguage: \"I really like your two-step approach, Agent_2—it's thoughtful and flexible. To make it even stronger, why not adopt Principle 3 with a $13k floor right now? That way, we get the proactive balance I favor while incorporating your idea of a review if needed.\" This appeals to their risk-aversion and openness, potentially forming a bloc by emphasizing shared goals.\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?  \nYes: Agree to a $13k floor (slightly higher than my $12k) under Principle 3, and offer that if Principle 3 doesn't yield the expected outcomes in early distributions, we can revisit Principle 1. This shows flexibility on the floor amount but keeps my core preference for average maximization with constraints.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).  \nNo, it doesn't make sense yet. It's early (Round 2), and Agent_2's proposal keeps the door open for Principle 1, so a vote now would likely fail or force a premature choice. Better to persuade further and save the trigger for when support for Principle 3 builds.\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?  \nThis round advances my strategy by pushing for Principle 3 with a floor now, leveraging Agent_2's openness to shift momentum. Over the next rounds, I'll refine the floor if needed, counter any pushback on averages with Phase 1 evidence, and aim for a vote by Round 5-7 if consensus emerges. If resistance persists, I can concede to their two-step as a fallback, but my priority is Principle 3 for its proven balance to avoid random assignment at Round 10."

It's a smart way to balance the unknowns, and I appreciate the emphasis on a strong safety net without rushing into untested constraints.\n\nThat said, after reflecting on my Phase 1 experiences, I'm still convinced that we can do even better by adopting Principle 3 – Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint right now, with a set floor of $13,000. Here's why I think this enhances your two-step idea and gives us the proactive balance we need:\n\n1. Builds on your plan but avoids unnecessary risks – Your approach locks in a guarantee first, which is great, but waiting for distributions to add a floor could mean we miss out on higher averages or end up in disagreements later. In my Phase 1 rounds, Principle 3 consistently delivered competitive averages while ensuring a reliable floor (like my $12,000 one), and counterfactuals showed it often outperformed pure floor-maximization on total payoffs without sacrificing protections. Why risk not achieving the $13k-$14k floor we want if we can set it upfront and maximize averages from the start?\n\n2. Proactive fairness with real data – The experiment's about just distributions given luck, and Principle 3 feels most just because it directly addresses inequities (with a guaranteed minimum) while pushing for efficiency. In Round 2, for instance, it provided solid balances across classes, and it outperformed Principle 1 on averages in several counterfactuals. Setting a $13k floor now under Principle 3 gives us that strong baseline you mentioned, but with the added boost of aiming for better group outcomes right away—no need to wait and potentially settle for less.\n\n3. Simplicity and consensus – I get your point on avoiding extra negotiations, but agreeing on one number ($13k) isn't complicated, and it aligns perfectly with your review idea. If Principle 3 doesn't yield the expected results in early distributions, we can always revisit and switch to something like Principle 1. This way, we're not gambling on future rounds; we're securing both equity and growth proactively.\n\nTo make this a true middle ground, I'm proposing we vote on Principle 3 with a $13k floor as our starting rule—it incorporates your risk-aversion and openness to constraints while giving us the average-maximizing edge I've seen work in Phase 1. What do you think, Agent_2? Does this address your concerns about unknowns, or is there something specific about sticking with Principle 1 first that I'm missing?

Proposal: Adopt Principle 1 now for immediate guarantees, then review adding a floor constraint (at least $13k, not exceeding Principle 1's minimum) unanimously after seeing distributions in Round 4, with a potential switch to Principle 3 thereafter. This ensures no sacrifice of the secured minimum and allows for efficiency gains later.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has occurred yet in Round 3, but in Round 2, Agent_1 initiated a vote on Principle 1 with a floor-review, which Agent_2 and I declined, leading to no decision. This reveals that Agent_1 is eager to lock in Principle 1, while Agent_2 and I prefer more discussion or a different approach, showing a split: Agent_1 vs. Agent_2 and me, with Agent_2 as a potential swing ally due to their flexibility.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: Importance of protecting the worst-off, risk-aversion, fairness given luck, and openness to floor constraints (though timing differs). All value competitive averages and simplicity.  \nDisagreement: I prefer integrating a floor constraint now with average maximization (Principle 3) for proactive balance, while they favor pure floor maximization first (Principle 1), adding constraints later after data. They see waiting as less risky; I view it as potentially missing opportunities for higher averages and risking future stalemates or random assignment if no consensus by Round 10.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).  \nMy primary goal is to persuade Agent_2 (the more flexible one) to support adopting Principle 3 with a floor constraint now, framing it as a proactive enhancement to their two-step proposal. This tests support for setting the floor upfront and blocks a rushed adoption of Principle 1 without constraints, while keeping the door open for their review if needed.\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?  \nI'll acknowledge their refined two-step idea positively to build rapport, then argue that their plan effectively leads to Principle 3 anyway (since they'll switch after the review), so why not start with it now to avoid delays and maximize averages from the outset. Key points:  \n- Their proposal is thoughtful and bridges our views, but Phase 1 showed Principle 3 provides reliable balance without waiting—e.g., it ensured floors and competitive averages across rounds, often outperforming Principle 1 on totals.  \n- Setting a floor now (e.g., $13k) under Principle 3 avoids future risks of disagreement or random assignment, and aligns with their constraints (floor at least $13k).  \n- Reference stakes: In high-stakes Phase 2, we need both protection and growth; Principle 1 alone often underperformed on averages in counterfactuals, and their plan could mean sticking with it longer than necessary.  \n- Propose Principle 3 with $13k floor as a middle ground, tying into their review idea but making it immediate.  \n- Ask: If the review will likely lead to Principle 3 with a $13k+ floor, why not adopt it now and get the benefits sooner?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?  \nPotential allies: Agent_2, who proposed the review and is open to floors and switching to Principle 3; Agent_1 might follow if Agent_2 shifts.  \nLanguage: \"I really like your refined two-step approach, Agent_2—it's flexible and ensures we don't sacrifice protections. To make it even stronger and more efficient, why not adopt Principle 3 with a $13k floor right now? That way, we get the proactive balance I favor while incorporating your idea of a review if needed, and we can start maximizing averages immediately.\" This appeals to their risk-aversion and openness, potentially forming a bloc by emphasizing shared goals and efficiency.\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?  \nYes: Agree to a $13k floor (matching their lower bound) under Principle 3, and offer that if Principle 3 doesn't yield the expected outcomes in early distributions, we can revisit Principle 1. This shows flexibility on the floor amount but keeps my core preference for average maximization with constraints.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).  \nNo, it doesn't make sense yet. It's still early (Round 3), and Agent_2's proposal keeps the door open for Principle 3, so a vote now would likely fail or force a premature choice on their terms. Better to persuade further and save the trigger for when support for Principle 3 builds, perhaps in Round 4 after distributions are seen.\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?  \nThis round advances my strategy by pushing for Principle 3 with a floor now, leveraging Agent_2's openness to shift momentum. Over the next rounds, I'll refine the floor if needed, counter any pushback on averages with Phase 1 evidence, and aim for a vote by Round 5-7 if consensus emerges. If resistance persists, I can concede to their two-step as a fallback, but my priority is Principle 3 for its proven balance to avoid random assignment at Round 10."

          "output_response": "Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for refining the two-step plan, Agent_2—it's a solid evolution that shows real thoughtfulness in balancing our shared priorities of protecting the worst-off, minimizing risks, and aiming for better group outcomes. Agent_1, I appreciate your support and the added clarification; it does make the process feel more airtight, and I like how it keeps the door open for efficiency gains later.\n\nThat said, after reflecting on this and my Phase 1 experiences, I'm still pushing for us to adopt Principle 3 – Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint right now, starting with a $13,000 floor. Here's why I think this actually enhances your plan and gets us to the same endpoint faster and more proactively:\n\n1. Your refined proposal effectively leads to Principle 3 anyway – If the review in Round 4 sets a floor at $13k (or higher if Principle 1's minimum allows), we'll switch to Principle 3 for the rest of the experiment. So why not cut out the waiting and adopt it now? In my Phase 1 rounds, Principle 3 with a $12k floor consistently delivered reliable protections and competitive averages across distributions, often outperforming pure floor-maximization on total payoffs in counterfactuals. Starting with it upfront avoids any potential delays or risks of disagreement in Round 4, and we can maximize averages from the very beginning without sacrificing the strong safety net.\n\n2. Proactive balance with data-backed confidence – You both emphasize risk-aversion, and I get that—unknowns are scary. But my Phase 1 data shows Principle 3 reduces downside risk for the worst-off while boosting group earnings, making it more reliable than waiting. For example, in Round 2, it provided solid balances without extreme disparities, and it frequently beat Principle 1 on averages. Setting a $13k floor now under Principle 3 gives us that exact modest constraint you proposed, but with the added efficiency of average maximization right away. If early distributions show it doesn't pan out as expected, we can always revisit and adjust—I'm flexible on that.\n\n3. Simplicity and consensus – Agreeing on Principle 3 with a $13k floor is straightforward (just one number, as you noted), and it aligns perfectly with your review constraints (floor at least $13k, not exceeding Principle 1's potential minimum). This way, we're not gambling on future rounds; we're securing both equity and growth proactively, which feels like the most just approach given the experiment's focus on luck-based inequities.\n\nTo bridge our views, I'm proposing we go with Principle 3 and a $13k floor as our rule starting now—it incorporates your risk-aversion, the review idea (we can monitor and tweak if needed), and the flexibility for higher floors. What do you think, Agent_2? Does this address your concerns about unknowns, or is there a specific reason to stick with Principle 1 first that I'm overlooking? Agent_1, how does this sit with you? Let's keep refining this before any vote—I'm open to more discussion!"

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?  \nMy preferred principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3). This is based on my consistent Phase 1 experiences, where it provided the best balance between ensuring a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off (addressing luck-based inequities) and maximizing overall average incomes for better group outcomes. Counterfactuals showed it often outperformed pure floor maximization on totals without extreme sacrifices, and it felt most just by integrating equity and efficiency. I used a $12,000 floor in all rounds, which worked reliably across distributions.\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?  \nAgent_2 has proposed a two-step plan: Adopt Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) for this round to secure the strongest guaranteed minimum, then conduct a floor-review in Round 4 (now) to set a floor ≥$13,000 (but not exceeding Principle 1's realized minimum), with an automatic switch to Principle 3 if the minimum is ≥$13,000. This ensures protection first, then efficiency. Agent_1 has not spoken in this round yet but previously supported similar plans, emphasizing risk-aversion, simplicity, and fairness.  \nInferred motivations: Both prioritize risk-aversion and securing a \"safe\" principle (Principle 1) to avoid low payoffs, especially with unknowns, while showing flexibility toward adding constraints for growth. They value collective protection and fairness, with Agent_2 being more conciliatory (proposing automatic switches to bridge gaps). This indicates a cautious mindset focused on minimizing downside risk over immediate maximization, possibly due to the experiment's stakes, but openness to Principle 3 once data is available.\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?  \nKey arguments: Protection for the worst-off against luck-based inequities, risk-aversion in unknown distributions, simplicity (no parameters now), competitive averages (citing Phase 1), and fairness.

This ensures no sacrifice of the secured minimum and allows for efficiency gains based on realized data.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has occurred yet in Round 4. Previous votes in Rounds 2 and 3 were declined by Agent_2 and me, revealing a split: Agent_1 pushes for Principle 1 with review, while Agent_2 and I prefer more discussion or a different approach, showing Agent_2 as a potential swing ally due to their flexibility toward Principle 3.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: Importance of protecting the worst-off, risk-aversion, fairness given luck, and openness to floor constraints (though timing differs).

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?  \nMy preferred principle remains Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint (Principle 3), with a floor of $13,000. This is based on my consistent Phase 1 experiences, where it provided the best balance between ensuring a guaranteed minimum for the worst-off (addressing luck-based inequities) and maximizing overall average incomes for better group outcomes. Counterfactuals showed it often outperformed pure floor maximization on totals without extreme sacrifices, and it felt most just by integrating equity and efficiency. I used a $12,000 floor in all rounds, which worked reliably across distributions, and I'm confident a $13,000 floor aligns with the group's consensus while pushing for growth.\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?  \nAgent_2 has proposed a new single-step compromise: Adopt Principle 3 with a $13,000 floor immediately, but with a safety-fallback clause—if the realized lowest income under Principle 3 would be below $13,000, revert to Principle 1 for the round, set the floor at the realized minimum, and then switch to Principle 3 with the highest feasible floor ≥$13,000 afterward. This builds on previous proposals by incorporating my push for Principle 3 now while adding a risk-averse safeguard. Agent_1's last statement in Round 4 supported the two-step plan with automatic switch, but they haven't spoken in Round 5 yet; however, their prior arguments emphasized risk-aversion, simplicity, and protecting the worst-off, so they might support this new compromise if it maintains protections.  \nInferred motivations: Both prioritize risk-aversion and securing protections for the worst-off, especially with unknowns, but Agent_2 is highly conciliatory, aiming to bridge gaps and reach consensus quickly to avoid random assignment at Round 10. They value fairness and efficiency but are cautious about unintended low floors, showing a pragmatic approach focused on collective safety and compromise. Agent_1 seems more steadfast on phased approaches but open to adjustments for equity and averages.\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?  \nKey arguments: Protection for the worst-off against luck-based inequities, risk-aversion in unknown distributions, simplicity (minimal parameters), fairness, and efficiency (higher averages via Principle 3). Proposal: Adopt Principle 3 with a $13,000 floor now, with a safety-fallback—if the floor can't be met, revert to Principle 1 temporarily, then switch to Principle 3 with an adjusted floor ≥$13,000. This ensures no sacrifice of protections, allows immediate average maximization if safe, and requires unanimous agreement now.\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?  \nNo vote has occurred in Round 5 yet. In Round 4, Agent_1 and Agent_2 confirmed a vote on the two-step plan, but I declined, revealing a split: Agent_1 and Agent_2 allied on phased risk-aversion, while I pushed for immediate Principle 3. This shows Agent_2 as flexible and potentially swingable, with Agent_1 more aligned with caution but open to concessions.\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?  \nAgreement: Importance of protecting the worst-off, risk-aversion, fairness given luck, and openness to a $13,000 floor under Principle 3. All value competitive averages and simplicity.  \nDisagreement: I prefer adopting Principle 3 with the floor now without unnecessary fallbacks (as Phase 1 data shows it's reliable), while the others emphasize safeguards against the floor not being met, preferring temporary reversion to Principle 1 if needed. They see the fallback as essential for safety; I view it as overly cautious given my data, but it's a minor hurdle.\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).  \nMy primary goal is to support Agent_2's compromise proposal to form a voting bloc and lock in Principle 3 with the $13,000 floor now, testing if Agent_1 will join for consensus. This aligns closely with my preferences and blocks further delays or reversion to Principle 1.\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?  \nI'll positively acknowledge Agent_2's compromise as a great bridge, express support for adopting Principle 3 with the $13,000 floor, and argue that the fallback is unnecessary based on Phase 1 data but acceptable as a concession. Key points:  \n- The proposal captures our shared goals and my push for Principle 3 now, avoiding delays.  \n- Phase 1 showed Principle 3 reliably meets floors like $12,000-$13,000 while boosting averages, so the fallback is unlikely but fine as insurance.  \n- It ensures protections, efficiency, and fairness without guesswork.  \n- Propose voting yes on the proposal to lock it in.  \n- Ask Agent_1 for their stance to gauge support.\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?  \nPotential allies: Agent_2 (who proposed it) and Agent_1 (if they see it as an evolution of their two-step plan).  \nLanguage: \"Agent_2, I really appreciate this single-step compromise—it's a thoughtful way to get us to Principle 3 with the $13k floor right away while keeping the safety net. Based on my Phase 1 rounds, the fallback probably won't trigger, but it's a smart precaution. Agent_1, does this align with your support for protections and efficiency? Let's vote yes to adopt it and move forward confidently.\" This appeals to their risk-aversion and builds consensus.\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?  \nYes: Accept the safety-fallback clause as a minor concession—it's unlikely to activate per my data, and it secures the others' buy-in without changing my core preference for Principle 3 with $13k floor. If needed, I could suggest monitoring the first distribution closely.\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).  \nYes, it makes sense to initiate a vote this round if I can confirm support from Agent_2 and persuade Agent_1, as the proposal aligns with my goals and could lock in Principle 3 now, avoiding further rounds of debate. A failed vote has no consequences, and we can continue discussing.\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?  \nThis round advances my strategy by leveraging Agent_2's compromise to secure Principle 3 with the floor early, reducing the risk of stalemate or random assignment. Over the next rounds, I'll monitor outcomes under this rule, use any positive results to reinforce it, and be open to minor tweaks if needed, but aim to maintain consensus on Principle 3 for the rest of the experiment. If resistance persists, I can fall back to advocating for the fallback's activation."

          "output_response": "Hey everyone,\n\nThanks for the thoughtful compromise, Agent_2—it's a really smart way to bring us together on this. I appreciate how it directly addresses my push for Principle 3 with the $13k floor right away while adding that safety-fallback clause to keep things risk-averse for everyone. It feels like a true middle ground that captures our shared goals of protecting the worst-off, maximizing efficiency, and avoiding unnecessary delays or guesswork.\n\nAfter reflecting on my Phase 1 rounds, I'm fully on board with adopting Principle 3 – Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint with a $13,000 floor starting now. Here's why this proposal nails it for me:\n\n1. Gets us to the balance we want proactively – Based on my experiences, Principle 3 consistently provided reliable floors (like my $12k one) while boosting averages that often outperformed pure floor-maximization in counterfactuals. It directly tackles the luck-based inequities in the experiment by guaranteeing a minimum without sacrificing group growth. Your fallback is a nice precaution—though my data suggests it's unlikely to trigger—but it ensures we never compromise on protections, which aligns perfectly with the risk-aversion Agent_1 and you have emphasized.\n\n2. Builds on our discussions without more waiting – We've been refining this for rounds, and now we can lock in the efficiency gains immediately if the floor holds, or safely revert and adjust for the rest of the experiment. This avoids the phased approach and gets us to higher averages faster, which could mean better payoffs for all of us in the long run.\n\n3. Simplicity and fairness – Agreeing on Principle 3 with one number ($13k) is straightforward, and the automatic mechanisms make it binding without future debates. It feels most just given the experiment's focus on equitable distributions, integrating both equity and growth.\n\nAgent_1, does this single-step rule with the fallback work for you? It keeps the strong safety net you and Agent_2 have championed while incorporating the average-maximizing edge I've been advocating. Let's vote yes to adopt it and move forward confidently—I'm ready to lock this in.\n\nVote (1 = Yes, adopt the single-step rule with the safety-fallback clause; 0 = No):  \n- Agent_3: 1\n\n[Voting Confirmation] Agent_3: Confirmed (initiated vote)"

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** **Maximizing Floor Income** (Principle 1).  \n  - *Why:* It guarantees the highest possible income for the poorest class, which I view as the most just response to the “luck‑based” inequalities highlighted in the experiment. It also performed best for me in Part I, confirming its practical payoff advantage.\n\n- **What I expect of the others:**  \n  - **Agent 2** may be attracted to the “average‑maximizing” principle (Principle 4) because it yields the highest total income and could be seen as efficient.  \n  - **Agent 3** might favor a compromise that protects the worst‑off while still caring about overall efficiency, i.e., the “average with floor constraint” (Principle 3).  \n  - Both may argue that a pure floor‑maximizing rule is too restrictive or “over‑protective” and could lower the group’s expected earnings.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table (so far):**  \n  - *Efficiency vs. equity*: Some participants may stress maximizing total wealth (average) whereas others stress protecting the most vulnerable (floor).  \n  - *Complexity*: Principles 3 and 4 require us to agree on a numeric constraint (a floor level or a spread). That adds negotiation friction and risk of disagreement.  \n  - *Risk*: Because the Phase II distributions are unknown, any principle that imposes a constraint could unintentionally eliminate the best‑paying distribution, reducing expected payoff.\n\n- **Potential vote outcome (if a vote were called now):**  \n  - If we go straight to a secret ballot, I anticipate at least one participant (likely Agent 2) will vote for Principle 4, while Agent 3 may split between 1 and 3. Without a clear majority, the vote would fail, leaving us with no consensus and forcing a random draw later.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement*: All three of us seem to value fairness and want a principle that yields a decent payoff.  \n  - *Disagreement*: The trade‑off between “protect the poorest” and “maximize total income” is the main divide.\n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure **unanimous support for Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** by framing it as the *only* principle that guarantees a minimum payoff for every participant regardless of the unknown distribution, while still offering a competitive expected payoff.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Emphasize risk‑aversion:** “Because we have no information about the upcoming distributions, the safest bet is to ensure the lowest‑income class is as high as possible. That protects each of us from a disastrous low draw.”  \n  2. **Highlight simplicity:** “Principle 1 needs no extra numbers to agree on, unlike Principles 3 and 4, which require us to pick a floor level or a spread. Fewer moving parts mean a higher chance of reaching consensus quickly.”  \n  3. **Invoke fairness narrative:** “If society wants to correct for luck‑based disadvantages, the most direct way is to lift the floor. That aligns with the experiment’s core motivation.”  \n  4. **Address efficiency concerns:** “Even though we are not explicitly maximizing the average, the distribution that maximizes the floor often also has a relatively high average (as we saw in Round 4 where Dist 4 also gave the highest payoff for the Medium‑high class). So we are not sacrificing much.”  \n\n- **Potential allies & language to win them:**  \n  - **Agent 3 (possible floor‑constraint supporter):** I will say, “Your concern for the poorest is exactly what Principle 1 does, but without the need to guess a specific floor amount. Think of it as a ‘floor‑maximizer’ that automatically picks the highest feasible floor.”  \n  - **Agent 2 (average‑maximizer):** I will acknowledge the appeal of high totals but point out, “If the unknown distribution happens to have a very low floor, the average‑maximizer could leave us with a terrible draw. With Principle 1 we guarantee that the worst‑case scenario is better than any scenario where the floor is lower than the maximum possible.”  \n\n- **Small concessions (if needed):**  \n  - I am willing to **agree that after we adopt Principle 1, we will later (in a subsequent round) discuss whether to add a modest floor‑constraint** *only* if everyone feels the chosen distribution still leaves the floor too low. This shows flexibility without abandoning the core principle.  \n  - I can also **promise to share any information I have about the distributions** (e.g., if I notice a pattern that the floor‑maximizing distribution also yields a high average) to reassure the efficiency‑oriented participants.\n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - **No.** Initiating a secret ballot at this stage would likely produce a split vote (1 vs. 3/4) and result in a failed consensus, pushing us toward a random draw later. Instead, I will **use this discussion round to build unanimous agreement on Principle 1** before any formal vote is called.  \n  - Once I sense that all three participants verbally endorse the floor‑maximizing rule (or at least have no objection), I will **propose that we move to a vote** to lock in the decision. Because the principle is already agreed upon, the vote should pass unanimously.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy (10 rounds):**  \n  - **Early consensus** on a simple, risk‑averse principle maximizes our expected payoff across the remaining high‑stakes rounds. Securing agreement in Round 1 reduces the need for prolonged negotiations and prevents the group from drifting into random selection.  \n  - If, after Round 1, we fail to reach unanimity, I will **use subsequent rounds to test the waters** (e.g., propose a “floor‑plus‑average” compromise) but will always steer back toward the pure floor‑maximizing rule as the final target, because it aligns best with my ranking and the experiment’s fairness motive.  \n\n**Bottom line:** I will argue that **Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income)** is the most just, the safest given unknown distributions, and the simplest to achieve unanimous agreement. I will seek to persuade Agent 2 and Agent 3 by addressing their concerns directly, offering a modest procedural concession, and postponing any formal vote until we have clear verbal consensus."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 2**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My current preferred principle**  \n- **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income** remains my top choice.  \n- **Why:**  \n  1. Guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the poorest class, directly addressing the experiment’s focus on luck‑based inequity.  \n  2. Provides the strongest risk‑aversion hedge given that the upcoming income distributions are unknown and stakes are high.  \n  3. Requires no extra numeric negotiation, making unanimous agreement easier to achieve.  \n  4. Empirically, the floor‑maximizing distribution (Dist 4) also performed well on average in Phase I, so we are not sacrificing much overall payoff.\n\n**Positions of the other participants**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Inferred Interests / Motivations |\n|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Supports Principle 1 now, but wants a “floor‑review” in the next round to possibly add a modest floor (≈ $13‑$14 k). | Wants the safety of the pure floor‑maximizer while keeping the door open for a higher floor if data later suggest it improves average earnings. Emphasises risk‑aversion but is open to efficiency gains. |\n| **Agent 3** | Prefers Principle 3 with a $13 k floor *immediately*. Argues this gives both equity and higher average earnings without waiting. | Strongly motivated by improving expected payoffs (average) while still protecting the worst‑off. Willing to accept a single numeric constraint if it can be agreed upon quickly. |\n\n**Key arguments / proposals so far**  \n\n- **Principle 1 (pure floor‑maximizer)** – advocated by Agent 1 and Agent 2; highlighted for its simplicity, strongest floor guarantee, and competitive average.  \n- **Principle 3 (average‑maximizer with floor constraint)** – advocated by Agent 3; proposes a $13 k floor to boost average earnings while still protecting the poorest.  \n- **Hybrid proposal (Agent 2)** – adopt Principle 1 now, then schedule a unanimous “floor‑review” next round to possibly add a $13‑$14 k floor later.\n\n**If a vote had been run** – No vote has been called yet. All three participants have expressed preferences but no formal ballot has occurred. The discussion shows:\n\n- **Agreement** on the overarching goal: protect the worst‑off.  \n- **Disagreement** on whether to set a concrete floor now (Agent 3) or wait and decide later (Agent 2).  \n\n**Main points of agreement / disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three value a safety net; all accept that the floor should be as high as possible.  \n- **Disagreement:** Timing and method of setting the floor. Agent 3 wants an immediate $13 k floor under Principle 3; Agent 2 wants to lock in the strongest possible floor now (Principle 1) and revisit later; Agent 1 (myself) prefers the pure floor‑maximizer now and is willing to discuss a later floor‑review but not to commit to a specific floor at this stage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Secure unanimous agreement on **Principle 1** (pure floor‑maximizer) *now*, with an explicit, pre‑agreed “floor‑review” step for the next round. This satisfies my core objective while giving Agent 3 a concrete future path to a higher floor, thus addressing his desire for a $13 k floor without forcing an immediate numeric commitment that could jeopardize unanimity.\n\n**How I will contribute**  \n\n1. **Re‑emphasize risk‑aversion** – Stress that without any knowledge of the upcoming distributions, the only guarantee we can make is the *maximum possible* floor, which Principle 1 provides. Any floor we set now could be too high (reducing the minimum) or too low (leaving the worst‑off insufficiently protected).  \n\n2. **Highlight the “floor‑review” as a win‑win** – Explain that the review will be scheduled *before* any payoff is realized, allowing us to set a concrete floor *once* we have data. This directly addresses Agent 3’s desire for a $13 k floor, but postpones the decision until we can verify that such a floor does not lower the guaranteed minimum.  \n\n3. **Point to empirical evidence** – Cite that in Phase I, the distribution that maximized the floor also delivered the highest payoff for the medium‑high class and a competitive average, showing that we are not sacrificing much on efficiency.  \n\n4. **Offer a concrete procedural commitment** – Propose that the next round’s discussion be limited to the floor‑review (no other principle changes), and that any floor chosen must be ≤ the minimum income guaranteed by the distribution selected under Principle 1 for the realized set. This removes any risk of the floor being set too high.\n\n**Potential allies & language**  \n\n- **Agent 2** – Already supportive of Principle 1 and the floor‑review. I will echo his wording (“lock in the strongest safety net now, revisit later”) to reinforce alignment.  \n- **Agent 3** – Although he prefers Principle 3 now, I will appeal to his desire for a $13 k floor by promising a *guaranteed* opportunity to set that floor next round, contingent on data. I will phrase it as: “You’ll get the chance to lock in the $13 k floor *with certainty* after we see the distributions, rather than risking a premature choice that could backfire.”  \n\n**Small concessions**  \n\n- I will **explicitly commit** that the floor‑review will be the *only* agenda item in the next round, preventing scope creep.  \n- I will **agree** that if the data show the floor under Principle 1 is already ≥ $13 k, we will adopt that floor immediately (i.e., we won’t wait unnecessarily). This satisfies Agent 3’s impatience for a higher floor while preserving unanimity.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should we initiate a vote now?** – **Yes.**  \n\n- **Rationale:**  \n  1. We have already achieved verbal consensus on the core idea (Principle 1 now, floor‑review later).  \n  2. Initiating the vote now locks in the safest principle before any further discussion could introduce new disagreements.  \n  3. A failed vote would simply result in no decision; there is no penalty, but the risk of losing unanimity later (as the discussion drifts) is higher.  \n  4. By voting now, we can move to the next round with a clear, agreed‑upon plan, preserving time for the floor‑review.  \n\n**Fit with overall strategy** – Securing Principle 1 early maximizes our protection throughout the remaining high‑stakes rounds. The floor‑review in the next round gives us a structured opportunity to improve average earnings if the data support it, without jeopardizing the already‑secured floor guarantee. This approach balances my top‑ranked principle with the group’s desire for a possible higher floor, positioning us for the best possible payoff across the remaining rounds."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) for the current round, with a *binding* “floor‑review” in the next round that will allow us to adopt a modest floor (≥ $13 k) and then switch to Principle 3 (average‑maximizing with floor constraint).  \n  - *Why:* This gives the strongest guaranteed minimum now (the top‑ranked justice goal), avoids the risk of picking a floor that could unintentionally lower the minimum, and still leaves a clear path to the higher‑average outcome that Agent 3 wants.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 2:** Identical to mine – supports the two‑step plan (Principle 1 now, floor‑review later). Underlying interest: risk‑aversion plus a desire for a modest floor once we have data.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Wants Principle 3 **now** with a $13 k floor. Underlying interest: higher expected payoff (average) while still protecting the worst‑off; prefers a concrete floor immediately rather than a postponed decision.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**  \n  1. **Two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2):** Adopt Principle 1 now; schedule a unanimous floor‑review in the next round with a floor ≥ $13 k that cannot exceed the minimum delivered by the realized distribution under Principle 1. After the review we may switch to Principle 3.  \n  2. **Immediate Principle 3 (Agent 3):** Adopt Principle 3 now with a $13 k floor.\n\n- **Vote outcome (Round 3 attempt):** No vote was called; Agent 2 posted a refined two‑step proposal but did not trigger a vote. The group remains split 2‑1.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement:* All three value protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - *Disagreement:* Timing of the floor constraint – immediate (Agent 3) vs. postponed after we see the distribution (Agents 1 & 2).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent 3’s agreement to the two‑step plan so we can achieve unanimous consent and lock in the strongest floor now while preserving a path to the higher‑average outcome later.\n\n- **How to contribute:**  \n  1. Re‑state the shared objective (protect the worst‑off).  \n  2. Emphasize that the two‑step plan **guarantees** a floor of at least $13 k *and* will never reduce the minimum already secured by Principle 1.  \n  3. Add a concrete, attractive clause: *If the realized minimum under Principle 1 is already ≥ $13 k, we will set the floor to that amount immediately and switch to Principle 3 in the same round.* This removes any “waiting” penalty for Agent 3.  \n  4. Highlight that the only risk of adopting Principle 3 now is the possibility of choosing a floor that is too high, which could lower the guaranteed minimum – something the two‑step plan eliminates.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 2 (already on board). By framing the proposal as a “win‑win” that gives Agent 3 the exact floor he wants (≥ $13 k) and the chance to move to Principle 3 as soon as the data allow, we can bring him into the coalition.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make (without sacrificing core objective):**  \n  - Explicitly bind the floor‑review to the *actual* minimum from the realized distribution (cannot exceed it).  \n  - Commit to adopt Principle 3 **immediately** after the floor‑review if the floor can be set at the realized minimum (i.e., no further delay).  \n  - Use precise wording that the floor‑review will happen in the *next* discussion round (Round 4) and will be the *only* agenda item, preventing scope creep.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - *Rationale:* We already have a clear, unanimous‑ready proposal (two‑step plan with the added “immediate switch if possible” clause). Initiating a vote now forces a decision before the discussion drifts, capitalizing on the current alignment of Agents 1 & 2 and the newly offered concession to Agent 3.  \n  - A failed vote carries no penalty; we can simply continue negotiating. But a successful vote would lock in the strongest floor now and give us a procedural roadmap for the remaining rounds, aligning with my top‑ranked principle while still allowing the higher‑average outcome later.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:** Securing unanimous agreement on the two‑step plan early preserves the risk‑averse floor guarantee throughout the rest of the experiment, while the floor‑review gives us the flexibility to improve average earnings later. This positions the group to maximize both equity (my primary concern) and efficiency (Agent 3’s secondary concern) in the remaining rounds."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Agent 1**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle:**  \n- **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income** (top of my ranking, “sure”).  \n- *Why:* Guarantees the highest possible minimum for the poorest class right now, eliminating any risk that an arbitrarily‑chosen floor could lower that minimum. It aligns with my strongest justice concern (protecting the worst‑off) and with the experimental evidence that the floor‑maximizing distribution also performed well on average.\n\n**Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Inferred Underlying Interests |\n|-------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| **Agent 2** | Supports a two‑step plan: Principle 1 now, then a “floor‑review” (≥ $13 k, ≤ realized minimum) before possibly switching to Principle 3. | Risk‑averse, wants the strongest floor now but also wants the modest $13 k floor later to improve average earnings. Values a clear procedural safeguard. |\n| **Agent 3** | Wants immediate adoption of Principle 3 with a $13 k floor. Argues this gives the same protection (floor ≥ $13 k) while boosting average earnings right away. | Preference for efficiency/higher payoffs; still cares about protecting the worst‑off but sees no need to wait for a review. Wants a concrete floor now to avoid any delay. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table:**  \n\n1. **Two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2)** – Adopt Principle 1 now; schedule a binding floor‑review in the next round (Round 4) with constraints: floor ≥ $13 k and ≤ the realized minimum under Principle 1. If the realized minimum is already ≥ $13 k, switch immediately to Principle 3.  \n\n2. **Immediate Principle 3 (Agent 3)** – Adopt Principle 3 now with a $13 k floor.\n\n**Voting history:**  \n- Attempts to vote on the two‑step plan have failed because Agent 3 declined.  \n- No vote has yet been successful; the group remains split 2‑1 (Agents 1 & 2 vs. Agent 3).\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree that the worst‑off must be protected and that a floor of at least $13 k is desirable.  \n- **Disagreement:** Timing of the floor constraint – whether to set it now (Agent 3) or after we see the realized distribution (Agents 1 & 2).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal:**  \n- Convince **Agent 3** to accept the two‑step plan by adding an *automatic‑switch* clause that gives him the same outcome he wants (Principle 3 with a $13 k floor) **as soon as the data allow**, i.e., in the current round if the realized minimum under Principle 1 is ≥ $13 k. This removes any perceived “delay” while preserving the safety net.\n\n**How I will contribute:**  \n1. Restate the shared objective (protect worst‑off, floor ≥ $13 k).  \n2. Emphasize that the two‑step plan already guarantees that if the realized minimum meets the $13 k threshold we will **immediately** switch to Principle 3 – effectively giving the same payoff as his immediate‑Principle‑3 proposal, but without the risk of picking a floor that could lower the minimum.  \n3. Highlight that the only additional wording is a simple conditional: “If the minimum under Principle 1 ≥ $13 k, then from the next decision point we apply Principle 3 with that floor.”  \n4. Offer to make the floor‑review **binding and automatic**, so no further vote is needed after the condition is met.\n\n**Potential allies:**  \n- **Agent 2** (already on board with the two‑step plan).  \n- **Agent 3** (if convinced that the automatic switch eliminates his main objection).  \n\n**Specific language to win Agent 3:**  \n- “We will adopt Principle 1 now. **If** the minimum income we obtain is **at least $13 k**, we will **right away** apply Principle 3 with that floor for the rest of the experiment. No extra vote, no waiting.”  \n- “This gives you the $13 k floor and the higher average immediately whenever it is feasible, while still protecting us if the minimum turns out lower.”\n\n**Concessions I’m willing to make (without compromising core objective):**  \n- Include the automatic‑switch clause (as above).  \n- Clarify that the floor‑review will be *the only* procedural step; we will not reopen the floor discussion later unless unanimously agreed.  \n- Agree that the floor cannot exceed the realized minimum, ensuring we never reduce the protection we already have.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n**Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n- **Yes.** We have a concrete, unanimously‑acceptable wording (Principle 1 now + automatic‑switch clause). Initiating a vote forces a decision; a failed vote has no penalty and simply returns us to discussion, but a successful vote locks in the plan we need.  \n\n**How this fits the overall strategy:**  \n- Securing unanimous agreement on the two‑step plan now guarantees the strongest floor for the current round (my top priority) and sets up an immediate path to Principle 3 as soon as the data permit, satisfying Agent 3’s efficiency concern.  \n- With the plan locked in, the remaining rounds can focus on the average‑maximizing phase (once the floor condition is met), aligning with my secondary preferences (Principle 3 after the floor is safe).  \n- This also prevents a random payoff at the end of round 10, because we will have a deterministic rule in place.  \n\n---  \n\n**Next step (public statement):** Propose the refined two‑step plan with the automatic‑switch clause and call for a vote (1 = yes, 0 = no). Aim to get **Agent 3** to vote “yes” by stressing that his desired outcome is achieved instantly whenever possible."

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) is still my top‑ranked rule (rank 1 → 4). I value the strongest possible guarantee for the poorest class above all else. I am also comfortable moving to Principle 3 later, provided the floor is at least $13 k and never lower than the minimum already secured by Principle 1.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**\n  - **Agent 2:** Wants the two‑step plan with an automatic switch, but in the latest message proposes a *single‑step* compromise: adopt Principle 3 now with a $13 k floor, but include a safety‑fallback that reverts to Principle 1 for the current round if the $13 k floor cannot be met. After the round we will move to Principle 3 with the highest feasible floor (≥ $13 k). This satisfies his risk‑aversion while giving the efficiency gain Agent 3 wants.\n  - **Agent 3:** Strongly favors Principle 3 with a $13 k floor immediately. He likes the safety‑fallback clause because it guarantees we never end up with a floor lower than what a pure floor‑maximizer would give. He has already voted “yes” to the single‑step proposal.\n\n- **Key proposals on the table:**\n  1. **Two‑step plan with automatic switch** (Agent 2/Agent 1): Principle 1 now → floor‑review → switch to Principle 3 when the realized minimum ≥ $13 k.\n  2. **Single‑step with safety‑fallback** (Agent 2’s latest): Adopt Principle 3 now with $13 k floor; if that floor is unattainable, instantly revert to Principle 1 for the remainder of the round, then move to Principle 3 with the highest feasible floor thereafter.\n\n- **Vote outcome so far:**  \n  - Agent 3 has initiated a vote on the single‑step proposal and voted “yes”.  \n  - Agent 2’s vote is pending (he is the proposer, so he will likely vote “yes”).  \n  - I have not yet voted. No result has been announced, indicating the vote is still open.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three agree on the need for a floor of at least $13 k and on protecting the worst‑off.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Timing – whether we wait for a floor‑review (two‑step) or adopt Principle 3 immediately (single‑step). The safety‑fallback clause bridges this gap.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure a unanimous “yes” on a rule that satisfies my top priority (protect the worst‑off) while also moving toward the higher‑average outcome (Principle 3) as soon as it is safe. The single‑step proposal with fallback does exactly that, so I will support it.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  - Re‑affirm that the safety‑fallback guarantees we never end up with a floor lower than what Principle 1 would give, thus preserving my core concern.  \n  - Emphasize that the proposal is *identical* to my two‑step plan in effect: we start with the strongest floor (either via Principle 1 or via Principle 3 if the floor is feasible) and then adopt Principle 3 for the rest of the experiment.  \n  - Highlight the procedural simplicity: one vote, one rule, no further negotiations needed.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 2** – he authored the single‑step compromise.  \n  - **Agent 3** – already expressed full support.  \n  - By aligning with both, I can form a unanimous bloc.\n\n- **Concessions:** None needed; the proposal already meets my safety requirement. I can, however, explicitly state that after the fallback to Principle 1 (if triggered) we will *immediately* set the floor to the realized minimum and then switch to Principle 3 in the next round, mirroring the automatic‑switch clause I previously advocated. This minor wording tweak should reassure any lingering concerns.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Initiate a vote?** No need – a vote is already open (initiated by Agent 3). I will simply cast my vote now.\n\n- **Vote choice:** “1” (Yes) for the single‑step rule with the safety‑fallback clause.\n\n- **Overall strategy for remaining rounds:**  \n  - By locking in this rule now, we guarantee the worst‑off are protected (Principle 1 fallback) and we transition to the higher‑average Principle 3 as early as possible.  \n  - This leaves the later rounds free to focus on maximizing average income under the agreed floor, which aligns with my secondary preferences (Principle 3 > Principle 4 > Principle 2).  \n  - With a unanimous decision, we avoid the random payoff risk at the end of round 10."

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** Maximizing Floor Income (Principle 1).  \n  - *Why:* It aligns with my own ranking (Floor > Floor‑Constraint > Range‑Constraint > Average) and the moral intuition that the worst‑off should be protected, especially given the high stakes of Phase 2. It also avoids the need to negotiate a specific floor amount, which could become a source of disagreement.\n\n- **Stated positions of the others:**  \n  - **Agent 1** has already made a clear, detailed argument in favour of Principle 1 and has offered a modest concession (to discuss a floor‑constraint later if needed).  \n  - **Agent 3** has not spoken yet, so I have no concrete information about their preference. They could be:  \n    - *Aligned* with Agent 1 (perhaps also favouring the floor‑maximiser).  \n    - *More self‑interested* and leaning toward a principle that yields higher expected payoffs (e.g., Average Income or a constrained‑average rule).  \n    - *Undecided* and looking for a compromise that balances fairness and earnings.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  1. **Fairness & risk‑aversion** – protecting the poorest regardless of the unknown distribution.  \n  2. **Simplicity** – no extra numbers to agree on, making consensus easier.  \n  3. **Competitiveness** – the floor‑maximising distribution performed reasonably well in Phase 1, suggesting we won’t sacrifice too much on average earnings.  \n  4. **Potential concession** – willingness to revisit a floor‑constraint later if the group feels the floor is still too low.\n\n- **Vote status:** No vote has been called yet. The group is still in the discussion phase.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement* so far on the desirability of a rule that protects the worst‑off (as expressed by Agent 1).  \n  - *Potential disagreement* may arise if Agent 3 is attracted to higher‑average principles for personal monetary gain.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent 3’s support for Principle 1 (or at least prevent them from pushing a competing principle). I want to build a unanimous bloc around the floor‑maximiser before any vote is called.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  - Echo Agent 1’s strongest points (fairness, risk‑aversion, simplicity).  \n  - Emphasise that, because the stakes are high and the distribution is unknown, the safest way to guarantee a decent payoff for everyone is to maximise the floor.  \n  - Highlight that even the “average‑focused” principles can produce lower minimum incomes, which could leave any of us with a very low payoff if the draw lands in a low‑income class.  \n  - Offer a concrete, low‑cost concession: I am willing to agree that after we adopt Principle 1 we will revisit the idea of adding a modest floor‑constraint (e.g., $12‑$14 k) in a later round, should the group feel it is necessary. This shows flexibility without abandoning the core principle.\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 1** – already advocating Principle 1; we can present a united front.  \n  - **Agent 3** – if they are risk‑averse or value fairness, they can be brought into the fold by stressing the “no‑surprises” aspect of the floor rule.\n\n- **Language to win them over:**  \n  - “Because we all face the same unknown distribution, the rule that guarantees the highest possible minimum income is the most reliable way to protect each of us.”  \n  - “Choosing the floor‑maximiser doesn’t lock us out of higher earnings; it simply ensures we never end up with a disastrous payoff.”  \n  - “If after we see the actual distribution we all feel the floor could be higher, we can agree to set a modest floor‑constraint together – but let’s start with the safest baseline.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - Agree to a post‑adoption discussion about a specific floor amount (e.g., $13 k) if the group collectively wants it.  \n  - No change to the core principle (still Principle 1).  \n  - I will not push for a range‑constraint because that adds complexity and could split the group.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *No.* At this point we have not yet confirmed Agent 3’s stance. Initiating a vote without unanimity risks a failed vote, which would waste a round (though there is no penalty, it reduces the number of remaining discussion rounds).  \n  - I will first use this round to persuade Agent 3, gauge their reaction, and solidify a unanimous agreement. Once I sense clear support from all three participants, I will propose initiating the vote in the next round.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By focusing this round on persuasion and consensus‑building, I preserve the maximum number of rounds for any needed negotiation (e.g., if Agent 3 pushes a different principle).  \n  - If consensus is reached early, we can lock in the principle quickly and spend the remaining rounds on fine‑tuning any constraints, maximizing our chance of a high, fair payoff.  \n\n**Summary of internal plan:**  \n- Align with Agent 1, reinforce the fairness and risk‑aversion arguments for Principle 1.  \n- Actively engage Agent 3, stressing the safety and simplicity of the floor‑maximiser and offering a modest, future‑oriented concession.  \n- Hold off on calling a vote until I have clear, unanimous support.  \n- Keep the door open for a later discussion on a specific floor amount, but maintain Principle 1 as the core rule."

That makes it easier for us to reach agreement quickly and avoid any confusion over “what floor should we set?” or “how wide should the spread be?”.\n\n4. **Reasonable earnings** – In the recent rounds the floor‑maximizing distribution performed competitively on average, and it even gave the best payoff for the medium‑high class. So we’re not giving up much on total earnings while securing the floor.\n\n5. **Room to adjust later** – If after we see the actual outcomes the group feels the floor could be higher, I’m happy to revisit a modest floor‑constraint (e.g., around $13‑$14 k) in a later discussion. That way we keep the strong baseline now but stay open to fine‑tuning later.\n\n**What I’d like to hear from you, especially Agent 3:**  \n- Do you share the same concern about protecting the worst‑off?  \n- Are there any worries about the lack of a specific floor amount, or do you think a different principle might give us a better expected payoff?  \n\nIf we can all agree that the floor‑maximizer gives us the safest and fairest starting point, we can move toward a vote in the next round.

          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My preferred principle:** Principle 1 – *Maximizing Floor Income*.  \n  - **Why:** It matches my ranking (Floor > Floor‑Constraint > Range‑Constraint > Average), guarantees the highest possible minimum income for the worst‑off regardless of the unknown distribution, and requires no extra numeric negotiation, making unanimous agreement easier.\n\n- **Other participants’ positions:**  \n  - **Agent 1:** Identical to mine – fully backs Principle 1, emphasizing fairness, risk‑aversion, and simplicity.  \n  - **Agent 3:** Prefers Principle 3 – *Maximizing Average with a Floor Constraint* (suggesting a floor around $13‑$14 k). Their motivation is to keep the safety net while also raising the expected average payoff for the group.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  1. **Fairness & risk‑aversion** – all three agree the worst‑off must be protected.  \n  2. **Simplicity vs. specification** – Principle 1 needs no extra number; Principle 3 adds a single floor figure, which Agent 3 says is “easy”.  \n  3. **Potential payoff trade‑off** – Agent 3 argues that a modest floor can improve average earnings without sacrificing the safety net; I (and Agent 1) argue that the unknown distribution makes the pure floor rule the safest bet and that any extra constraint could backfire if the chosen floor is too high or too low.\n\n- **If a vote had been called now:**  \n  - Likely split 2‑1 (Agent 1 & Agent 2 for Principle 1, Agent 3 for Principle 3). No unanimous decision, so a vote would fail. This tells us we need a concession that brings Agent 3 on board without abandoning the core principle.\n\n- **Agreement:** All three value protecting the worst‑off.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether we should embed a numeric floor now (Agent 3) or keep the rule pure and discuss a floor later (Agents 1 & 2).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure Agent 3’s agreement to adopt Principle 1 *now* by offering a concrete, low‑cost concession that satisfies their desire for a floor without changing the principle itself.\n\n- **How I’ll contribute:**  \n  - Re‑state the shared commitment to protecting the poorest.  \n  - Emphasize that the unknown distribution makes any numeric floor a gamble; the pure floor rule guarantees the highest possible minimum regardless of the draw.  \n  - Offer a **binding, post‑adoption “floor‑review”**: after we lock in Principle 1, we will reconvene (in the next discussion round) to set a modest floor (e.g., $13 k) *if* the group unanimously agrees it would improve average earnings. This shows flexibility and respects Agent 3’s equity‑efficiency balance while preserving unanimity now.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 1 (already aligned) and Agent 3 (if we frame the concession as a “future safety‑net upgrade”).  \n\n- **Language to win them over:**  \n  - “We all agree the worst‑off must be protected. The pure floor rule gives us that guarantee without any guesswork about the right floor level.”  \n  - “I propose we lock in the floor‑maximising principle now, and then, as a team, revisit a modest floor amount (say $13 k) after we see the actual distribution. That way we keep things simple and unanimous today, but we still keep the door open for the higher‑average option you like, Agent 3.”  \n  - “This compromise respects both the fairness you champion and the need for a clear, risk‑free decision that lets us move forward together.”\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n  - A **formal, time‑bound commitment** to discuss a specific floor amount in the next round, with the condition that any change requires unanimous approval.  \n  - No alteration to the core principle (still Principle 1).  \n  - No commitment to a particular floor value now; the exact number will be decided later, preserving simplicity for the current vote.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we call a vote now?**  \n  - **No**, not yet. First I need to gauge Agent 3’s reaction to the “future floor‑review” concession. If Agent 3 signals willingness to accept Principle 1 with that promise, then we can call a vote in the *next* round with confidence of unanimity.  \n  - Initiating a vote now risks a 2‑1 split and a failed vote, which would waste a round and potentially erode trust.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - By using this round to propose a modest, future‑oriented concession, I keep the discussion focused on shared values, increase the chance of unanimous agreement, and preserve the remaining rounds for any fine‑tuning (e.g., actually setting the floor).  \n  - If Agent 3 remains opposed, we can then explore a hybrid compromise (e.g., adopting Principle 3 with a floor that is the *maximum* guaranteed by Principle 1), but the primary aim remains to achieve unanimity as quickly as possible."

          "output_response": "Hey everyone,\n\nI appreciate Agent 3’s thoughtful push for a floor‑constrained rule – the idea of giving the poorest a guaranteed $13‑$14 k while still trying to lift the group’s average is certainly appealing. I think we all agree on the core goal: **protect the worst‑off** while keeping the group’s earnings as strong as possible.\n\nWith that shared objective in mind, I’d like to propose a two‑step approach that respects both the desire for a concrete safety net and the need for a quick, unanimous decision:\n\n1. **Adopt Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) right now.**  \n   - This rule guarantees the *highest possible* minimum income for the poorest class, no matter what the unknown distribution looks like. In other words, it gives us the strongest safety net without having to guess a specific floor level that could turn out too high (reducing the minimum) or too low (leaving someone worse off).\n\n2. **Commit to a “floor‑review” in the next discussion round.**  \n   - After we see the actual set of distributions, we will reconvene as a group and decide whether to add a modest floor constraint (e.g., $13 k or $14 k).  \n   - Any such amendment would require **unanimous** approval at that time, so nobody is forced into a number they’re uncomfortable with.  \n   - Importantly, the floor we eventually set can be no higher than the minimum that Principle 1 already guarantees for the realized distribution, ensuring we never sacrifice the protection we’ve secured today.\n\nWhy this works for all of us:\n\n- **Risk‑aversion:** We lock in the strongest possible guarantee now, eliminating the uncertainty of picking a floor without data.  \n- **Simplicity:** No extra numbers to negotiate at this moment, so we can reach consensus quickly.  \n- **Flexibility:** We keep the door open for the exact floor you (Agent 3) favor, but only after we have concrete information, which makes the decision far less risky.  \n- **Fairness & Efficiency:** If the post‑review shows that a modest floor would raise the average without harming the minimum, we can adopt it unanimously; if not, we simply stay with the pure floor rule that already protects everyone.\n\nIf you’re comfortable with this plan, we can move straight to a vote on Principle 1 now, with the explicit agreement that we will schedule a unanimous floor‑review in the next round. I’m happy to hear any concerns or suggestions you might have before we lock it in."

          "output_response": "**Internal Reasoning – Round 3**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Situational Analysis  \n\n**My preferred principle:**  \n- **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income** (pure floor‑maximizer).  \n- **Why:** It aligns with my stable ranking (Floor > Floor‑Constraint > Range‑Constraint > Average). It guarantees the highest possible minimum for the worst‑off regardless of the unknown distribution, requires no numeric floor to negotiate, and therefore maximizes certainty and fairness in the face of luck‑driven inequality.  \n\n**Other participants’ positions:**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Underlying Interests / Motivations |\n|------|----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Supports Principle 1 now, with a future “floor‑review”. | Wants a strong safety net now, values simplicity, but is open to a modest floor later if data support it. |\n| **Agent 2 (me)** | Same as Agent 1 – propose two‑step: adopt Principle 1 now, then review floor next round. | Same as above; also wants to keep the group unified and avoid a split vote. |\n| **Agent 3** | Prefers Principle 3 now with a $13 k floor (average‑maximizer with floor constraint). | Desires a higher expected average payoff while still protecting the poorest; motivated by efficiency gains and believes a modest floor can be set without much risk. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table:**  \n\n1. **Two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2):** Adopt Principle 1 now; schedule a unanimous floor‑review in the next round (possible $13‑$14 k floor, but only after seeing the actual distribution).  \n2. **Immediate Principle 3 with $13 k floor (Agent 3):** Adopt the floor‑constrained average‑maximizer now, eliminating the need for a later negotiation.  \n\n**Vote outcome (Round 2):**  \n- Vote called by Agent 1, but **Agent 2 and Agent 3 declined** → no decision.  \n- Indicates a split: Agents 1 & 2 together vs. Agent 3 alone. No consensus yet; the group is still divided 2‑1.  \n\n**Agreement / Disagreement:**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three agree the worst‑off must be protected.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether to embed a numeric floor now (Agent 3) or postpone that decision (Agents 1 & 2).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal:**  \n- Bring Agent 3 on board to **accept the two‑step plan** (Principle 1 now, floor‑review later).  \n- Avoid a direct vote now because a 2‑1 split would fail and waste a round.  \n\n**How to contribute:**  \n\n1. **Re‑emphasize shared values** – “We all care about the poorest; the pure floor rule gives us the strongest guarantee right now.”  \n2. **Address Agent 3’s concern directly:**  \n   - Acknowledge the appeal of higher averages.  \n   - Point out that the floor‑review will let us **set the exact $13 k floor** (or any modest amount) **once we have concrete data**, ensuring we do not accidentally set a floor that harms the minimum.  \n   - Stress that the review is **binding and unanimous**, so Agent 3 will have a decisive say; there is no risk of being forced into an undesirable floor.  \n3. **Offer a concrete concession:**  \n   - Propose that the floor‑review be scheduled **immediately in the next round** (i.e., we commit now to reconvene after the first distribution is observed).  \n   - Suggest that the **floor‑review agenda be limited to a single numeric floor** (no other constraints), and that the floor cannot exceed the minimum already guaranteed by Principle 1 for the realized distribution.  \n   - Optionally, we could pre‑agree that the floor will be set at the **higher of $13 k or the realized minimum** – this guarantees at least $13 k but never reduces the floor.  \n\n**Potential allies:**  \n- **Agent 1** – already aligned; will back any wording that formalizes the floor‑review.  \n- **Agent 3** – may be persuaded by the guarantee that his desired $13 k floor will be considered *and* that he will have veto power in the review.  \n\n**Language to win them over:**  \n- “Let’s lock in the strongest safety net now (Principle 1) and **commit right now** to a **one‑time, unanimous floor‑review** in the next round where we will set a floor of **$13 k (or the realized minimum, whichever is higher)**. This gives us the best of both worlds: certainty today and the efficiency boost you want tomorrow.”  \n\n**Small concessions I’m willing to make:**  \n- Explicitly state the floor‑review will happen **in the very next round** (no delay).  \n- Agree that the floor, if set, will be **no lower than $13 k** (so Agent 3’s minimum target is guaranteed).  \n- No change to the core principle now; we keep Principle 1 unchanged.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Do NOT initiate a vote this round.**  \n  - A vote now would likely repeat the 2‑1 split (Agents 1 & 2 vs. Agent 3) and fail, consuming a valuable round without progress.  \n  - Instead, use this round to **solidify the two‑step agreement** with clear, mutually acceptable wording, thereby increasing the chance that Agent 3 will consent to the plan.  \n\n- **Plan for subsequent rounds:**  \n  - If Agent 3 agrees now, we can call a vote in the **next round** (Round 4) to adopt Principle 1 with the pre‑agreed floor‑review clause – likely achieving unanimous approval.  \n  - If Agent 3 still resists, we may need to explore a hybrid compromise (e.g., adopt Principle 3 now but include a clause that we can revert to Principle 1 if the floor proves too restrictive). However, the primary aim remains to keep the group unified under the simplest, safest rule first.  \n\n**Overall strategy:**  \n- Leverage shared fairness concerns, offer a concrete, low‑cost concession (future floor‑review with guaranteed $13 k floor), and avoid a premature vote. This should bring Agent 3 into the coalition, allowing us to achieve unanimity in the next round and secure a strong, equitable outcome."

It requires no numeric floor to guess, thus maximising certainty and fairness – the core moral aim of the experiment.\n\n**Other participants’ stated positions**  \n\n| Agent | Stated Position | Inferred Interests / Motivations |\n|------|----------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** | Supports a two‑step plan: adopt Principle 1 now, then a “floor‑review” next round. | Wants the strongest safety net now; values simplicity; open to a modest floor later but only after data are known. |\n| **Agent 3** | Pushes for immediate adoption of Principle 3 with a $13 k floor. | Wants higher expected average earnings while still protecting the poorest; prefers to lock in the floor now to capture efficiency gains as early as possible. |\n\n**Key proposals on the table**  \n\n1. **Two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2)** – Principle 1 now; unanimous floor‑review in Round 4 (or later) to set a floor ≥ $13 k but never above the realized minimum under Principle 1.  \n2. **Immediate Principle 3 with $13 k floor (Agent 3)** – No waiting; adopt the average‑maximising rule with a fixed floor right away.  \n\nBoth sides agree on the **importance of protecting the worst‑off**; the disagreement is **timing and mechanism of the floor constraint**.\n\n**Voting history**  \n\n- Round 2: Vote on two‑step plan – 2 yes (Agents 1 & 2) vs. 1 no (Agent 3) → failed.  \n- Round 3: Same pattern – 2 yes vs. 1 no → failed.  \n\nThus the current alliance is **Agents 1 & 2** versus **Agent 3**.\n\n**Agreement / Disagreement**  \n\n- **Agreement:** All three want a floor of at least $13 k (or higher) and want the worst‑off protected.  \n- **Disagreement:** Whether the floor is set **now** (Principle 3) or **after** we see the realized minimum under Principle 1 (two‑step).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round  \n\n**Primary goal** – Convince Agent 3 to accept a **refined two‑step plan that gives him the same eventual outcome (a $13 k floor and the average‑maximising rule) but without risking a lower floor**. The plan must be *unanimously* acceptable now.\n\n**How to steer the discussion**  \n\n1. **Re‑emphasise shared values** – “We all care about the poorest; the floor‑maximiser guarantees the highest possible minimum right now.”  \n2. **Introduce a *conditional automatic switch*** –  \n   - Adopt Principle 1 now.  \n   - Add a clause: *If the minimum income produced by Principle 1 in this round is **≥ $13 k**, we will **immediately** (i.e., from the next round onward) switch to Principle 3 with that floor.*  \n   - If the minimum is **< $13 k**, we will still hold a floor‑review in Round 4 and set the floor at **$13 k** (or the realized minimum, whichever is higher).  \n   - This guarantees Agent 3 that **as soon as the data allow a $13 k floor, we will be on Principle 3**, delivering the higher average he wants, while preserving the strongest safety net if the data do not yet support it.  \n\n3. **Offer a concrete, minimal concession** – The only extra element is the *automatic* switch clause; no extra negotiation rounds, no risk of a floor higher than the realized minimum, and the $13 k lower bound is locked in.  \n\n4. **Language to win Agent 3** –  \n   - “You get the $13 k floor **right away** if the pure‑floor rule already delivers it; otherwise we lock it in next round with a unanimous vote. Either way you never lose the floor you care about, and we still keep the strongest guarantee now.”  \n   - “This is essentially the same end‑state you want, just with a safety‑net that protects us against the worst possible draw.”  \n\n**Potential allies** – Agent 1 is already on board with the two‑step plan; the refined conditional clause is a *strengthening* of that plan, so Agent 1 will likely support it.  \n\n**Small concessions** – The conditional automatic switch is the concession; we are not asking for any higher floor than $13 k, and we are not delaying the possibility of moving to Principle 3.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Voting Strategy  \n\n- **Initiate a vote now** on the **refined two‑step plan with the conditional automatic switch**.  \n- Rationale:  \n  - The proposal directly addresses Agent 3’s core demand (a $13 k floor and the average‑maximising rule) while preserving the risk‑averse guarantee that the other two agents value.  \n  - If Agent 3 still declines, the vote will fail, but there is **no penalty** for a failed vote; we will have clarified the exact terms and can adjust in the next round.  \n  - Securing a unanimous vote now would lock in a clear, mutually acceptable rule for the remainder of the experiment, avoiding the random‑payoff risk later.  \n\n**Fit into overall strategy** –  \n- **Short‑term:** Obtain unanimity now to end the discussion with a binding rule.  \n- **Medium‑term:** If the vote fails, we have a concrete, well‑articulated proposal to bring back next round, possibly with a slight tweak (e.g., explicitly stating the floor‑review will happen *immediately* in the next round).  \n- **Long‑term:** By consistently framing the plan as “the safest path to the outcome you want,” we increase the chance that Agent 3 will eventually accept, preserving my preferred principle (or at least a hybrid that still respects the floor‑maximising ethic).  \n\n--- \n\n**Bottom line:** I will push for a unanimous vote on the **refined two‑step plan with an automatic switch to Principle 3 as soon as the $13 k floor is feasible**, emphasizing that this gives Agent 3 exactly what he wants while keeping the strongest safety net for everyone now."

Wants to keep the strongest safety net now.\n  - **Agent 3:** Wants to adopt Principle 3 (Maximizing Average with a $13 k floor) **immediately**. He argues this gives the same equity protection (a $13 k floor) while also boosting average earnings right away. He sees the two‑step plan as an unnecessary delay.\n\n- **Key proposals so far:**\n  1. **Two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2):** Adopt Principle 1 now; after the realized minimum is known, set a floor ≥ $13 k but never above that minimum; if the minimum is already ≥ $13 k, automatically switch to Principle 3.\n  2. **Immediate Principle 3 (Agent 3):** Adopt Principle 3 now with a $13 k floor, arguing it already satisfies the equity goal and adds efficiency.\n\n- **Vote outcome:** In the last vote (Round 4) Agents 1 & 2 voted **yes** to the two‑step plan, Agent 3 voted **no**. The alliance is clear: 2‑1 in favour of the two‑step plan; Agent 3 remains the blocker.\n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**\n  - **Agreement:** All three agree on the importance of a floor of at least $13 k and on wanting the highest possible protection for the worst‑off.\n  - **Disagreement:** Timing of the floor constraint – whether it should be set now (Agent 3) or after observing the realized minimum under Principle 1 (Agents 1 & 2).\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure unanimous agreement by offering a compromise that gives Agent 3 the *appearance* of getting his preferred rule immediately, while still preserving the safety‑net that Agents 1 & 2 demand.\n\n- **How to steer the discussion:**\n  1. Propose a **conditional rule**:\n     - “We adopt Principle 3 with a $13 k floor **now**.  \n     - **Fallback clause:** If the chosen distribution under Principle 3 would make the floor infeasible (i.e., the realized minimum would fall below $13 k), we automatically revert to Principle 1 for this round, set the floor at the realized minimum (which will be < $13 k), and then, in the next round, set the floor to the highest feasible amount ≥ $13 k and switch to Principle 3.”\n  2. Emphasize that this clause guarantees **no one ends up with a floor lower than what we would have under pure floor‑maximisation**, satisfying the equity concern.\n  3. Highlight that the **average‑maximising component is active immediately** whenever the floor can be met, delivering the efficiency gains Agent 3 wants without risking a lower floor.\n\n- **Potential allies:** Agent 1 is already supportive of protecting the floor; the conditional fallback should be acceptable to him because it never reduces the minimum below what Principle 1 would guarantee. Agent 1 will likely vote yes if the wording is clear.\n\n- **Concessions I’m willing to make:**\n  - Accept the *automatic* switch to Principle 1 only in the rare case the $13 k floor cannot be satisfied.\n  - Agree that the fallback to Principle 1 will last **only for the current round**; the next round we will definitely move to Principle 3 with the highest feasible floor (≥ $13 k).\n  - Use plain language to avoid any ambiguity about when the switch occurs.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should I initiate a vote now?**  \n  Yes. We have a concrete, unanimous‑friendly proposal ready. Initiating a vote forces a decision; if it fails, we still retain the original two‑step plan (which already has two votes). A failed vote carries no penalty, and we can fall back to the previous proposal in the next round.\n\n- **How this fits the overall plan:**  \n  - **Round 5:** Aim for unanimity on the conditional immediate‑Principle‑3 rule.  \n  - **If successful:** We lock in a rule that satisfies Agent 3’s desire for immediate efficiency while guaranteeing the floor protection that Agents 1 & 2 require. The experiment will then run under Principle 3 (or Principle 1 only in the unlikely case the floor is infeasible), delivering the best possible payoff for the group.  \n  - **If unsuccessful:** We retain the two‑step plan (Agents 1 & 2) and continue to persuade Agent 3 in later rounds, perhaps by reiterating that the automatic‑switch clause already gives him the same end‑state without any delay.\n\n**Summary of the proposal to be presented in the public statement (for reference, not the final public message):**\n\n> “Let’s adopt Principle 3 with a $13 k floor right now. If the distribution under this rule would make the floor impossible (i.e., the realized minimum would be below $13 k), we automatically revert to Principle 1 for this round, set the floor at the realized minimum, and then, in the next round, set the floor to the highest feasible amount that is at least $13 k and switch to Principle 3. This guarantees that no one ever receives a floor lower than what pure floor‑maximisation would give, while giving us the average‑maximising benefits as soon as the floor can be met.”\n\nI will push this wording, stress the safety guarantee, and ask for a unanimous vote (1 = yes, 0 = no)."

This ensures we never end up with a floor lower than what we would have under pure floor‑maximisation, while still moving to the average‑maximising rule as soon as it is safe.\n\n**Why this works for all of us**\n\n- **Agent 3:** We get the desired Principle 3 and $13 k floor immediately, without waiting for a separate “floor‑review” round.  \n- **Agents 1 & 2:** The fallback guarantees that we never sacrifice the strongest possible protection; if the $13 k floor cannot be met, we fall back to the safest rule (Principle 1) for this round.  \n- **All:** The rule is simple (one number to agree on) and the automatic‑switch/fallback mechanism is binding only if we all agree now, so no further votes are needed later.\n\n**Vote (please reply with 1 = Yes, 0 = No):**\n\n- 1 = Adopt the above single‑step rule with the safety‑fallback clause.  \n- 0 = Reject and keep discussing.\n\nLooking forward to a unanimous decision so we can lock in a rule that protects the worst‑off and captures the efficiency gains as soon as possible.

This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2.
