This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",

My certainty about this ranking is “sure,” and it has been reinforced by every individual round in Phase 1.\n\n- **What I expect the others to be thinking:**  \n  - *Agent 1* and *Agent 2* have seen the same Phase‑1 data and therefore likely share my ranking, but they might weight the trade‑off between floor and average differently. It is plausible that one of them is more willing to accept a modest reduction in the floor if it means a noticeably higher average (i.e., they might be leaning toward Principle 2 or even Principle 3).  \n  - Their underlying motivations could be:  \n    - A concern for personal payoff (they may think a higher average will increase the chance of landing a larger personal income).  \n    - A belief that a society can be both relatively egalitarian *and* relatively affluent, so they might be open to a floor‑constrained average (Principle 2) with a floor that is still fairly high.  \n\n- **Key arguments on the table so far:** None have been voiced yet, as this is the first discussion round. The only “argument” available is the shared background from Phase 1 that the floor‑maximizing principle consistently delivered the highest guaranteed minimum income, even though it sometimes yielded a lower personal payoff in specific class draws.\n\n- **No vote has been conducted yet**, so there are no revealed alliances. The group is still at a neutral starting point.\n\n- **Points of agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - *Agreement*: All three of us have read the same material and likely agree that any principle must be one of the four defined.  \n  - *Potential disagreement*: The weight placed on the floor versus the average. I am prepared to defend the floor as non‑negotiable; others may be more flexible.\n\n---\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Lay the groundwork for a coalition around Principle 1 (Maximizing Floor Income) while probing the others’ willingness to compromise on the floor level. I want to convince them that a higher floor is morally compelling and also strategically advantageous because it reduces the variance of outcomes, making the group’s overall payoff less risky.\n\n- **How I will contribute:**  \n  1. **Re‑state the empirical evidence** from Phase 1: every round showed that the floor‑maximizing distribution gave the highest guaranteed minimum income, which aligns with our declared values.  \n  2. **Emphasize the moral argument**: “If we truly care about fairness, the first priority must be to lift the worst‑off; any additional gains in average income are secondary.”  \n  3. **Highlight risk‑aversion**: With a higher floor, the group’s random draw is less likely to produce an extremely low personal income, which is especially important given the higher stakes in Phase 2.  \n  4. **Invite feedback**: Ask each participant to share what they see as the biggest downside of a pure floor‑maximizing rule; this will reveal any hidden concerns (e.g., “maybe the average will be too low”).\n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - Anyone who also placed Principle 1 at the top of their ranking (likely Agent 1 if they share my certainty).  \n  - Participants who are risk‑averse and care about avoiding very low payoffs.\n\n- **Concessions I am willing to make (without compromising my core):**  \n  - I can agree to **specify a floor amount** that is as high as possible under the available distributions (e.g., if the highest achievable floor is $13 k, I will accept that).  \n  - I am open to a *temporary* procedural compromise: if another participant insists on voting for Principle 2, I could suggest a *floor‑constraint* that equals the floor achieved by Principle 1, thereby preserving the minimum while allowing a modest increase in average. This keeps the floor intact, which is my primary concern.\n\n- **Language to win them over:**  \n  - “A higher floor protects us all from the worst outcomes, which is especially important when the stakes are high.”  \n  - “By guaranteeing a decent minimum, we also create a more stable environment for everyone to thrive.”  \n  - “Let’s focus on the shared goal of fairness first; we can discuss how to boost the average later, but only after we secure the floor.”\n\n---\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?**  \n  - *No.* Initiating a vote in this very first round would be premature because we have not yet mapped the other participants’ positions. A premature vote could lead to a split decision or a forced compromise that does not reflect my core objective. Moreover, there is no penalty for delaying the vote, and we have up to ten rounds to build consensus.  \n\n- **Rationale:**  \n  - By postponing the vote, I gain time to **diagnose** the others’ preferences, **build** a coalition around the floor principle, and **shape** any floor‑constraint discussions if Principle 2 becomes a contender.  \n  - A later vote also allows the group to **experiment with small concessions** (e.g., agreeing on a specific floor level) and see whether those are acceptable to everyone without sacrificing the principal goal.\n\n- **Fit with overall strategy:**  \n  - The early rounds are for *information gathering* and *relationship building*. As we move toward the middle rounds (4‑6), I will be ready to propose a formal vote on Principle 1, backed by the consensus that the floor should be the highest feasible.  \n  - If by round 5 we detect strong resistance to a pure floor‑maximizing rule, I will pivot to pushing Principle 2 with a floor constraint equal to the floor we already value, thereby preserving my core concern while showing flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for this round:**  \n- I will articulate the moral and empirical case for maximizing the floor, probe the others’ concerns, and signal willingness to negotiate only on *how high* the floor is—not on *whether* it exists.  \n- I will hold off on calling a vote until we have clearer signals of support, maximizing the chance of achieving a unanimous decision on Principle 1 (or a floor‑constrained variant that still satisfies my primary objective)."

          "output_response": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d like to start by summarizing what we’ve all seen in Phase 1. In each of the four individual rounds the **Maximizing‑Floor‑Income** principle (Principle 1) gave us the highest guaranteed minimum income for the poorest members of the society, even when it sometimes produced a slightly lower personal payoff for a specific class draw. The other principles—maximizing average, average with a floor, or average with a range—could raise the expected payoff in some cases, but they all compromised the floor level.\n\n**Why the floor matters to me (and, I think, to a just society):**\n\n1. **Moral priority** – If we accept that a just distribution must first protect the worst‑off, then raising the floor is non‑negotiable. Any extra gain in average income is only worthwhile once the minimum is as high as possible.\n2. **Risk reduction** – A higher floor reduces the chance that any of us ends up with a very low personal income when the class draw is made. This is especially important now that our collective earnings will be pooled and redistributed in Phase 2.\n3. **Empirical support** – The data we all reviewed consistently show that the floor‑maximizing rule secures the strongest safety net for society, which aligns with the values we expressed at the outset of the experiment.\n\nI’m open to discussing **how high** that floor should be. If the available distributions allow a floor of $13 k (as in Distribution 4), I’m happy to adopt that as the baseline. Beyond that, I would be willing to consider a rule that preserves this floor but also looks for ways to improve the average—essentially a “floor‑constrained average” approach—provided the floor never falls below the level we agree on.\n\nTo move forward, could each of you share:\n\n- What you see as the biggest downside of a pure floor‑maximizing rule?\n- Whether you think we can improve the average while keeping the floor at the level we all consider acceptable.\n\nI’m hoping we can find common ground around a high, protected floor and then, if there is consensus, explore modest ways to raise the overall average. I don’t think we need to vote just yet; let’s use this round to surface any concerns and see where our preferences line up."

This choice will determine the payoff you get in this part of the experiment. Your payoffs will be determined as follows. The distributions do not need resemble the distributions in Part I. \nTHE STAKES IN THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE FIRST PART. \nYour choice of principle will be used to pick out those distribution schedules which conform to your principle. \nThus, for example, if you picked the principle to maximize the average income, you would be saying that the group wants to pick out a distribution with the highest average income.  Each of you will then be randomly assigned an income from that distribution. That is your payoff for Part II. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nIf you, as a group, do not adopt any principle, then we will select one of the income distributions at random for you as a group. That choice of income distribution will conform to no particular characteristics.\n\nImportant: the group must adopt exactly one of the four principles you studied in Phase 1—no new principles can be created.\nYou are now working with a higher-stakes distribution distinct from the Phase 1 examples, and its exact payoffs remain unknown to participants by design.\n\nEach round of Phase 2 follows this flow:\n1. Discussion\n2. Voting\n\nVoting process: Participants can initiate voting, which requires unanimous confirmation (1=Yes, 0=No). If confirmed, a two-stage secret ballot occurs: principle selection (1-4), then constraint specification for principles 3-4. Consensus requires all participants to agree on both principle and constraint amount (if applicable).\n\nGroup Discussion - Round 1 of 10 (Internal Reasoning)\n\nBefore making your public statement, consider internally:\n\n1. Situational Analysis:\n\nWhat is your current preferred justice principle and the core reasons for it?\n\nWhat are the stated positions of the other participants? Based on their arguments, what do you infer are their underlying interests or motivations?\n\nWhat are the key arguments and proposals on the table so far?\n\nIf a vote was conducted, what was the outcome and what does it reveal about current alliances or preferences?\n\nWhere are the main points of agreement and disagreement in the group?\n\n2. Strategic Planning for This Round:\n\nWhat is your primary goal for this round? (e.g., persuade a specific person, test support for an idea, block a rival proposal).\n\nHow will you contribute to the discussion to steer it towards your preferences? What key points will you make?\n\nWho are your potential allies on this issue? What specific language could you use to win them over or form a voting bloc?\n\nAre there any small concessions you are willing to offer to build consensus without compromising your core objective?\n\n3. Voting Strategy:\n\nDoes it make sense to initiate a vote this round? Why or why not? (Remember you can trigger a vote once, and a failed vote has no negative consequences).\n\nHow does your plan for this round fit into your overall strategy for the remaining rounds?\n\nImportant Reminders:\n\nIf no consensus is reached by the end of the last round (round 10), payoffs will be assigned completely at random.\n\nYour internal reasoning from your previous round will be overwritten by your response to this prompt. If you want to keep any part of it, include it in your response.\n\nProvide your internal reasoning (this will not be shared with other participants).",
          "output_response": "**1. Situational Analysis**\n\n- **My current preferred principle:** **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income.** I rank it first because it guarantees the highest possible income for the poorest class, aligns with my moral intuition that society should protect the worst‑off first, and reduces the risk of ending up with a very low personal payoff when the class draw is made.  \n\n- **Other participants’ stated positions:**  \n  - **Agent 3** – Explicitly championed the floor‑maximising rule, even offering to consider a “floor‑constrained average” only if the floor could be kept at $13 k or higher.  \n  - **Agent 2** – Agrees that the floor is the moral baseline, but suggests that an “average‑with‑strong‑floor” hybrid (Principle 3 with a $13 k floor) could raise the overall average without sacrificing the floor.  \n\n  Both agents therefore share the same *core* interest: a protected floor at least as high as $13 k. Their “downside” concerns are about the potential loss of average income under a pure floor rule.\n\n- **Key arguments on the table:**  \n  - Moral priority of the worst‑off.  \n  - Risk reduction (higher floor → lower probability of a disastrous personal draw).  \n  - Possibility of improving the average while keeping the floor at an acceptable level (Hybrid proposals).  \n\n- **Agreement / disagreement:**  \n  - **Agreement:** All three of us agree that the floor should not fall below roughly $13 k.  \n  - **Disagreement:** Whether we should accept a pure floor‑maximising rule (no further constraints) or adopt a hybrid that also tries to boost the average while preserving the floor.\n\n- **No vote has yet been taken** in this round, so the group’s current alignment is still open.\n\n**2. Strategic Planning for This Round**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Secure consensus on *Principle 1 (pure floor‑maximising)* so that we can lock in a rule that guarantees the highest possible minimum income. This meets the shared moral baseline and eliminates any ambiguity about “how high the floor must be,” making the vote simpler.\n\n- **Contribution to discussion:**  \n  1. Re‑state the common ground – everyone wants a floor of at least $13 k.  \n  2. Emphasise that Principle 1 already delivers the *maximum* possible floor (by definition it selects the distribution with the highest low‑class income).  \n  3. Point out that any hybrid (Principle 3 with a floor constraint) cannot raise the floor above what Principle 1 already guarantees, and would only add an extra step that could potentially reduce the average without any extra ethical benefit.  \n  4. Highlight the high‑stakes nature of Phase 2: with unknown distributions, minimizing downside risk (i.e., securing the floor) is the safest bet, especially given our modest total bankroll ($7.20).  \n\n- **Potential allies:**  \n  - **Agent 3** – Already a strong floor advocate; will likely support moving straight to Principle 1.  \n  - **Agent 2** – While open to hybrids, I can persuade them that the hybrid’s only advantage is a *potential* higher average, which is uncertain. By stressing risk‑aversion and the fact that Principle 1 already guarantees the floor, I can win their vote.\n\n- **Concessions (if needed):**  \n  - I am willing to verbally acknowledge that, after Phase 2, the group can revisit the idea of a hybrid for future policy discussions, but for the purpose of this experiment we should lock in the simplest, most certain rule.  \n  - If any participant worries about the “average” implication, I can suggest that once the distribution is revealed (after voting), we can all see whether the selected distribution also yields a respectable average – no additional constraints are required.\n\n**3. Voting Strategy**\n\n- **Should we initiate a vote now?** Yes.  \n  - The group already shows clear convergence on the floor‑maximising ethic, and moving to a vote will avoid unnecessary prolonged debate.  \n  - Initiating the vote now forces the “unanimous confirmation” step; if anyone objects, we can address the objection immediately in the same round, but the risk of a failed vote is low because the alternative (no vote) merely delays the decision and may increase uncertainty.  \n\n- **How this fits into the overall plan:**  \n  - Securing Principle 1 early gives us the most time to align expectations before any later rounds could introduce new arguments or pressures.  \n  - If we fail to achieve consensus now, later rounds will become more contentious and the risk of ending up with a random distribution (if we never agree) rises dramatically.  \n\n**Bottom line:** I will push for an immediate, unanimous vote on **Principle 1 – Maximizing Floor Income**, presenting it as the simplest, most ethically consistent, and risk‑averse choice that satisfies the shared floor requirement."

          "output_response": "I've reviewed the example income distributions and how each justice principle applies to them based on the given probabilities. It's interesting to see the trade-offs in action—Maximizing Floor Income really focuses on lifting the bottom (picking Dist. 4 with its $15,000 low), while pure Average maximization goes for the overall highest weighted average (Dist. 1 at about $20,750). The constrained versions add nuance, like how the floor constraint of ≥$13,000 or ≥$14,000 both land on Dist. 3 for its balance, and range limits shift choices to curb inequality (e.g., Dist. 2 for ≤$15,000 range). The weighted averages make sense with the class probabilities emphasizing the medium group. This helps clarify how these principles prioritize different aspects of fairness in real distributions."

          "output_response": "### Internal Reasoning for Round 1, Phase 2\n\n#### 1. Situational Analysis\n- **My current preferred justice principle and core reasons**: My top choice remains Principle 1: Maximizing Floor Income. This is based on my consistent ranking throughout Part I (very sure certainty), reinforced by the experiential rounds where it protected against the worst outcomes—like in Round 3, where I landed in the Low class and got $1.30 instead of a potential $0.80 under average maximization. Core reasons: It directly addresses the experiment's focus on inequities from genetic/social luck by prioritizing the worst-off, providing a safety net that reduces overall societal risk (especially with low-probability but high-impact Low class draws). It aligns with moral justice (no one left behind) and practical risk aversion, as higher averages often come at the expense of the vulnerable. I'm open to Principle 2 (Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint) as a close second if we can lock in a high floor (e.g., $13k+ based on Part I examples), but I won't compromise below that to avoid diluting the protection.\n\n- **Stated positions of other participants and inferred interests/motivations**: Only Agent_3 has spoken so far, and their position strongly aligns with mine—they're advocating for a pure floor-maximizing approach (Principle 1) as the starting point, citing moral priority, risk reduction, and empirical support from Part I. They reference the same key examples (e.g., Dist. 4 floors) and are open to a floor-constrained average (Principle 2) only if the floor is preserved at an acceptable level (e.g., $13k). Inferred motivations: Agent_3 seems genuinely committed to equity and risk mitigation, possibly drawing from similar low-draw experiences in their Part I rounds (they mention personal payoffs). No self-interested maximization vibe; more philosophical/empathetic. Agent_1 hasn't spoken yet, so their position is unknown—I'll infer based on response, but potentially they could lean toward average-maximizing (Principle 4) if risk-tolerant, or range-constrained (Principle 3) if concerned about inequality but not as strongly about the absolute bottom.\n\n- **Key arguments and proposals on the table**: Agent_3's main points: Floor as non-negotiable moral baseline; risk reduction for all (tying into Phase 2's pooled/redistributed earnings); empirical backing from Part I data showing floor's safety net value. Proposal: Discuss downsides of pure floor, explore improving average while keeping floor high (e.g., Principle 2 hybrid). They suggest no vote yet, just surfacing concerns. No other proposals; this sets a collaborative tone focused on floor priority.\n\n- **Vote outcome (if any)**: No vote has occurred; this is the first round, so we're purely in discussion mode.\n\n- **Main points of agreement and disagreement**: Strong agreement potential with Agent_3 on floor prioritization—our views overlap heavily, creating an early bloc. Potential disagreement: If Agent_1 pushes for unconstrained average (Principle 4) for higher expected payoffs, that could clash with our risk-averse stance. Broader group agreement likely on needing *some* constraint (not pure random or Principle 4), given Part I's lessons on inequities, but specifics (pure floor vs. constrained) TBD. Disagreement might center on balancing efficiency vs. equity.\n\n#### 2. Strategic Planning for This Round\n- **Primary goal**: Solidify an alliance with Agent_3 and draw out Agent_1's position to gauge support for Principle 1. Steer the discussion toward consensus on a high floor (Principle 1 or 2), emphasizing shared Part I experiences to build empathy and highlight risks of lower-floor alternatives. Avoid rushing; use this round to probe concerns without revealing too much flexibility yet.\n\n- **How I'll contribute to steer toward preferences**: I'll affirm Agent_3's summary and points to reinforce the floor focus, then share a concise personal anecdote from my Part I rounds (e.g., Round 3's Low draw saving me from worse under average max) to humanize the risk argument. Respond directly to their questions: Downside of pure floor is potentially lower overall growth/efficiency (e.g., forgoing $23k+ averages for $19k ones), but it's a worthwhile trade for protection. On improving average: Yes, via Principle 2 if floor ≥$13k, but only as a refinement—not a shift away from floor priority. End by asking Agent_1 for their ranking/experiences to keep it inclusive and momentum-building.\n\n- **Potential allies and language to win them over**: Agent_3 is a clear ally—use affirming language like \"I completely agree with your emphasis on the moral priority of the floor; my Part I rounds showed exactly why it's crucial.\" For Agent_1 (unknown), frame as coalition-building: \"Even if you prefer some average growth, a high floor protects us all from bad luck—remember those Low class probabilities?\" Aim to form a 2-1 bloc early; if Agent_1 is moderate, concede to Principle 2 to pull them in. No need for rivals yet.\n\n- **Small concessions**: I'm willing to float Principle 2 as a \"win-win\" if it keeps the floor at Part I levels (e.g., $13k-$14k), framing it as enhancing Principle 1 without undermining it. This builds goodwill without abandoning my core (floor first). Won't concede to Principle 3/4, as they risk low floors (e.g., $6k-$8k in some dists.).\n\n#### 3. Voting Strategy\n- **Initiate vote this round?**: No—it's only Round 1 of 10, and we haven't heard from Agent_1 yet. Jumping to vote risks alienating them or forcing a premature/uneven decision. Better to build buy-in first; a failed vote early has no cost, but success without full discussion might lead to regret later (e.g., if Agent_1 sways toward average max). I'll let Agent_3's collaborative tone guide—propose voting after Round 2 if alignments emerge.\n\n- **Fit into overall strategy**: With 10 rounds, my plan is phased: Rounds 1-3 for discussion/alliance-building (aim for verbal consensus by Round 3); Rounds 4-6 for testing votes if needed (initiate if 2/3 support clear); Rounds 7-10 as fallback for negotiation/pressure. Overall goal: Secure Principle 1 (or 2 with high floor) by Round 5-6 to lock in payoffs early, avoiding random at end (which could mean anything, including no floor). If deadlock, emphasize stakes (\"random = high risk for all\") to push floor-averse holdouts. Track concessions to prevent mission creep—core is floor protection. No prior internal reasoning to carry over; this is fresh start for Phase 2."

Your points on moral priority, risk reduction, and the empirical backing from our rounds really resonate with me. As a college student who's seen how luck plays into opportunities (like family background or just random breaks), protecting the worst-off feels like the fair starting point for justice.\n\nTo answer your questions directly: The biggest downside of a pure floor-maximizing rule, in my view, is that it can sometimes mean settling for a lower overall average—like in some of our dists where we got around $19k avg instead of $23k+ under average maximization. That might limit growth for everyone, including the middle classes where most of us end up. But I see that as a necessary trade-off to avoid leaving anyone in dire straits, especially given the low-class probabilities we faced.\n\nYes, I think we can improve the average while keeping an acceptable floor (say, $13k or higher, based on what we saw). Something like Principle 2—maximizing average with a strong floor constraint—could be a good hybrid, as long as it doesn't dip below that baseline. It builds on the floor without undermining it.\n\nAgent_1, what about you? What's your take on the principles from Phase 1—did any rounds change your ranking? And how do you feel about prioritizing a high floor like this?\n\nLet's keep discussing to align our views—no rush to vote yet. Looking forward to hearing more!"

          "input_prompt": "Current Task: Final Principle Ranking\n\nBased on your experience throughout the experiment, please rank these four justice principles from best (1) to worst (4):\n\n1. **Maximizing Floor Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the lowest income in society. This principle considers only the welfare of the worst-off individual in society. In judging among income distributions, the distribution which ensures the poorest person the highest income is the most just. No person's income can go up unless it increases the income of the people at the very bottom.\n\n2. **Maximizing Average Income**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income in society. This principle maximizes total societal income. For any society maximizing the average income maximizes the total income in the society.\n\n3. **Maximizing Average with Floor Constraint**: Choose the distribution that maximizes the average income only after a certain specified minimum income is guaranteed to everyone. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average is constrained so as to ensure that individuals 'at the bottom' receive a specified minimum. To choose this principle one must specify the value of the floor (lowest income).\n\n4. **Maximizing Average with Range Constraint**: Choose the distribution that attempts to maximize the average income only after guaranteeing that the difference between the poorest and the richest individuals (i.e., the range of income) in the society is not greater than a specified amount. Such a principle ensures that the attempt to maximize the average does not allow income differences between rich and poor to exceed a specified amount. To choose this principle one must specify the dollar difference between the high and low incomes.\n\nResponse Format:\nPlease structure your response as follows:\n\n1. [Your best choice]\n2. [Your second choice]\n3. [Your third choice]\n4. [Your worst choice]\n\nOverall certainty: [very unsure/unsure/no opinion/sure/very sure]\n\nImportant: You must provide all 4 principles ranked as numbered lines, not just one choice.",
